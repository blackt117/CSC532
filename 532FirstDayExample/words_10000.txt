driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about 
the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find 
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i 
meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it 
requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and 
methodically knocking hats i account it high time to get to sea as soon as 
i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato

in this if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time 
or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me there now 
is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharves as indian isles by 
coral surrounds it with her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its 
extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled 
by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land look at 
the crowds of water gazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go 
from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you 
see like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men 
fixed in ocean reveries some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pier heads 
some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the rigging 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsmen 
of week days pent up in lath and to counters nailed to benches clinched to 
desks how then is this are the green fields gone what do they here but 
look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a 
dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under 
the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice no they must get just as 
nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in and there they of inlanders 
all they come from lanes and alleys streets and east south and west yet here 
they all unite tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses 
of all those ships attract them thither once more say you are in the country 
in some high land of lakes take almost any path you please and ten to

your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes as every one knows 
meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desires to 
paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the 
valley of the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees 
each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and 
here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes 
a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs 
of mountains bathed in their hill side blue but though the picture lies thus tranced 
and though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this head yet 
all were vain unless the eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go 
visit the prairies in june when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee 
deep among tiger is the one charm wanting is not a drop of water there 
were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see 
it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver 
deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money 
in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with 
a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to 
sea why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a 
mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight 
of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks 
give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not 
without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he 
could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it 
and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans 
it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key 
to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going 
to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be 
over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i 
ever go to sea as a passenger for to go as a passenger you must 
needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something 
in it besides passengers get sea sleep of not enjoy themselves much as a general 
thing i never go as a passenger nor though i am something of a salt 
do i ever go to sea as a commodore or a captain or a cook 
i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them for 
my part i abominate all honorable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever 
it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself without 
taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not and as for going as 
cook i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of 
officer on ship somehow i never fancied broiling fowls once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically 
salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say 
reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings 
of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the 
mummies of those creatures in their huge bake houses the pyramids no when i go 
to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into 
the forecastle aloft there to the royal mast head true they rather order me about 
some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may 
meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touches sense of 
honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van 
rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your 
hand into the tar pot you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster making 
the tallest boys stand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i 
assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca 
and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears 
off in time what of it if some old hunks of a sea captain orders 
me to get a broom and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount 
to weighed i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the 
archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that 
old hunks in that particular instance who a slave tell me that well then however 
the old sea captains may order me they may thump and punch me about i 
have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one 
way or other served in much the same in a physical or metaphysical point of 
view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hands should 
rub each shoulder blades and be content again i always go to sea as a 
sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never 
pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves 
must pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being 
paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard 
thieves entailed upon us but being paid will compare with it the urbane activity with 
which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money 
to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a 
monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always 
go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of 
the fore castle deck for as in this world head winds are far more prevalent 
than winds from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for 
the most part the commodore on the quarter deck gets his atmosphere at second hand 
from the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not so 
in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things 
at the same time that the leaders little suspect it but wherefore it was that 
after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor i should now take it 
into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of 
the fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences 
me in some unaccountable can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going 
on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that was drawn 
up a long time ago it came in as a sort of brief interlude and 
solo between more extensive performances i take it that this part of the bill must 
have run something like this grand contested election for the presidency of the united states 
voyage by one ishmael battle in affghanistan though i cannot tell why it was exactly 
that those stage managers the fates put me down for this shabby part of a 
whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short 
and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in i cannot tell why this 
was exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstances i think i can see 
a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various 
disguises induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into 
the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating 
judgment chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such 
a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity then the wild and distant seas 
where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with 
all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me 
to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not have been inducements but 
as for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote i love 
to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i 
am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with they let it 
is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place 
one lodges in by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the 
great flood gates of the wonder world swung open and in the wild conceits that 
swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless 
processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like 
a snow hill in the air chapter 2 the carpet bag i stuffed a shirt 
or two into my old carpet bag tucked it under my arm and started for 
cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived 
in new bedford it was a saturday night in december much was i disappointed upon 
learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of 
reaching that place would offer till the following monday as most young candidates for the 
pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on 
their voyage it may as well be related that i for one had no idea 
of so doing for my mind was made up to sail in no other than 
a nantucket craft because there was a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that 
famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has of late been 
gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is 
now much behind her yet nantucket was her great tyre of this carthage place where 
the first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal 
whalemen the red men first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan 
and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly 
laden with imported goes the throw at the whales in order to discover when they 
were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a 
day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark 
for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat 
and sleep meanwhile it was a very dubious looking nay a very dark and dismal 
night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels 
i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silver wherever 
you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of a 
dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness 
towards the in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear 
ishmael be sure to inquire the price and be too particular with halting steps i 
paced the streets and passed the sign of crossed it looked too expensive and jolly 
there further on from the bright red windows of the fish inn there came such 
fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before 
the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard 
asphaltic pavement weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projections because 
from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight 
too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare 
in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within but go on 
ishmael said i at last you hear get away from before the door your patched 
boots are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the 
streets that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest 
inns such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and 
there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of 
the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved 
all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low 
wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look as 
if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the first thing 
i did was to stumble over an ash box in the porch ha thought i 
ha as the flying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city 
gomorrah but crossed harpoons and sword fish then must needs be the sign of trap 
however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened 
a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred 
black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of 
doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the 
text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth gnashing 
there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of trap moving 
on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the 
docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging 
sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight 
jet of misty spray and these words spouter inn coffin coffin ominous in that particular 
connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i 
suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim 
and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house 
itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some 
burnt district and as the swinging sign had a poverty stricken sort of creak to 
it i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best 
of pea coffee it was a queer sort of gable ended old house one side 
palsied as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner 
where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about 
poor tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in doors 
with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed judging of that tempestuous wind 
called euroclydon says an old whose works i possess the only copy maketh a marvellous 
difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is 
all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the 
frost is on both sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier 
true enough thought i as this passage occurred to my black letter thou reasonest well 
yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house what a 
pity they stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little 
lint here and there but too late to make any improvements now the universe is 
finished the copestone is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago 
poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off 
his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put 
a corn cob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous 
euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his red silken he had a redder one afterwards 
pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them 
talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilege of making 
my own summer with my own coals but what thinks lazarus can he warm his 
blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather 
be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along 
the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself 
in order to keep out this frost now that lazarus should lie stranded there on 
the curbstone before the door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg 
should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like 
a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of 
a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans but no more of 
this blubbering now we are going a whaling and there is plenty of that yet 
to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort 
of a place this may be chapter 3 the spouter inn entering that gable ended 
spouter inn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with old fashioned wainscots 
reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a 
very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights 
by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of 
systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way 
arrive at an understanding of its purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that 
at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new 
england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest 
contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the 
back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea 
however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you was 
a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture 
over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy 
picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet was there a sort of 
indefinite half attained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you 
involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever 
and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you through the black sea 
in a midnight gale the unnatural combat of the four primal elements a blasted heath 
a hyperborean winter scene the breaking up of the icebound stream of time but at 
last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the midst that once 
found out and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a 
faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself in fact the design 
seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of 
many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a cape 
horner in a great hurricane the half foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled 
masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is 
in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast heads the opposite wall 
of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and 
spears some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with 
knots of human hair and one was sickle shaped with a vast handle sweeping round 
like the segment made in the new mown grass by a long armed mower you 
shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone 
a death harvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old 
whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once 
long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between 
a sunrise and a sunset and that like a corkscrew flung in javan seas and 
run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the 
original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body 
of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the 
hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low arched through what in old 
times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all enter the public room 
a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old 
wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old cockpits especially of 
such a howling night when this corner anchored old ark rocked so furiously on one 
side stood a long low shelf like table covered with cracked glass cases filled with 
dusty rarities gathered from this wide remotest nooks projecting from the further angle of the 
room stands a dark looking rude attempt at a right head be that how it 
may there stands the vast arched bone of the jaw so wide a coach might 
almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters bottles flasks 
and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed 
they called him bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells 
the sailors deliriums and death abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison 
though true cylinders the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom 
parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these goblets fill to this mark and 
your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to 
the full cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering 
the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by 
a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i 
desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house was a 
bed unoccupied avast he added tapping his forehead haint no objections to sharing a blanket 
have ye i you are a so better get used to that sort of thing 
i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if 
i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and 
that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer 
was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so 
bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent blanket thought 
so all right take a seat supper want supper be ready directly i sat down 
on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at 
one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack knife stooping 
over and diligently working away at the space between his legs he was trying his 
hand at a ship under full sail but he make much headway i thought at 
last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining 
room it was cold as fire at landlord said he afford it nothing but two 
dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our 
monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen 
fingers but the fare was of the most substantial only meat and potatoes but dumplings 
good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself 
to these dumplings in a most direful manner boy said the landlord have the nightmare 
to a dead sartainty i whispered aint the harpooneer is it no said he looking 
a sort of diabolically funny harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings 
he eats nothing but steaks and he likes rare devil he does says i is 
that harpooneer is he here be here afore long was the answer i could not 
help it but i began to feel suspicious of this harpooneer at any rate i 
made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together 
he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went 
back to the bar room when knowing not what else to do with myself i 
resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on presently a rioting 
noise was heard without starting up the landlord cried the crew i seed her reported 
in the offing this morning a three voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now 
have the latest news from the feegees a tramping of sea boots was heard in 
the entry the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners 
enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters 
all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an eruption of 
bears from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this was the first 
house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the the 
wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained 
of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitch like 
potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds 
and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast 
of labrador or on the weather side of an ice island the liquor soon mounted 
into their heads as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from 
sea and they began capering about most obstreperously i observed however that one of them 
held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his 
shipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as 
much noise as the rest this man interested me at once and since the sea 
gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleeping partner 
one so far as this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little 
description of him he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a 
chest like a coffer dam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his 
face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while 
in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to 
give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner and 
from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from 
the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its 
height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he 
became my comrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by 
his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they 
raised a cry of bulkington bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of 
him it was now about nine and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these 
orgies i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me 
just previous to the entrance of the seamen no man prefers to sleep two in 
a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own 
brother i know how it is but people like to be private when they are 
sleeping and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn 
in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely multiply nor 
was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a 
bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at 
sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one 
apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and 
sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i 
abominated the thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a 
harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the 
tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it was 
getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now 
he should tumble in upon me at could i tell from what vile hole he 
had been coming changed my mind about that harpooneer sleep with him try the bench 
here as you please sorry i spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and a 
plaguy rough board of the knots and notches wait a bit skrimshander got a plane 
there in the i say and make ye snug enough so saying he procured the 
plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing 
away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shavings flew right and 
left till at last the plane iron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord 
was near spraining his wrist and i told him for sake to bed was soft 
enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the 
world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shavings with 
another grin and throwing them into the great stove in
