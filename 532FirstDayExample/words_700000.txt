driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about 
the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find 
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i 
meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it 
requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and 
methodically knocking hats i account it high time to get to sea as soon as 
i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato

in this if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time 
or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me there now 
is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharves as indian isles by 
coral surrounds it with her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its 
extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled 
by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land look at 
the crowds of water gazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go 
from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you 
see like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men 
fixed in ocean reveries some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pier heads 
some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the rigging 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsmen 
of week days pent up in lath and to counters nailed to benches clinched to 
desks how then is this are the green fields gone what do they here but 
look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a 
dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under 
the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice no they must get just as 
nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in and there they of inlanders 
all they come from lanes and alleys streets and east south and west yet here 
they all unite tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses 
of all those ships attract them thither once more say you are in the country 
in some high land of lakes take almost any path you please and ten to

your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes as every one knows 
meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desires to 
paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the 
valley of the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees 
each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and 
here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes 
a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs 
of mountains bathed in their hill side blue but though the picture lies thus tranced 
and though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this head yet 
all were vain unless the eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go 
visit the prairies in june when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee 
deep among tiger is the one charm wanting is not a drop of water there 
were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see 
it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver 
deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money 
in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with 
a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to 
sea why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a 
mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight 
of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks 
give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not 
without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he 
could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it 
and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans 
it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key 
to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going 
to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be 
over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i 
ever go to sea as a passenger for to go as a passenger you must 
needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something 
in it besides passengers get sea sleep of not enjoy themselves much as a general 
thing i never go as a passenger nor though i am something of a salt 
do i ever go to sea as a commodore or a captain or a cook 
i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them for 
my part i abominate all honorable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever 
it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself without 
taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not and as for going as 
cook i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of 
officer on ship somehow i never fancied broiling fowls once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically 
salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say 
reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings 
of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the 
mummies of those creatures in their huge bake houses the pyramids no when i go 
to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into 
the forecastle aloft there to the royal mast head true they rather order me about 
some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may 
meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touches sense of 
honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van 
rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your 
hand into the tar pot you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster making 
the tallest boys stand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i 
assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca 
and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears 
off in time what of it if some old hunks of a sea captain orders 
me to get a broom and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount 
to weighed i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the 
archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that 
old hunks in that particular instance who a slave tell me that well then however 
the old sea captains may order me they may thump and punch me about i 
have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one 
way or other served in much the same in a physical or metaphysical point of 
view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hands should 
rub each shoulder blades and be content again i always go to sea as a 
sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never 
pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves 
must pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being 
paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard 
thieves entailed upon us but being paid will compare with it the urbane activity with 
which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money 
to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a 
monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always 
go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of 
the fore castle deck for as in this world head winds are far more prevalent 
than winds from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for 
the most part the commodore on the quarter deck gets his atmosphere at second hand 
from the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not so 
in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things 
at the same time that the leaders little suspect it but wherefore it was that 
after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor i should now take it 
into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of 
the fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences 
me in some unaccountable can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going 
on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that was drawn 
up a long time ago it came in as a sort of brief interlude and 
solo between more extensive performances i take it that this part of the bill must 
have run something like this grand contested election for the presidency of the united states 
voyage by one ishmael battle in affghanistan though i cannot tell why it was exactly 
that those stage managers the fates put me down for this shabby part of a 
whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short 
and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in i cannot tell why this 
was exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstances i think i can see 
a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various 
disguises induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into 
the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating 
judgment chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such 
a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity then the wild and distant seas 
where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with 
all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me 
to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not have been inducements but 
as for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote i love 
to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i 
am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with they let it 
is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place 
one lodges in by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the 
great flood gates of the wonder world swung open and in the wild conceits that 
swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless 
processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like 
a snow hill in the air chapter 2 the carpet bag i stuffed a shirt 
or two into my old carpet bag tucked it under my arm and started for 
cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived 
in new bedford it was a saturday night in december much was i disappointed upon 
learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of 
reaching that place would offer till the following monday as most young candidates for the 
pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on 
their voyage it may as well be related that i for one had no idea 
of so doing for my mind was made up to sail in no other than 
a nantucket craft because there was a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that 
famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has of late been 
gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is 
now much behind her yet nantucket was her great tyre of this carthage place where 
the first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal 
whalemen the red men first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan 
and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly 
laden with imported goes the throw at the whales in order to discover when they 
were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a 
day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark 
for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat 
and sleep meanwhile it was a very dubious looking nay a very dark and dismal 
night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels 
i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silver wherever 
you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of a 
dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness 
towards the in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear 
ishmael be sure to inquire the price and be too particular with halting steps i 
paced the streets and passed the sign of crossed it looked too expensive and jolly 
there further on from the bright red windows of the fish inn there came such 
fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before 
the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard 
asphaltic pavement weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projections because 
from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight 
too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare 
in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within but go on 
ishmael said i at last you hear get away from before the door your patched 
boots are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the 
streets that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest 
inns such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and 
there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of 
the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved 
all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low 
wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look as 
if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the first thing 
i did was to stumble over an ash box in the porch ha thought i 
ha as the flying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city 
gomorrah but crossed harpoons and sword fish then must needs be the sign of trap 
however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened 
a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred 
black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of 
doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the 
text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth gnashing 
there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of trap moving 
on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the 
docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging 
sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight 
jet of misty spray and these words spouter inn coffin coffin ominous in that particular 
connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i 
suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim 
and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house 
itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some 
burnt district and as the swinging sign had a poverty stricken sort of creak to 
it i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best 
of pea coffee it was a queer sort of gable ended old house one side 
palsied as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner 
where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about 
poor tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in doors 
with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed judging of that tempestuous wind 
called euroclydon says an old whose works i possess the only copy maketh a marvellous 
difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is 
all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the 
frost is on both sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier 
true enough thought i as this passage occurred to my black letter thou reasonest well 
yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house what a 
pity they stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little 
lint here and there but too late to make any improvements now the universe is 
finished the copestone is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago 
poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off 
his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put 
a corn cob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous 
euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his red silken he had a redder one afterwards 
pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them 
talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilege of making 
my own summer with my own coals but what thinks lazarus can he warm his 
blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather 
be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along 
the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself 
in order to keep out this frost now that lazarus should lie stranded there on 
the curbstone before the door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg 
should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like 
a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of 
a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans but no more of 
this blubbering now we are going a whaling and there is plenty of that yet 
to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort 
of a place this may be chapter 3 the spouter inn entering that gable ended 
spouter inn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with old fashioned wainscots 
reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a 
very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights 
by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of 
systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way 
arrive at an understanding of its purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that 
at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new 
england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest 
contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the 
back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea 
however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you was 
a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture 
over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy 
picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet was there a sort of 
indefinite half attained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you 
involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever 
and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you through the black sea 
in a midnight gale the unnatural combat of the four primal elements a blasted heath 
a hyperborean winter scene the breaking up of the icebound stream of time but at 
last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the midst that once 
found out and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a 
faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself in fact the design 
seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of 
many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a cape 
horner in a great hurricane the half foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled 
masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is 
in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast heads the opposite wall 
of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and 
spears some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with 
knots of human hair and one was sickle shaped with a vast handle sweeping round 
like the segment made in the new mown grass by a long armed mower you 
shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone 
a death harvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old 
whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once 
long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between 
a sunrise and a sunset and that like a corkscrew flung in javan seas and 
run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the 
original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body 
of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the 
hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low arched through what in old 
times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all enter the public room 
a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old 
wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old cockpits especially of 
such a howling night when this corner anchored old ark rocked so furiously on one 
side stood a long low shelf like table covered with cracked glass cases filled with 
dusty rarities gathered from this wide remotest nooks projecting from the further angle of the 
room stands a dark looking rude attempt at a right head be that how it 
may there stands the vast arched bone of the jaw so wide a coach might 
almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters bottles flasks 
and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed 
they called him bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells 
the sailors deliriums and death abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison 
though true cylinders the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom 
parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these goblets fill to this mark and 
your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to 
the full cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering 
the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by 
a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i 
desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house was a 
bed unoccupied avast he added tapping his forehead haint no objections to sharing a blanket 
have ye i you are a so better get used to that sort of thing 
i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if 
i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and 
that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer 
was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so 
bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent blanket thought 
so all right take a seat supper want supper be ready directly i sat down 
on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at 
one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack knife stooping 
over and diligently working away at the space between his legs he was trying his 
hand at a ship under full sail but he make much headway i thought at 
last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining 
room it was cold as fire at landlord said he afford it nothing but two 
dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our 
monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen 
fingers but the fare was of the most substantial only meat and potatoes but dumplings 
good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself 
to these dumplings in a most direful manner boy said the landlord have the nightmare 
to a dead sartainty i whispered aint the harpooneer is it no said he looking 
a sort of diabolically funny harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings 
he eats nothing but steaks and he likes rare devil he does says i is 
that harpooneer is he here be here afore long was the answer i could not 
help it but i began to feel suspicious of this harpooneer at any rate i 
made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together 
he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went 
back to the bar room when knowing not what else to do with myself i 
resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on presently a rioting 
noise was heard without starting up the landlord cried the crew i seed her reported 
in the offing this morning a three voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now 
have the latest news from the feegees a tramping of sea boots was heard in 
the entry the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners 
enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters 
all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an eruption of 
bears from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this was the first 
house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the the 
wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained 
of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitch like 
potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds 
and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast 
of labrador or on the weather side of an ice island the liquor soon mounted 
into their heads as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from 
sea and they began capering about most obstreperously i observed however that one of them 
held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his 
shipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as 
much noise as the rest this man interested me at once and since the sea 
gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleeping partner 
one so far as this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little 
description of him he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a 
chest like a coffer dam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his 
face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while 
in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to 
give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner and 
from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from 
the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its 
height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he 
became my comrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by 
his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they 
raised a cry of bulkington bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of 
him it was now about nine and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these 
orgies i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me 
just previous to the entrance of the seamen no man prefers to sleep two in 
a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own 
brother i know how it is but people like to be private when they are 
sleeping and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn 
in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely multiply nor 
was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a 
bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at 
sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one 
apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and 
sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i 
abominated the thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a 
harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the 
tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it was 
getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now 
he should tumble in upon me at could i tell from what vile hole he 
had been coming changed my mind about that harpooneer sleep with him try the bench 
here as you please sorry i spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and a 
plaguy rough board of the knots and notches wait a bit skrimshander got a plane 
there in the i say and make ye snug enough so saying he procured the 
plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing 
away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shavings flew right and 
left till at last the plane iron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord 
was near spraining his wrist and i told him for sake to bed was soft 
enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the 
world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shavings with 
another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room 
he went about his business and left me in a brown study i now took 
the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but 
that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too narrow and 
the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed there 
was no yoking them i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear 
space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down 
in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over 
me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at 
all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window 
and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the 
spot where i had thought to spend the night the devil fetch that harpooneer thought 
i but stop i steal a march on his door inside and jump into his 
bed not to be wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea 
but upon second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next 
morning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing 
in the entry all ready to knock me down still looking round me again and 
seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other bed i 
began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown 
harpooneer thinks i wait awhile he must be dropping in before long have a good 
look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after no telling 
but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going 
to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer said i sort of a chap is 
he always keep such late hours it was now hard upon twelve the landlord chuckled 
again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my 
comprehension he answered an early to bed and airley to the bird what catches the 
worm but to night he went out a peddling you see and i see what 
on airth keeps him so late unless may be he sell his head sell his 
head sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a 
towering rage you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed 
saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town precisely it 
said the landlord i told him he sell it here the overstocked what shouted i 
heads to be sure there too many heads in the world tell you what it 
is landlord said i quite calmly better stop spinning that yarn to not green be 
not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick i rayther guess be done brown 
if that ere harpooneer hears you a his head break it for him said i 
now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the broke said he 
said broke do you mean and the very reason he sell it i guess said 
i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a snow stop whittling 
you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to 
your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half 
a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer 
whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and 
exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you 
design for my sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in 
the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who 
and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to 
spend the night with him and in the first place you will be so good 
as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to 
be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and no idea of sleeping with 
a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induce 
me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution said 
the landlord fetching a long breath a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips 
a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have 
been you of has just arrived from the south seas where he bought up a 
lot of new zealand heads great curios you know and sold all on but one 
and that one trying to sell to night cause to sunday and it would not 
do to be human heads about the streets when folks is to churches he wanted 
to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was out of the door 
with four heads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of 
inions this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after 
all had had no idea of fooling at the same time what could i think 
of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath 
engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators upon it 
landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man pays was the rejoinder come getting dreadful late 
you had better be turning a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere 
bed the night we were spliced plenty of room for two to kick about in 
that bed an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used 
to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got 
a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor 
and came near breaking his arm arter that sal said it do come along here 
give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and 
held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking 
at a clock in the corner he exclaimed vum see that harpooneer to night come 
to anchor along then do come ye come i considered the matter a moment and 
then up stairs we went and i was ushered into a small room cold as 
a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for 
any four harpooneers to sleep abreast said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy 
old sea chest that did double duty as a wash stand and centre table make 
yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed 
but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none 
of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round 
the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging 
to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing 
a man striking a whale of things not properly belonging to the room there was 
a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large 
bag containing the wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there was 
a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire place and 
a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed but what is this on 
the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt 
it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion 
concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at 
the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian 
moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as you 
see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible that any sober 
harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the streets of any christian town 
in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed 
me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little 
damp as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i 
went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i 
never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in 
such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck i sat down 
on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this head peddling harpooneer and 
his door mat after thinking some time on the bed side i got up and 
took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking 
i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves 
but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as i was and remembering what 
the landlord said about the not coming home at all that night it being so 
very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots 
and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care 
of heaven whether that mattress was stuffed with corn cobs or broken crockery there is 
no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a 
long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly 
made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall 
in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under 
the door lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal head 
peddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken 
to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the 
other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle 
a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began 
working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as 
being in the room i was all eagerness to see his face but he kept 
it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the mouth this accomplished however he 
turned good heavens what a sight such a face it was of a dark purplish 
yellow colour here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares yes just as 
i thought a terrible bedfellow been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he 
is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face 
so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be sticking plasters at 
all those black squares on his cheeks they were stains of some sort or other 
at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of 
the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white whaleman falling among 
the cannibals had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course 
of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it 
thought i after all only his outside a man can be honest in any sort 
of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it 
i mean lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing to be 
sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never 
heard of a hot tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i 
had never been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary 
effects upon the skin now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning 
this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty having opened his bag 
he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a 
seal skin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the 
middle of the room he then took the new zealand ghastly thing crammed it down 
into the bag he now took off his new beaver i came nigh singing out 
with fresh surprise there was no hair on his to speak of at but a 
small scalp knot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for 
all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and 
the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a 
dinner even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but 
it was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of 
this head peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear 
and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as 
much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken 
into my room at the dead of night in fact i was so afraid of 
him that i was not game enough just then to address him and demand a 
satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile he continued the business of undressing 
and at last showed his chest and arms as i live these covered parts of 
him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all 
over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty war and 
just escaped from it with a sticking plaster shirt still more his very legs were 
marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of 
young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or 
other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas and so landed in this 
christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of heads the heads of 
his own brothers he might take a fancy to look at that tomahawk but there 
was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated 
my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his 
heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he 
fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a 
hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three old congo baby remembering 
the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real 
baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it was not at all limber 
and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must 
be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the 
savage goes up to the empty fire place and removing the papered fire board sets 
up this little hunch backed image like a tenpin between the andirons the chimney jambs 
and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this fire place 
made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol i now screwed 
my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease see what 
was next to follow first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of 
his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of 
ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings 
into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the fire and still hastier 
withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last 
succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little 
he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil 
did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved 
his lips all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the 
devotee who seemed to be praying in a sing song or else singing some pagan 
psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at 
last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again 
in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead 
woodcock all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms 
of concluding his business operations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was 
high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell 
in which i had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating 
what to say was a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he 
examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light 
with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the 
next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang 
into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving 
a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me stammering out something i knew not 
what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or 
whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the 
lamp again but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended 
my meaning e debel you at last no speak e dam me i kill e 
and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark for sake 
peter coffin shouted i watch coffin angels save me e tell ee me who ee 
be or dam me i kill e again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings 
of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen 
would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the 
room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him be 
afraid now said he grinning again here harm a hair of your head your grinning 
shouted i why you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal thought ye 
it i tell ye he was a heads around town turn flukes again and go 
to sleep queequeg look sabbee me i this man sleepe sabbee sabbee queequeg puffing away 
at his pipe and sitting up in bed gettee in he added motioning to me 
with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in 
not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at 
him a moment for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely 
looking cannibal all this fuss i have been making about thought i to a human 
being just as i am he has just as much reason to fear me as 
i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a 
drunken christian said i him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you 
call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with 
him but i fancy having a man smoking in bed with me dangerous besides i 
insured this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely motioned me 
to get into over to one side as much as to touch a leg of 
ye night landlord said i may go i turned in and never slept better in 
my life chapter 4 the counterpane upon waking next morning about daylight i found arm 
thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost thought i 
had been his wife the counterpane was of patchwork full of odd little parti coloured 
squares and triangles and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan 
labyrinth of a figure no two parts of which were of one precise i suppose 
to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeves 
irregularly rolled up at various same arm of his i say looked for all the 
world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it as 
the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt 
they so blended their hues together and it was only by the sense of weight 
and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me my sensations were strange 
let me try to explain them when i was a child i well remember a 
somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream i 
never could entirely settle the circumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper 
or think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a 
little sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other was 
all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless mother dragged me by 
the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it was 
only two in the afternoon of the 21st june the longest day in the year 
in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there was no help for it so up 
stairs i went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself as slowly 
as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the 
sheets i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could 
hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the small of my back ached to 
think of it and it was so light too the sun shining in at the 
window and a great rattling of coaches in the streets and the sound of gay 
voices all over the house i felt worse and last i got up dressed and 
softly going down in my stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself 
at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering 
for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length 
of time but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers and back i 
had to go to my room for several hours i lay there broad awake feeling 
a great deal worse than i have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent 
misfortunes at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and 
slowly waking from steeped in opened my eyes and the before sun lit room was 
now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame 
nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand 
seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent 
form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bed side 
for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with the most awful 
fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could 
but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not 
how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i 
shudderingly remembered it all and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself 
in confounding attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle 
myself with it now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the 
supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced 
on waking up and seeing pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the 
past events soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only 
alive to the comical predicament for though i tried to move his his bridegroom sleeping 
as he was he still hugged me tightly as though naught but death should part 
us twain i now strove to rouse his only answer was a snore i then 
rolled over my neck feeling as if it were in a horse collar and suddenly 
felt a slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the 
side as if it were a hatchet faced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i 
abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a 
tomahawk the name of goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and 
loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that 
matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back 
his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and 
sat up in bed stiff as a pike staff looking at me and rubbing his 
eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though 
a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him meanwhile i 
lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings now and bent upon narrowly observing so 
curious a creature when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of 
his bedfellow and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out 
upon the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if 
it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving 
the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequeg under the circumstances this is a very 
civilized overture but the truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say 
what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this particular 
compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i 
was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his 
toilette motions for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a 
man like queequeg you see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual 
regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one 
by the by and minus his hunted up his boots what under the heavens he 
did it for i cannot tell but his next movement was to crush in hand 
and hat the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred he was 
hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard 
of is any man required to be private when putting on his boots but queequeg 
do you see was a creature in the transition caterpillar nor butterfly he was just 
enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners his education was 
not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree 
civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all but then 
if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting 
under the bed to put them on at last he emerged with his hat very 
much dented and crushed down over his eyes and began creaking and limping about the 
room as if not being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide 
not made to order pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a 
bitter cold morning seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that 
the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room 
and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made staving about with little 
else but his hat and boots on i begged him as well as i could 
to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as 
possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the morning 
any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with 
restricting his ablutions to his chest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and 
taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash stand centre table dipped it 
into water and commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept 
his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner slips 
out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot 
and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorous scraping 
or rather harpooning of his cheeks thinks i queequeg this is using best cutlery with 
a vengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know 
of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp 
the long straight edges are always kept the rest of his toilet was soon achieved 
and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey 
jacket and sporting his harpoon like a baton chapter 5 breakfast i quickly followed suit 
and descending into the bar room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no 
malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the 
matter of my bedfellow however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather 
too scarce a good thing the the pity so if any one man in his 
own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be 
backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way 
and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more 
in that man than you perhaps think for the bar room was now full of 
the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous and whom i had not 
as yet had a good look at they were nearly all whalemen chief mates and 
second mates and third mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and 
harpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an unshorn shaggy 
set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns you could pretty plainly tell how long 
each one had been ashore this young healthy cheek is like a sun toasted pear 
in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three 
days landed from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shades lighter 
you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the complexion of 
a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless has tarried 
whole weeks ashore but who could show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various 
tints seemed like the western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates zone 
by zone ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went 
to breakfast they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at 
ease in manner quite self possessed in company not always though ledyard the great new 
england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least 
assurance in the parlor but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn 
by dogs as ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty 
stomach in the negro heart of africa which was the sum of poor kind of 
travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social 
polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere 
these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated 
at the table and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling to 
my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence and not only that 
but they looked embarrassed yes here were a set of sea dogs many of whom 
without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high strangers to duelled them 
dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast of the same 
calling all of kindred round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never 
been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains a curious sight these 
bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen but as for queequeg sat there among the head 
of the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure 
i cannot say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified 
his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching 
over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the 
beefsteaks towards him but that was certainly very coolly done by him and every one 
knows that in most estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly we 
will not speak of all peculiarities here how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls and 
applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks done rare enough that when breakfast was over he 
withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawk pipe and was sitting 
there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i sallied out for 
a stroll chapter 6 the street if i had been astonished at first catching a 
glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a 
civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets 
of new bedford in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequently offer to 
view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean 
mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies regent street is not unknown to lascars and 
malays and at bombay in the apollo green live yankees have often scared the natives 
but new bedford beats all water street and wapping in these last mentioned haunts you 
see only sailors but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners savages 
outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh it makes a stranger 
stare but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimens 
of the whaling craft which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights 
still more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town scores of green 
vermonters and new hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery they 
are mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests and now seek to 
drop the axe and snatch the whale lance many are as green as the green 
mountains whence they came in some things you would think them but a few hours 
old look there that chap strutting round the corner he wears a beaver hat and 
swallow tailed coat girdled with a sailor belt and sheath knife here comes another with 
a wester and a bombazine cloak no town bred dandy will compare with a country 
bred mean a downright bumpkin fellow that in the dog days will mow his two 
acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands now when a country dandy 
like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the 
great whale fishery you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport 
in bespeaking his sea outfit he orders bell buttons to his waistcoats straps to his 
canvas trowsers ah poor hay seed how bitterly will burst those straps in the first 
howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and all down the throat of the 
tempest but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and bumpkins to 
show her visitors not at all still new bedford is a queer place had it 
not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been 
in as howling condition as the coast of labrador as it is parts of her 
back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony the town itself is 
perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england it is a land 
of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn and wine 
the streets do not run with milk nor in the spring time do they pave 
them with fresh eggs yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will you 
find more patrician like houses parks and gardens more opulent than in new bedford whence 
came they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country go and gaze 
upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion and your question will be answered 
yes all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic pacific and indian 
oceans one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of 
the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that in new bedford fathers they 
say give whales for dowers to their daughters and portion off their nieces with a 
few porpoises a piece you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding 
for they say they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly 
burn their lengths in spermaceti candles in summer time the town is sweet to see 
full of fine avenues of green and gold and in august high in air the 
beautiful and bountiful horse chestnuts candelabra wise proffer the passer by their tapering upright cones 
of congregated blossoms so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford 
has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at final 
day and the women of new bedford they bloom like their own red roses but 
roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as 
sunlight in the seventh heavens elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye cannot save in 
salem where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell 
them miles off shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of 
the puritanic sands chapter 7 the chapel in this same new bedford there stands a 
chapel and few are the moody fishermen shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific 
who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i 
did not returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this special 
errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist wrapping 
myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my way against 
the stubborn storm entering i found a small scattered congregation of sailors and wives and 
widows a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm 
each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other as if each silent grief 
were insular and incommunicable the chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands 
of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders masoned into 
the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran something like the following 
but i do not pretend to quote sacred to the memory of john talbot who 
at the age of eighteen was lost overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia 
november 1 st 1836 this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister sacred 
to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman walter canny seth macy and 
samuel gleig forming one of the crews of the ship eliza who were towed out 
of sight by a whale on the off shore ground in the pacific december 31 
st 1839 this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates sacred to the memory 
of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bows of his boat was killed 
by a sperm whale on the coast of japan august 3 d 1833 this tablet 
is erected to his memory by his widow shaking off the sleet from my ice 
glazed hat and jacket i seated myself near the door and turning sideways was surprised 
to see queequeg near me affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a 
wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage was the only person present 
who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only one who could not 
read and therefore was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall whether any of 
the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation i 
knew not but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly 
did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief 
that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose unhealing hearts 
the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh oh 
ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flowers can here 
lies my beloved ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these what 
bitter blanks in those black bordered marbles which cover no ashes what despair in those 
immovable inscriptions what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw 
upon all faith and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a 
grave as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here in 
what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included why it is that 
a universal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though containing more secrets 
than the goodwin sands how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for 
the other world we prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not 
thus entitle him if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth 
why the life insurance companies pay death forfeitures upon immortals in what eternal unstirring paralysis 
and deadly hopeless trance yet lies antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago how 
it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain 
are dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all the 
dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole 
city all these things are not without their meanings but faith like a jackal feeds 
among the tombs and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope 
it needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a nantucket 
voyage i regarded those marble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened doleful 
day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me yes ishmael the 
same fate may be thine but somehow i grew merry again delightful inducements to embark 
fine chance for promotion it a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet 
yes there is death in this business of speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man 
into eternity but what then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and 
death methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance 
methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the 
sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air methinks my 
body is but the lees of my better being in fact take my body who 
will take it i say it is not me and therefore three cheers for nantucket 
and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul 
jove himself cannot chapter 8 the pulpit i had not been seated very long ere 
a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately as the storm pelted door flew 
back upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently 
attested that this fine old man was the chaplain yes it was the famous father 
mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favourite he 
had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth but for many years past 
had dedicated his life to the ministry at the time i now write of father 
mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old 
age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of 
his wrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing spring verdure peeping forth 
even beneath snow no one having previously heard his history could for the first time 
behold father mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about 
him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed 
that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his 
tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost 
to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed 
however hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up in 
a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly 
approached the pulpit like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and 
since a regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the 
floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect it seemed had 
acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the pulpit without a stairs substituting 
a perpendicular side ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at 
sea the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair 
of red worsted man ropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained 
with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed 
by no means in bad taste halting for an instant at the foot of the 
ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man ropes father mapple 
cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailor like but still reverential dexterity 
hand over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the main top of his vessel 
the perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with swinging ones 
were of cloth covered rope only the rounds were of wood so that at every 
step there was a joint at my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not 
escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joints in the present instance seemed 
unnecessary for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly 
turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step 
till the whole was deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little quebec i pondered 
some time without fully comprehending the reason for this father mapple enjoyed such a wide 
reputation for sincerity and sanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by 
any mere tricks of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason 
for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be then that by 
that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all 
outward worldly ties and connexions yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the 
word to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a self containing 
lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls but the side ladder 
was not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the former sea farings 
between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its 
back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible 
storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers but high above the 
flying scud and dark rolling clouds there floated a little isle of sunlight from which 
beamed forth an face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon 
the tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the plank where nelson 
fell noble ship the angel seemed to say on beat on thou noble ship and 
bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling 
azure is at hand nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same 
sea taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in 
the likeness of a bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece 
of scroll work fashioned after a fiddle headed beak what could be more full of 
meaning the pulpit is ever this foremost part all the rest comes in its rear 
the pulpit leads the world from thence it is the storm of quick wrath is 
first descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is the 
god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds yes the a 
ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is its 
prow chapter 9 the sermon father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming 
authority ordered the scattered people to condense gangway there side away to gangway to starboard 
midships midships there was a low rumbling of heavy sea boots among the benches and 
a still slighter shuffling of shoes and all was quiet again and every eye on 
the preacher he paused a little then kneeling in the bows folded his large brown 
hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered a prayer so deeply devout 
that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea this ended in 
prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is 
foundering at sea in a such tones he commenced reading the following hymn but changing 
his manner towards the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and ribs and 
terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all sun lit waves 
rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom saw the opening maw of hell 
with endless pains and sorrows there which none but they that feel can oh i 
was plunging to despair black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe 
him mine he bowed his ear to my no more the whale did me confine 
speed he flew to my relief as on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright 
as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god song for ever shall record that 
terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy 
and the power nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the 
howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaves 
of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said 
shipmates clinch the last verse of the first chapter of god had prepared a great 
fish to swallow up jonah this book containing only four one of the smallest strands 
in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what depths of the soul does deep 
sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing 
is that canticle in the belly how billow like and boisterously grand we feel the 
floods surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters 
sea weed and all the slime of the sea is about us but what is 
this lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a two stranded lesson 
a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a 
pilot of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all 
because it is a story of the sin hard heartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift 
punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah as with all sinners 
among men the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of 
the command of mind now what that command was or how he found a hard 
command but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us 
to hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade and if we obey god 
we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of 
obeying god consists this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at god 
by seeking to flee from him he thinks that a ship made by men will 
carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains of this 
earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship bound for tarshish 
there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been 
no other city than the modern cadiz the opinion of learned men and where is 
cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa as jonah could 
possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea 
because joppa the modern jaffa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean 
the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from 
that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye not then shipmates that jonah sought 
to flee world wide from god miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all 
scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the shipping 
like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered self condemning is his 
look that had there been policemen in those days jonah on the mere suspicion of 
something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly a fugitive no 
baggage not a hat box valise or carpet bag friends accompany him to the wharf 
with their adieux at last after much dodging search he finds the tarshish ship receiving 
the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its 
captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the 
goods to mark the evil eye jonah sees this but in vain he tries to 
look all ease and confidence in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the 
man assure the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious 
way one whispers to the robbed a widow or do you mark him a bigamist 
or lad i guess the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one 
of the missing murderers from sodom another runs to read the bill stuck against the 
spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coins 
for the apprehension of a parricide and containing a description of his person he reads 
and looks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round 
jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah trembles and summoning all his 
boldness to his face only looks so much the more a coward he will not 
confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion so he makes the best of 
it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised 
they let him pass and he descends into the cabin there cries the captain at 
his busy desk hurriedly making out his papers for the there oh how that harmless 
question mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again but he rallies 
seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir thus far 
the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stands before 
him but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing 
glance sail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing 
him sooner sir enough for any honest man that goes a passenger ha jonah another 
stab but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent sail with ye says 
passage money how much is that pay now for it is particularly written shipmates as 
if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history he paid the 
fare ere the craft did sail and taken with the context this is full of 
meaning captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime in any but whose cupidity exposes 
it only in the penniless in this world shipmates sin that pays its way can 
travel freely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all 
frontiers so captain prepares to test the length of purse ere he judge him openly 
he charges him thrice the usual sum and assented to then the captain knows that 
jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that 
paves its rear with gold yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions 
still molest the captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger 
any way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage out my state 
room sir says jonah now travel weary i need sleep lookest like it says the 
captain thy room jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no 
key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something 
about the doors of cells being never allowed to be locked within all dressed and 
dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little state 
room ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasps then 
in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the water line jonah feels the heralding presentiment 
of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his 
wards at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in room and 
the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received 
the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with 
reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the 
false lying levels among which it hung the lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying 
in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successful 
fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more 
and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry so 
my conscience hangs in me he groans upwards so it burns but the chambers of 
my soul are all in crookedness one who after a night of drunken revelry hies 
to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of 
the roman race horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him 
as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish praying 
god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of 
woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the man who bleeds 
to death for conscience is the wound and naught to staunch it so after sore 
wrestlings in his berth prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep now 
the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and from the 
deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening glides to sea that ship my 
friends was the first of recorded smugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels 
he will not bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is 
like to break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when 
boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men 
are yelling and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over head in all this 
raging tumult jonah sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea 
feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush 
of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after 
him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the berth in the 
cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the frightened master comes 
to him and shrieks in his dead ear meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from 
his lethargy by that direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the 
deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he 
is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave after wave thus 
leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till 
the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat and ever as the white moon 
shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees 
the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep 
upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his cringing attitudes the god fugitive 
is now too plainly known the sailors mark him more and more certain grow their 
suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole 
matter to high heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this 
great tempest was upon them the lot is that discovered then how furiously they mob 
him with their questions is thine occupation whence comest thou thy country what people but 
mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor jonah the eager mariners but ask him 
who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those 
questions but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited 
answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him 
am a hebrew he fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the 
sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well mightest thou fear the 
lord god then straightway he now goes on to make a full confession whereupon the 
mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet 
supplicating god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts 
wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the 
sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them they 
mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship but all 
in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raised invokingly to god 
with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah now behold jonah taken up 
as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness floats out 
from the east and the sea is still as jonah carries down the gale with 
him leaving smooth water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a 
masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning 
jaws awaiting him and the whale shoots to all his ivory teeth like so many 
white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the belly 
but observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah 
does not weep and wail for direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is 
just he leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of 
all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy temple and here 
shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and 
how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance 
of him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before 
you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as 
a model for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of 
it like jonah while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting 
storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing sea storm 
seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved as with a ground swell 
his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away 
from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his 
simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them there 
now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves of 
the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eyes for the moment 
seemed communing with god and himself but again he leaned over towards the people and 
bowing his head lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake 
these words god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press upon 
me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that 
jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for 
i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down 
from this mast head and sit on the hatches there where you sit and listen 
as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more awful 
lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god how being 
an anointed pilot prophet or speaker of true things and bidden by the lord to 
sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the 
hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and 
his god by taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached 
as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down 
to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along the midst of 
the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and weeds were 
wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet 
even then beyond the reach of any of the belly of the whale grounded upon 
the utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried then 
god spake unto the fish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea 
the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights 
of air and earth and out jonah upon the dry land when the word of 
the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and ears like two sea shells 
still multitudinously murmuring of the did the bidding and what was that shipmates to preach 
the truth to the face of falsehood that was it shipmates this is that other 
lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it woe to 
him whom this world charms from gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour 
oil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale woe to him 
who seeks to please rather than to appal woe to him whose good name is 
more to him than goodness woe to him who in this world courts not dishonor 
woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation 
yea woe to him who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to 
others is himself a castaway he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment 
then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as 
he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm oh shipmates on the starboard hand of every 
woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the 
bottom of the woe is deep is not the main truck higher than the kelson 
is low delight is to far far upward and inward against the proud gods and 
commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to him 
whose strong arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has 
gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth 
and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the 
robes of senators and judges delight gallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law 
or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven delight 
is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the 
boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight 
and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his 
final father known to me by thy or immortal here i die i have striven 
to be thine more than to be this or mine own yet this is nothing 
i leave eternity to thee for what is man that he should live out the 
lifetime of his god he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his 
face with his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and 
he was left alone in the place chapter 10 a bosom friend returning to the 
spouter inn from the chapel i found queequeg there quite alone he having left the 
chapel before the benediction some time he was sitting on a bench before the fire 
with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up 
to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and 
with a jack knife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in 
his heathenish way but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon 
going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his 
lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth i a moment looking 
vacantly around him and giving utterance to a long drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he 
would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each 
time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was only by 
such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude 
of pages was excited with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was 
and hideously marred about the least to my countenance yet had a something in it 
which was by no means disagreeable you cannot hide the soul through all his unearthly 
tattooings i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his 
large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would 
dare a thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing about 
the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim he looked like a man 
who had never cringed and never had had a creditor whether it was too that 
his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and 
looked more expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but 
certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous but 
it reminded me of general head as seen in the popular busts of him it 
had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewise 
very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington cannibalistically 
developed whilst i was thus closely scanning him half pretending meanwhile to be looking out 
at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with 
so much as a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of 
the marvellous book considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and 
especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the 
morning i thought this indifference of his very strange but savages are strange beings at 
times you do not know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing 
their calm self collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed also that 
queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seamen in the 
inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle 
of his acquaintances all this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there 
was something almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand miles from 
home by the way of cape horn that was the only way he could get 
among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter and 
yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own 
companionship always equal to himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no 
doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that but perhaps to 
be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving 
so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out for 
a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have his digester 
as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that 
mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then only glows 
to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements and peering 
in upon us silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells i began 
to be sensible of strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my 
splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing savage had 
redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked 
no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits wild he was a very sight of sights to 
see yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things 
that would have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me 
try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy i 
drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing my best 
to talk with him meanwhile at first he little noticed these advances but presently upon 
my referring to his last hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were 
again to be bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps 
a little complimented we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain 
to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that 
were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to 
jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this 
famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he 
quietly offered me a puff and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe 
of his and keeping it regularly passing between us if there yet lurked any ice 
of indifference towards me in the breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed 
it out and left us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally 
and unbiddenly as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his 
forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married 
meaning in his phrase that we were bosom friends he would gladly die for me 
if need should be in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed 
far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those 
old rules would not apply after supper and another social chat and smoke we went 
to our room together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out 
his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollars in 
silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions 
pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine i was going to 
remonstrate but he silenced me by pouring them into my pockets i let them stay 
he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper 
fireboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed anxious for me to join 
him but well knowing what was to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case 
he invited me i would comply or otherwise i was a good christian born and 
bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church how then could i unite with 
this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i 
do you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and and all possibly 
be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worship do 
the will of that is worship and what is the will of god do to 
my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to that is 
the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish 
that this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular presbyterian 
form of worship consequently i must then unite with him in his ergo i must 
turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol offered 
him burnt biscuit with queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and 
that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences and 
all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat how 
it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential 
disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their 
souls to each other and some old couples often lie and chat over old times 
till nearly morning thus then in our honeymoon lay i and cosy loving pair chapter 
11 nightgown we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and 
queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine and then drawing 
them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by 
reason of our confabulations what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt 
like getting up again though day break was yet some way down the future yes 
we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome 
and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around 
us leaning against the head board with our four knees drawn up close together and 
our two noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warming pans we felt 
very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors 
indeed out of bed clothes too seeing that there was no fire in the room 
the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of 
you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not 
what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if you flatter yourself that 
you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot 
be said to be comfortable any more but if like queequeg and me in the 
bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled 
why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for 
this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one 
of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height of this sort of deliciousness 
is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold 
of the outer air then there you lie like the one warm spark in the 
heart of an arctic crystal we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some 
time when all at once i thought i would open my eyes for when between 
sheets whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a 
way of always keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness 
of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except 
his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences 
though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon opening my eyes then and 
coming out of my own pleasant and self created darkness into the imposed and coarse 
outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve at night i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did 
i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to 
strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a 
strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk be it said that 
though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the 
night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to 
bend them for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me 
even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then 
i no more felt unduly concerned for the policy of insurance i was only alive 
to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real 
friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed the tomahawk from 
one to the other till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of 
smoke illuminated by the flame of the new lit lamp whether it was that this 
undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes i know not but he 
now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him 
to go on and tell it he gladly complied though at the time i but 
ill comprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become 
more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such 
as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give chapter 12 biographical queequeg was 
a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and south it is 
not down in any map true places never are when a new hatched savage running 
wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as 
if he were a green sapling even then in ambitious soul lurked a strong desire 
to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his father was 
a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal side 
he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors there was excellent blood in 
his stuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his 
untutored youth a sag harbor ship visited his bay and queequeg sought a passage to 
christian lands but the ship having her full complement of seamen spurned his suit and 
not all the king his influence could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in 
his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must 
pass through when she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on 
the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into 
the water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its prow seaward he 
sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding 
by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of 
his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himself at 
full length upon the deck grappled a ring bolt there and swore not to let 
it go though hacked in pieces in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard 
suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and 
queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit christendom 
the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home but 
this fine young sea prince of wales never saw the cabin they put him down 
among the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to 
toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he 
might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen for at he told was 
actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to make 
his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they 
were but alas the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be 
both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his heathens arrived at last in 
old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on to 
nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also poor queequeg gave 
it up for lost thought he a wicked world in all meridians die a pagan 
and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians wore their 
clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer ways about him though now 
some time from home by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going 
back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone 
he being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet 
and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had unfitted him for ascending 
the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him but by and by 
he said he would return soon as he felt himself baptized again for the nonce 
however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans 
they had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of 
a sceptre now i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future 
movements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon this i 
told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to 
sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to 
embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the 
same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me 
in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldly dip 
into the potluck of both worlds to all this i joyously assented for besides the 
affection i now felt for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could 
not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant 
of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as known to merchant 
seamen his story being ended with his last dying puff queequeg embraced me pressed his 
forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this 
way and that and very soon were sleeping chapter 13 wheelbarrow next morning monday after 
disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block i settled my own 
and bill using however my money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed 
amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and as peter 
cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very 
person whom i now companied with we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including 
my own poor carpet bag and canvas sack and hammock away we went down to 
moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf as we were going along 
the people stared not at queequeg so they were used to seeing cannibals like him 
in their streets at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we heeded 
them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg now and then stopping 
to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked him why he carried such 
a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their 
own harpoons to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted was true 
enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of 
assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts 
of whales in short like many inland reapers and mowers who go into the meadows 
armed with their own in no wise obliged to furnish so queequeg for his own 
private reasons preferred his own harpoon shifting the barrow from my hand to his he 
told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was 
in sag harbor the owners of his ship it seems had lent him one in 
which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about 
the in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage 
the puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and 
marches up the wharf said i you might have known better than that one would 
think the people laugh upon this he told me another story the people of his 
island of rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young 
cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the 
great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held now a certain 
grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko and its all accounts a very stately punctilious 
gentleman at least for a sea commander was invited to the wedding feast of sister 
a pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding guests were 
assembled at the bamboo cottage this captain marches in and being assigned the post of 
honor placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty 
the king father grace being said those people have their grace as well as queequeg 
told me that unlike us who at such times look downwards to our platters they 
on the contrary copying the ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all i 
say being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the 
island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed 
beverage circulates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking captain 
of a having plain precedence over a mere island king especially in the own captain 
coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl it i suppose for a huge 
finger glass said queequeg you tink now our people laugh at last passage paid and 
luggage safe we stood on board the schooner hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet 
river on one side new bedford rose in terraces of streets their ice covered trees 
all glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of casks on casks 
were piled upon her wharves and side by side the world wandering whale ships lay 
silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenters and 
coopers with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch all betokening that 
new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only 
begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for 
ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly effort 
gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little moss tossed the 
quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings how i snuffed that 
tartar air i spurned that turnpike earth common highway all over dented with the marks 
of slavish heels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea 
which will permit no records at the same foam fountain queequeg seemed to drink and 
reel with me his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth 
on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the blast 
ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways leaning we sideways 
darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall masts buckling like indian canes 
in land tornadoes so full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by 
the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of 
the passengers a lubber like assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so 
companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro but 
there were some boobies and bumpkins there who by their intense greenness must have come 
from the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings 
mimicking him behind his back i thought the hour of doom was come dropping his 
harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity 
and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern 
in mid somerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning 
his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a 
puff capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer capting the devil you sir cried 
the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to queequeg in thunder do 
you mean by that you know you might have killed that chap him say said 
queequeg as he mildly turned to me say said i you came near kill e 
that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn e cried queequeg twisting his tattooed 
face into an unearthly expression of disdain him bevy small e fish e queequeg no 
kill e so small e fish e queequeg kill e big whale you roared the 
captain kill e you you cannibal if you try any more of your tricks aboard 
here so mind your eye but it so happened just then that it was high 
time for the captain to mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the main 
sail had parted the weather sheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side 
to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor fellow whom 
queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and 
to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness it flew from right 
to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant 
seemed on the point of snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable 
of being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom 
as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the midst of 
this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the 
boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then flinging 
the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his 
head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was 
safe the schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away 
the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long 
living arc of a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like 
a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing his 
brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but 
saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from 
the water queequeg now took an glance around him and seeming to see just how 
matters were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again one 
arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form the boat soon 
picked them up the poor bumpkin was restored all hands voted queequeg a noble trump 
the captain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle 
yea till poor queequeg took his last long dive was there ever such unconsciousness he 
did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane 
and magnanimous societies he only asked for to wipe the brine off that done he 
put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwarks and mildly eyeing 
those around him seemed to be saying to a mutual joint stock world in all 
meridians we cannibals must help these christians chapter 14 nantucket nothing more happened on the 
passage worthy the mentioning so after a fine run we safely arrived in nantucket nantucket 
take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of the 
world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely than the eddystone 
lighthouse look at mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background there 
is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for 
blotting paper some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there 
they grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have to send beyond seas 
for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood 
in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome that people 
there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summer time that 
one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a walk a prairie that 
they wear quicksand shoes something like laplander snow shoes that they are so shut up 
belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean 
that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as 
to the backs of sea turtles but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no 
illinois look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by 
the red men thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle swooped down upon 
the new england coast and carried off an infant indian in his talons with loud 
lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters they 
resolved to follow in the same direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous 
passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casket poor little 
skeleton what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take to the 
sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand grown bolder 
they waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boats and 
captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored 
this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in at straits 
and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass 
that has survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan salt sea mastodon 
clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panics are more to be 
dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults and thus have these naked nantucketers these 
sea hermits issuing from their ant hill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery 
world like so many alexanders parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and indian oceans 
as the three pirate powers did poland let america add mexico to texas and pile 
cuba upon canada let the english overswarm all india and hang out their blazing banner 
from the sun two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the for the sea is 
his he owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of 
way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts even 
pirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen the road they but plunder other 
ships other fragments of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from 
the bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the sea he 
alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it 
as his own special plantation there is his home there lies his business which a 
flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on 
the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs 
them as chamois hunters climb the alps for years he knows not the land so 
that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely 
than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull that at sunset folds 
her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the nantucketer out 
of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under 
his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales chapter 15 chowder it was quite 
late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and queequeg and 
i went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none 
but a supper and a bed the landlord of the spouter inn had recommended us 
to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots whom he asserted to be the 
proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had 
assured us that cousin hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in 
short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot luck 
at the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow 
warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard and 
then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to 
the starboard and that done then ask the first man we met where the place 
was these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first especially as at 
the outset queequeg insisted that the yellow first point of be left on the larboard 
hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it was on the starboard however 
by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking 
up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which 
there was no mistaking two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by ears swung 
from the cross trees of an old top mast planted in front of an old 
doorway the horns of the cross trees were sawed off on the other side so 
that this old top mast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i was 
over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i could not help staring at 
this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of crick was in my neck as 
i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes two of them one for queequeg 
and one for me ominous thinks i a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my 
first whaling port tombstones staring at me in the chapel and here a gallows and 
a pair of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints touching 
tophet i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with 
yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a 
dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on 
a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt along with ye said 
she to the man be combing ye on queequeg said i right mrs hussey and 
so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving mrs hussey entirely 
competent to attend to all his affairs upon making known our desires for a supper 
and a bed mrs hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a 
little room and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently 
concluded repast turned round to us and or cod that about cods said i with 
much politeness or cod she repeated clam for supper a cold clam is that what 
you mean mrs hussey says i a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter 
time it mrs hussey but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man 
in the purple shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to 
hear nothing but the word mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the 
kitchen and bawling out for two disappeared said i you think that we can make 
out a supper for us both on one clam however a warm savory steam from 
the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking 
chowder came in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends hearken to me it 
was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship 
biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flakes the whole enriched with butter and 
plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and 
in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly 
excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me 
of mrs clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment stepping 
to the kitchen door i uttered the word with great emphasis and resumed my seat 
in a few moments the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor 
and in good time a fine cod chowder was placed before us we resumed business 
and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i to myself i wonder now 
if this here has any effect on the head that stultifying saying about chowder headed 
people look queequeg that a live eel in your bowl your harpoon fishiest of all 
fishy places was the try pots which well deserved its name for the pots there 
were always boiling chowders chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper 
till you began to look for fish bones coming through your clothes the area before 
the house was paved with clam shells mrs hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish 
vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark skin there 
was a fishy flavor to the milk too which i could not at all account 
for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some boats 
i saw brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each 
foot in a decapitated head looking very slip shod i assure ye supper concluded we 
received a lamp and directions from mrs hussey concerning the nearest way to bed but 
as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her 
arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers not said i 
true whaleman sleeps with his why not dangerous says she since young stiggs coming from 
that of his when he was gone four years and a half with only three 
barrels of ile was found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in 
his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in 
their rooms at night so mr for she had learned his name will just take 
this here iron and keep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or 
cod to morrow for breakfast men says i have a couple of smoked herring by 
way of variety chapter 16 the ship in bed we concocted our plans for the 
morrow but to my surprise and no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand 
that he had been diligently consulting name of his black little yojo had told him 
two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it everyway that instead of our 
going together among the whaling fleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead 
of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest 
wholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to do so 
had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infallibly 
light upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and 
in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the present irrespective of queequeg i 
have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence 
of judgment and surprising forecast of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a 
rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in 
all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs now this plan of or rather 
touching the selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all i 
had not a little relied upon sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to 
carry us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon 
queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with 
a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little 
affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little it seemed 
that it was some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and 
prayer with queequeg and yojo that day how it was i never could find out 
for though i applied myself to it several times i never could master his liturgies 
and xxxix queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his 
sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and 
many random inquiries i learnt that there were three ships up for three devil dam 
the tit bit and the pequod devil dam i do not know the origin of 
tit bit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was the name of a 
celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes i peered and pryed 
about the devil dam from her hopped over to the tit bit and finally going 
on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this 
was the very ship for us you may have seen many a quaint craft in 
your day for aught i know toed luggers mountainous japanese junks butter box galliots and 
what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old 
craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old school 
rather small if anything with an old fashioned claw footed look about her long seasoned 
and weather stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old complexion 
was darkened like a french who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable 
bows looked bearded her somewhere on the coast of japan where her original ones were 
lost overboard in a masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old 
kings of cologne her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrim worshipped flag 
stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these her old antiquities were 
added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wild business that for more than half 
a century she had followed old captain peleg many years her chief mate before he 
commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the 
principal owners of the pequod old peleg during the term of his chief mateship had 
built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of 
material and device unmatched by anything except it be thorkill carved buckler or bedstead she 
was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory 
she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in 
the chased bones of her enemies all round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like 
one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for 
pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to those thews ran not through 
base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea ivory scorning a 
turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was 
in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe 
the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when 
he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow 
a most melancholy all noble things are touched with that now when i looked about 
the quarter deck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a 
candidate for the voyage at first i saw nobody but i could not well overlook 
a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the main mast 
it seemed only a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical shape 
some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken 
from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right whale planted with 
their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped 
towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose 
hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top knot on some old pottowottamie head 
a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded 
a complete view forward and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found 
one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and 
the work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of command he was seated 
on an old fashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom 
of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which 
the wigwam was constructed there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of 
the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen and 
heavily rolled up in blue pilot cloth cut in the quaker style only there was 
a fine and almost microscopic net work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes 
which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking 
to windward this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together such eye 
wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl this the captain of the pequod said i 
advancing to the door of the tent it be the captain of the pequod what 
dost thou want of him he demanded was thinking of shipping wast wast thou i 
see thou art no been in a stove boat sir i never have know nothing 
at all about whaling i dare sir but i have no doubt i shall soon 
learn been several voyages in the merchant service and i think service be damned talk 
not that lingo to me dost see that leg take that leg away from thy 
stern if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed 
i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships but 
flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling eh looks a little suspicious 
it eh not been a pirate hast thou not rob thy last captain didst thou 
not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea i protested my innocence 
of these things i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes this 
old seaman as an insulated quakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather 
distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard what takes 
thee a whaling i want to know that before i think of shipping ye sir 
i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world to see 
what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab is captain ahab sir 
aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship am mistaken then 
i thought i was speaking to the captain himself art speaking to captain who ye 
are speaking to young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the 
pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we 
are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest 
to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in 
a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out 
clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only 
one leg do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale by 
a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed up crunched by 
the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat ah i was a little alarmed by 
his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation 
but said as calmly as i could you say is no doubt true enough sir 
but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though 
indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident ye 
now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft see thou dost not talk 
shark a bit sure been to sea before now sure of that said i thought 
i told you that i had been four voyages in the down out of that 
mind what i said about the marchant aggravate have it but let us understand each 
other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel 
inclined for it do sir good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon 
down a live throat and then jump after it answer quick am sir if it 
should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is 
which i take to be the fact again now then thou not only wantest to 
go a whaling to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also want 
to go in order to see the world was not that what ye said i 
thought so well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weather 
bow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there for a 
moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to 
take it whether humorously or in earnest but concentrating all his feet into one scowl 
captain peleg started me on the errand going forward and glancing over the weather bow 
i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood tide was now 
obliquely pointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding 
not the slightest variety that i could see the report said peleg when i came 
back did ye see much i but water considerable horizon though and a squall coming 
up i think what does thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish 
to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh ye see the 
world where you stand i was a little staggered but go a whaling i must 
and i would and the pequod was as good a ship as thought the all 
this i now repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to 
ship me thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he along with ye 
and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin seated on the 
transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure it turned out 
to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners 
of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being 
held by a crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning 
about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail 
or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the 
same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest now 
bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a quaker the island having been 
originally settled by that sect and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in 
an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified by things 
altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of 
all sailors and whale hunters they are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance 
so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture singularly common 
fashion on the in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the 
quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives strangely 
blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a scandinavian 
sea king or a poetical pagan roman and when these things unite in a man 
of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who has 
also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night watches in the remotest waters 
and beneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and 
independently receiving all sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding 
breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantages to learn a bold 
and nervous lofty man makes one in a whole mighty pageant creature formed for noble 
tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth 
or other circumstances he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom 
of his nature for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness 
be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but as 
yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and 
still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of 
the quaker modified by individual circumstances like captain peleg captain bildad was a well to 
do retired whaleman but unlike captain cared not a rush for what are called serious 
things and indeed deemed those self same serious things the veriest of all bildad had 
not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all 
his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creatures round the 
that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot had not so much 
as altered one angle of his vest still for all this immutableness was there some 
lack of common consistency about worthy captain bildad though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear 
arms against land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though 
a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straight bodied coat spilled 
tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his days 
the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence i do not know but it 
did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come 
to the sage and sensible conclusion that a religion is one thing and this practical 
world quite another this world pays dividends rising from a little cabin boy in short 
clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shad bellied waistcoat from 
that becoming boat header chief mate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad as 
i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at 
the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of 
his well earned income now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of 
being an incorrigible old hunks and in his sea going days a bitter hard task 
master they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when 
he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried 
ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for 
a quaker he was certainly rather hard hearted to say the least he never used 
to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity 
of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad was a chief mate to 
have his drab coloured eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till 
you could clutch hammer or a marling spike and go to work like mad at 
something or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished before him his own person 
was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his long gaunt body he carried 
no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it 
like the worn nap of his broad brimmed hat such then was the person that 
i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin 
the space between the decks was small and there bolt upright sat old bildad who 
always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broad 
brim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was buttoned 
up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a 
ponderous volume cried captain peleg it again bildad eh ye have been studying those scriptures 
now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge how far ye got bildad 
as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad without noticing 
his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg says 
our man bildad said peleg wants to ship thee said bildad in a hollow tone 
and turning round to me dost said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker 
do ye think of him bildad said peleg do said bildad eyeing me and then 
went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible i thought 
him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg his friend and old 
shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg 
now threw open a chest and drawing forth the articles placed pen and ink before 
him and seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high 
time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for 
the voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages 
but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called lays and 
that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties 
of the company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my 
own lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the 
sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt 
that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th is 
the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually 
amount to and though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay 
yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty 
nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of 
my three beef and board for which i would not have to pay one stiver 
it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely so 
it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those that never 
take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to 
board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim sign of the 
thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the 275th lay would be about the 
fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the 200th considering 
i was of a broad shouldered make but one thing nevertheless that made me a 
little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had 
heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they 
being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered 
owners left nearly the whole management of the affairs to these two and i did 
not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say 
about shipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod quite at 
home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his own fireside 
now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack knife old 
bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was such an interested party in 
these proceedings bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himself out of his 
book lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where captain bildad interrupted peleg say 
what lay shall we give this young man knowest best was the sepulchral reply seven 
hundred and seventy seventh be too much would it moth and rust do corrupt but 
lay lay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and seventy seventh 
well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not lay up many 
lays here below where moth and rust do corrupt it was an exceedingly long lay 
that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive 
a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy seven 
is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a teenth of it 
you will then see i say that the seven hundred and seventy seventh part of 
a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy seven gold doubloons 
and so i thought at the time blast your eyes bildad cried peleg dost not 
want to swindle this young man he must have more than that hundred and seventy 
seventh again said bildad without lifting his eyes and then went on where your treasure 
is there will your heart be also am going to put him down for the 
three hundredth said peleg ye hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say bildad 
laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said peleg thou hast a generous 
heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this 
and orphans many of that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young 
man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans the seven 
hundred and seventy seventh lay captain peleg bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about 
the cabin ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matters i 
would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to 
founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn peleg said bildad steadily conscience 
may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms i tell but as thou 
art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but 
a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery 
pit captain peleg pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye 
insult me an all fired outrage to tell any human creature that bound to hell 
flukes and flames bildad say that again to me and start my soul bolts but 
swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on out of the cabin 
ye canting drab coloured son of a wooden straight wake with ye as he thundered 
out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity 
bildad for that time eluded him alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal 
and responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all 
idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside 
from the door to give egress to bildad who i made no doubt was all 
eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he 
sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest 
intention of withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as for 
peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more left in 
him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little as 
if still nervously agitated he whistled at gone off to leeward i think bildad thou 
used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jack 
knife here needs the grindstone he thank ye bildad now then my young man thy 
name ye say well then down ye go here ishmael for the three hundredth lay 
peleg said i have a friend with me who wants to ship i bring him 
down to morrow be sure said peleg him along and look at him lay does 
he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book in which he had again been 
burying himself never thee mind about that bildad said peleg he ever whaled it any 
turning to me more whales than i can count captain peleg bring him along then 
and after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that i had done 
a good work and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided 
to carry queequeg and me round the cape but i had not proceeded far when 
i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet 
remained unseen by me though indeed in many cases a whale ship will be completely 
fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible 
by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shore 
intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any 
absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in 
port but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea however it 
is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into 
his hands turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab was to be 
found what dost thou want of captain ahab all right enough thou art shipped but 
i should like to see him i think thou wilt be able to at present 
i know exactly the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a 
sort of sick and yet he look so in fact he sick but no he 
well either any how young man he always see me so i suppose he will 
thee a queer man captain some a good one oh like him well enough no 
fear no fear a grand ungodly god like man captain ahab speak much but when 
he does speak then you may well listen mark ye be forewarned above the common 
been in colleges as well as the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the 
waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales his lance aye the 
keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he captain bildad no 
and he captain peleg ahab boy and ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned 
king a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs did they 
not lick his blood hither to hither said peleg with a significance in his eye 
that almost startled me ye lad never say that on board the pequod never say 
it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy 
widowed mother who died when he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old 
squaw tistig at gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps other 
fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee a lie 
i know captain ahab well sailed with him as mate years ago i know what 
he good a pious good man like bildad but a swearing good like a good 
deal more of him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and 
i know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind 
for a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that 
brought that about as any one might see i know too that ever since he 
lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale been a kind of moody and 
savage sometimes but that will all pass off and once for all let me tell 
thee and assure thee young man better to sail with a moody good captain than 
a laughing bad one so good bye to wrong not captain ahab because he happens 
to have a wicked name besides my boy he has a three voyages sweet resigned 
girl think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold 
ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab no no my lad 
stricken blasted if he be ahab has his humanities as i walked away i was 
full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me 
with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time i 
felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i know what unless it 
was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange awe 
of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was not 
exactly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it 
did not disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery 
in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then however my thoughts were 
at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark ahab slipped my 
mind chapter 17 the ramadan as ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue all 
day i did not choose to disturb him till towards night fall for i cherish 
the greatest respect towards religious obligations never mind how comical and could not find it 
in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad stool or 
those other creatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of footmanism 
quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor 
merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name i 
say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things and not fancy ourselves 
so vastly superior to other mortals pagans and what not because of their half crazy 
conceits on these subjects there was queequeg now certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about 
yojo and his ramadan what of that queequeg thought he knew what he was about 
i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest all our arguing 
with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on 
us and pagans we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need 
mending towards evening when i felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be 
over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer 
i tried to open it but it was fastened inside said i softly through the 
key hole silent say queequeg why you speak but all remained still as before i 
began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant time i thought he might 
have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the key hole but the door opening 
into an odd corner of the room the key hole prospect was but a crooked 
and sinister one i could only see part of the foot board of the bed 
and a line of the wall but nothing more i was surprised to behold resting 
against the wall the wooden shaft of harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had 
taken from him before our mounting to the chamber strange thought i but at any 
rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it 
therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake still something must have happened 
apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted running down stairs 
i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i chamber maid la she cried 
thought something must be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and 
the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and been just so 
silent ever since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked 
your baggage in for safe keeping la la murder mrs hussey apoplexy with these cries 
she ran towards the kitchen i following mrs hussey soon appeared with a mustard pot 
in one hand and a vinegar cruet in the other having just broken away from 
the occupation of attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy meantime house 
cried i way to it run for sake and fetch something to pry open the 
axe axe had a stroke depend upon it so saying i was unmethodically rushing up 
stairs again empty handed when mrs hussey interposed the mustard pot and vinegar cruet and 
the entire castor of her countenance the matter with you young man the axe for 
sake run for the doctor some one while i pry it open here said the 
landlady quickly putting down the vinegar cruet so as to have one hand free here 
are you talking about prying open any of my doors with that she seized my 
arm the matter with you the matter with you shipmate in as calm but rapid 
a manner as possible i gave her to understand the whole case unconsciously clapping the 
vinegar cruet to one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then i 
seen it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing 
of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that harpoon was missing killed 
himself she cried stiggs done over goes another pity his poor mother will be the 
ruin of my house has the poor lad a sister that girl betty go to 
snarles the painter and tell him to paint me a sign suicides permitted here and 
no smoking in the parlor as well kill both birds at once kill the lord 
be merciful to his ghost that noise there you young man avast there and running 
up after me she caught me as i was again trying to force open the 
door allow it i have my premises spoiled go for the locksmith one about a 
mile from here but avast putting her hand in her side pocket a key fit 
i guess see and with that she turned it in the lock but alas supplemental 
bolt remained unwithdrawn within to burst it open said i and was running down the 
entry a little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing 
i should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with a 
sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark with a prodigious noise the door 
flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling 
and there good heavens there sat queequeg altogether cool and self collected right in the 
middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on top of his 
head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved 
image with scarce a sign of active life said i going up to him the 
matter with you been a so all day has he said the landlady but all 
we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like 
pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost intolerable it 
seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially as in all probability he had been sitting 
so for upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals hussey 
said i alive at all events so leave us if you please and i will 
see to this strange affair myself closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to 
prevail upon queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all 
he could all my polite arts and would not move a peg nor say a 
single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way 
i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do 
they fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be so 
yes part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest get up sooner 
or later no doubt it last for ever thank god and his ramadan only comes 
once a year and i believe very punctual then i went down to supper after 
sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just 
come from a plum pudding voyage as they called it that is a short whaling 
voyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the 
atlantic ocean only after listening to these plum puddingers till nearly eleven i went up 
stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have 
brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he was just where i had 
left him he had not stirred an inch i began to grow vexed with him 
it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half 
the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on 
his head sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and have some supper 
starve kill yourself queequeg but not a word did he reply despairing of him therefore 
i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great 
while he would follow me but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin 
jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night 
and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on for some time do all 
i would i could not get into the faintest doze i had blown out the 
candle and the mere thought of four feet there in that uneasy position stark alone 
in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of it sleeping all 
night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this 
dreary unaccountable ramadan but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till 
break of day when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if he had 
been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of sun 
entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but with a cheerful 
look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said 
his ramadan was over now as i before hinted i have no objection to any 
religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or 
insult any other person because that other person believe it also but when a religion 
becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine makes 
this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then i think it high 
time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him and just so 
i now did with queequeg said i into bed now and lie and listen to 
me i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions 
and coming down to the various religions of the present time during which time i 
labored to show queequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged ham squattings in cold 
cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in 
short to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense i told him too that 
he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me 
very badly pained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan 
of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves 
in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half starved this is 
the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters in one 
word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested 
apple dumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans i then 
asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly 
so that he could take it in he said no only upon one memorable occasion 
it was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining 
of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two 
in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening more queequeg said i 
shuddering will do for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them i had 
seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told me that it 
was the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the 
slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they 
were placed in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and 
cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths were sent round with the compliments to 
all his friends just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys after all 
i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg because 
in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless 
considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not 
more than one third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and finally 
he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than 
i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as 
though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be 
so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety at last we rose and dressed and queequeg 
taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should 
not make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the 
pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones chapter 18 his mark as 
we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carrying his 
harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he 
had not suspected my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no 
cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers do you mean by 
that captain peleg said i now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing 
on the wharf mean he replied must show his papers said captain bildad in his 
hollow voice sticking his head from behind out of the wigwam must show that converted 
son of darkness he added turning to queequeg thou at present in communion with any 
christian church said i a member of the first congregational church here be it said 
that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be converted into 
the churches congregational church cried bildad that worships in deacon deuteronomy meeting house and so 
saying taking out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and 
putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the 
bulwarks took a good long look at queequeg long hath he been a member he 
then said turning to me very long i rather guess young man said peleg he 
been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that blue off his 
face tell now cried bildad this philistine a regular member of deacon meeting i never 
saw him going there and i pass it every day know anything about deacon deuteronomy 
or his meeting said i i know is that queequeg here is a born member 
of the first congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is man said bildad 
sternly art skylarking with thyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me 
finding myself thus hard pushed i replied mean sir the same ancient catholic church to 
which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of us 
and every son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of 
this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some 
queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in that we all join hands thou 
splice hands cried peleg drawing nearer man better ship for a missionary instead of a 
fore mast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon father mapple himself beat it 
and reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers i say tell 
quohog that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what 
a harpoon got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right 
i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head 
of a whale boat did you ever strike a fish without saying a word queequeg 
in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows 
of one of the whale boats hanging to the side and then bracing his left 
knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this you see 
him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale 
eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over 
old broad brim clean across the decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of 
sight said queequeg quietly hauling in the line ee him whale e eye why dad 
whale dead bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the 
flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway i say you bildad and get the 
papers we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look 
ye quohog give ye the ninetieth lay and more than ever was given a harpooneer 
yet out of nantucket so down we went into the cabin and to my great 
joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same company to which i myself belonged when 
all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to 
me and said guess quohog there know how to write does he i say quohog 
blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark but at this question 
queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies looked no ways 
abashed but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an 
exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so that 
through captain obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this quohog his x 
mark meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly 
and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad skirted drab coat took out a 
bundle of tracts and selecting one entitled latter day coming or no time to lose 
placed it in hands and then grasping them and the book with both his looked 
earnestly into his eyes and said of darkness i must do my duty by thee 
i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all 
its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear i 
beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the 
hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness 
gracious steer clear of the fiery pit something of the salt sea yet lingered in 
old language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases there avast there bildad avast now 
spoiling our harpooneer cried peleg harpooneers never make good takes the shark out of no 
harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish there was young nat swaine once 
the bravest boat header out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting 
and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he 
shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of after claps in case he got 
stove and went to davy jones peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thyself 
as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is 
to have the fear of death how then thou prate in this ungodly guise thou 
beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequod here had her three 
masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with 
captain ahab thou not think of death and the judgment then him hear him now 
cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets 
him all of ye think of that when every moment we thought the ship would 
sink death and the judgment then what with all three masts making such an everlasting 
thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us fore and aft think of 
death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then life was 
what captain ahab and i was thinking of and how to save all to rig 
jury to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of bildad 
said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him 
there he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top sail in 
the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an 
end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted chapter 19 the prophet have 
ye shipped in that ship queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were 
sauntering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when 
the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us levelled 
his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was but shabbily apparelled in faded 
jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck a confluent 
small pox had in all directions flowed over his face and left it like the 
complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up ye 
shipped in her he repeated mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to 
gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him the ship there he 
said drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him 
with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object said i 
have just signed the articles down there about your souls what perhaps you got any 
he said quickly matter though i know many chaps that got any luck to and 
they are all the better off for it a a sort of a fifth wheel 
to a wagon are you jabbering about shipmate said i got enough though to make 
up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing 
a nervous emphasis upon the word he said i go this fellow has broken loose 
from somewhere talking about something and somebody we know cried the stranger said seen old 
thunder yet have ye old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestness of 
his manner ahab the captain of our ship the pequod among some of us old 
sailor chaps he goes by that name ye seen him yet have ye we sick 
they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long right 
again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh ye when 
captain ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right 
not before do you know about him did they tell you about him say that 
tell much of anything about him only heard that a good whale hunter and a 
good captain to his crew true both true enough but you must jump when he 
gives an order step and growl growl and the word with captain ahab but nothing 
about that thing that happened to him off cape horn long ago when he lay 
like dead for three days and nights nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard 
afore the altar in santa nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash he 
spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy 
ye hear a word about them matters and something more eh no i think ye 
did how could ye who knows it not all nantucket i guess but mayhap heard 
tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that 
i dare say oh yes that every one knows mean they know only one leg 
and that a parmacetti took the other off friend said i all this gibberish of 
yours is about i know and i much care for it seems to me that 
you must be a little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of 
captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i 
know all about the loss of his leg all about it you do sure with 
finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggar like stranger stood a moment 
as if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and said shipped have 
ye names down on the papers well well signed is signed and to be will 
be and then again perhaps it be after all anyhow all fixed and arranged and 
some sailors or other must go with him i suppose as well these as any 
other men god pity morning to ye shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye sorry 
i stopped ye here friend said i you have anything important to tell us out 
with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are mistaken in 
your game all i have to say said very well and i like to hear 
a chap talk up that way you are just the man for likes of ye 
morning to ye shipmates morning oh when ye get there tell concluded not to make 
one of my dear fellow you fool us that fool us it is the easiest 
thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great 
secret in him to ye shipmates morning it is said i along queequeg leave this 
crazy man but stop tell me your name will you elijah thought i and we 
walked away both commenting after each fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that 
he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not 
gone perhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and looking back 
as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us though at a 
distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg 
of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the 
stranger would turn the same corner that we did he did and then it seemed 
to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for 
the life of me imagine this circumstance coupled with his ambiguous half hinting half revealing 
shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half 
apprehensions and all connected with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg he had 
lost and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had 
said of him when i left the ship the day previous and the prediction of 
the squaw tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred 
other shadowy things i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really 
dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg and on 
that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on without seeming to notice 
us this relieved me and once more and finally as it seemed to me i 
pronounced him in my heart a humbug chapter 20 all astir a day or two 
passed and there was great activity aboard the pequod not only were the old sails 
being mended but new sails were coming on board and bolts of canvas and coils 
of rigging in short everything betokened that the preparations were hurrying to a close captain 
peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look 
out upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores and 
the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after 
night fall on the day following signing the articles word was given at all the 
inns where the company were stopping that their chests must be on board before night 
for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and 
i got down our traps resolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it 
seems they always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not 
sail for several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done 
and there is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequod 
was fully equipped every one knows what a multitude of sauce pans knives and forks 
shovels and tongs napkins nut crackers and what not are indispensable to the business of 
housekeeping just so with whaling which necessitates a three housekeeping upon the wide ocean far 
from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers and though this also holds true of 
merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen for 
besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution 
of the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented 
it must be remembered that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposed to 
accidents of all kinds and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things 
upon which the success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boats spare spars 
and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare captain and duplicate 
ship at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the 
pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoops and 
staves but as before hinted for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying 
on board of divers odds and ends of things both large and small chief among 
those who did this fetching and carrying was captain sister a lean old lady of 
a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if 
she could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once fairly 
getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar of 
pickles for the pantry another time with a bunch of quills for the chief desk 
where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the 
small of some rheumatic back never did any woman better deserve her name which was 
charity as everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt 
charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything 
that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in 
which her beloved brother bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score 
or two of well saved dollars but it was startling to see this excellent hearted 
quakeress coming on board as she did the last day with a long oil ladle 
in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad 
himself nor captain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with him 
a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his 
mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a while peleg came hobbling 
out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchways roaring up to 
the riggers at the mast head and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam 
during these days of preparation queequeg and i often visited the craft and as often 
i asked about captain ahab and how he was and when he was going to 
come on board his ship to these questions they would answer that he was getting 
better and better and was expected aboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and 
bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i 
had been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart 
that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage 
without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator 
of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea but when 
a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in 
the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself and much 
this way it was with me i said nothing and tried to think nothing at 
last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail 
so next morning queequeg and i took a very early start chapter 21 going aboard 
it was nearly six but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the 
wharf are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to queequeg 
be shadows off by sunrise i guess come on cried a voice whose owner at 
the same time coming close behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and 
then insinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely 
peering from queequeg to me it was elijah aboard off will you said i here 
said queequeg shaking himself going aboard then we are said i what business is that 
of yours do you know mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent no 
no i aware of that said elijah slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg 
with the most unaccountable glances said i will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing 
we are going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefer not to be 
detained be be ye coming back afore breakfast cracked queequeg said i on cried stationary 
elijah hailing us when we had removed a few paces mind him said i come 
on but he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my 
shoulder ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago struck 
by this plain matter of fact question i answered saying i thought i did see 
four or five men but it was too dim to be sure dim very dim 
said elijah to ye once more we quitted him but once more he came softly 
after us and touching my shoulder again said if you can find now will ye 
who to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off i was going to 
warn ye never mind never all one all in the family too frost this morning 
it good bye to ye see ye again very soon i guess unless before the 
grand jury and with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for the moment 
in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence at last stepping on board the pequod 
we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked 
within the hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward to 
the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a light we went 
down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered pea jacket he 
was thrown at whole length upon two chests his face downwards and inclosed in his 
folded arms the profoundest slumber slept upon him sailors we saw queequeg where can they 
have gone to said i looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when 
on the wharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence 
i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it 
not for otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the thing down and again marking the 
sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body 
telling him to establish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the rear as though 
feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there 
queequeg sit there said i perry dood seat said queequeg country way hurt him face 
said i that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes heaving 
himself get off queequeg you are heavy grinding the face of the poor get off 
queequeg look twitch you off soon i wonder he wake queequeg removed himself to just 
beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the 
feet we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile 
upon questioning him in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his 
land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king chiefs 
and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders 
for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to 
buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers and 
alcoves besides it was very convenient on an excursion much better than those garden chairs 
which are convertible into walking sticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring 
him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp 
marshy place while narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me he 
flourished the hatchet side of it over the head that for queequeg easy kill e 
oh perry easy he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk pipe 
which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his 
soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the strong vapor now completely 
filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him he breathed with a sort 
of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then 
sat up and rubbed his eyes he breathed at last be ye smokers men answered 
i does she sail aye ye are going in her be ye she sails to 
day the captain came aboard last night captain but him indeed i was going to 
ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we heard a noise on deck astir 
said the rigger a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all 
alive now i must turn to and so saying he went on deck and we 
followed it was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and 
threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively engaged and several of the shore 
people were busy in bringing various last things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly 
enshrined within his cabin chapter 22 merry christmas at length towards noon upon the final 
dismissal of the riggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf 
and after the ever thoughtful charity had come off in a whale boat with her 
last night cap for stubb the second mate her brother in law and a spare 
bible for the all this the two captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin 
and turning to the chief mate peleg said mr starbuck are you sure everything is 
right captain ahab is all spoke to more to be got from shore eh well 
call all hands then muster aft need of profane words however great the hurry peleg 
said bildad away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding how now here upon 
the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going 
it with a high hand on the quarter deck just as if they were to 
be joint commanders at sea as well as to all appearances in port and as 
for captain ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said 
he was in the cabin but then the idea was that his presence was by 
no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to 
sea indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the and as 
he was not yet completely they captain ahab stayed below and all this seemed natural 
enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for 
a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having 
a farewell merry making with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good 
with the pilot but there was not much chance to think over the matter for 
captain peleg was now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and 
commanding and not bildad here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered 
at the main mast starbuck drive aft the tent there the next order as i 
hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the 
pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be 
the next thing to heaving up the anchor the capstan blood and thunder the next 
command and the crew sprang for the handspikes now in getting under weigh the station 
generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad 
who with peleg be it known in addition to his other officers was one of 
the licensed pilots of the being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in 
order to save the nantucket pilot fee to all the ships he was concerned in 
for he never piloted any other i say might now be seen actively engaged in 
looking over the bows for the approaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a 
dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some 
sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good will nevertheless 
not three days previous bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed 
on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed 
a small choice copy of watts in each berth meantime overseeing the other part of 
the ship captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost 
thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i 
paused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the perils 
we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot 
i was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious bildad might be found 
some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventy seventh lay when i felt a 
sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparition of 
captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was 
my first kick that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared thou 
sheep head spring and break thy backbone why ye spring i say all of quohog 
spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there scotch cap spring thou green pants 
spring i say all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he 
moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad 
kept leading off with his psalmody thinks i captain peleg must have been drinking something 
to day at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we 
glided it was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into 
night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us 
in ice as in polished armor the long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened 
in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving 
icicles depended from the bows lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever 
and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the 
shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady 
notes were heard fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green so to 
the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between never did those sweet words sound 
more sweetly to me than then they were full of hope and fruition spite of 
this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter 
jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store 
and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring 
untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer at last we gained such an offing that the two 
pilots were needed no longer the stout sail boat that had accompanied us began ranging 
alongside it was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected at this 
juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good 
a ship bound on so long and perilous a both stormy capes a ship in 
which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an 
old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting 
to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say good bye to 
a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him old bildad lingered long 
paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell 
word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and 
endless waters only bounded by the far off unseen eastern continents looked towards the land 
looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling 
a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up 
a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to 
say friend peleg i can stand it yes i can as for peleg himself he 
took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there was a tear 
twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near and he too did not 
a little run from cabin to a word below and now a word with starbuck 
the chief mate but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort 
of look about him old shipmate we must go back the main yard there boat 
ahoy stand by to come close alongside now careful careful bildad your last luck to 
ye to ye mr to ye mr bye and good luck to ye this day 
three years have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away 
bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men murmured old bildad almost incoherently 
hope have fine weather now so that captain ahab may soon be moving among pleasant 
sun is all he needs and have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye 
go be careful in the hunt ye mates stave the boats needlessly ye harpooneers good 
white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year forget your prayers 
either mr starbuck mind that cooper waste the spare staves oh the sail needles are 
in the green locker whale it too much days men but miss a fair chance 
either rejecting good gifts have an eye to the molasses tierce mr stubb it was 
a little leaky i thought if ye touch at the islands mr flask beware of 
fornication good bye good bye keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr 
starbuck spoil be careful with the cents the pound it was and mind ye come 
captain bildad stop palavering and with that peleg hurried him over the side and both 
dropt into the boat ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between 
a screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave three heavy hearted 
cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic chapter 23 the lee shore 
some chapters back one bulkington was spoken of a tall newlanded mariner encountered in new 
bedford at the inn when on that shivering night the pequod thrust her vindictive bows 
into the cold malicious waves who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington 
i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in mid winter just 
landed from a four dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another 
tempestuous term the land seemed scorching to his feet wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable 
deep memories yield no epitaphs this six inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington 
let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm tossed ship 
that miserably drives along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port 
is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blankets friends all kind 
to our mortalities but in that gale the port the land is that direst jeopardy 
she must fly all hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel 
would make her shudder through and through with all her might she crowds all sail 
off shore in so doing fights the very winds that fain would blow her homeward 
seeks all the lashed landlessness again for sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend 
her bitterest foe know ye now bulkington glimpses do ye seem to see of that 
mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the 
soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven 
and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore but as in landlessness 
alone resides highest truth shoreless indefinite as better is it to perish in that howling 
infinite than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety for worm 
like then oh who would craven crawl to land terrors of the terrible is all 
this agony so vain take heart take heart o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up 
from the spray of thy ocean up leaps thy apotheosis chapter 24 the advocate as 
queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this 
business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical 
and disreputable pursuit therefore i am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the 
injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales in the first place it may be 
deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of 
whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions if 
a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the 
general opinion of his merits were he presented to the company as a harpooneer say 
and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials s w 
f sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed pre 
eminently presuming and ridiculous doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen 
is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of 
business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements 
butchers we are that is true but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge 
have been all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor and as for 
the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into 
certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the 
sperm whale ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but even 
granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of a whale 
ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle fields from which so many 
soldiers return to drink in all plaudits and if the idea of peril so much 
enhances the popular conceit of the profession let me assure ye that many a veteran 
who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of 
the sperm vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head for what are 
the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god but 
though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it unwittingly pay us the 
profoundest homage yea an all abounding adoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles 
that burn round the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory but 
look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see 
what we whalemen are and have been why did the dutch in de time have 
admirals of their whaling fleets why did louis xvi of france at his own personal 
expense fit out whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score 
or two of families from our own island of nantucket why did britain between the 
years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of 000 000 and 
lastly how comes it that we whalemen of america now outnumber all the rest of 
the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels 
manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming 4 000 000 of dollars the ships worth 
at the time of sailing 20 000 000 and every year importing into our harbors 
a well reaped harvest of 7 000 000 how comes all this if there be 
not something puissant in whaling but this is not the half look again i freely 
assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence 
which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world 
taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way and 
another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their 
sequential issues that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring 
themselves pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all 
these things let a handful suffice for many years past the whale ship has been 
the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth she 
has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had 
ever sailed if american and european men of war now peacefully ride in once savage 
harbors let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale ship which 
originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savages they may 
celebrate as they will the heroes of exploring expeditions your cooks your krusensterns but i 
say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket that were as great 
and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their succourless empty handedness they 
in the heathenish sharked waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with 
virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly 
have dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea 
voyages those things were but the life time commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers often adventures 
which vancouver dedicates three chapters to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in 
the common log ah the world oh the world until the whale fishery rounded cape 
horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europe 
and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast it was 
the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown touching those 
colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at 
last eventuated the liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain 
and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts that great america on the 
other side of the sphere australia was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman 
after its first blunder born discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunned those 
shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whale ship touched there the whale ship is the 
true mother of that now mighty colony moreover in the infancy of the first australian 
settlement the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the 
whale ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters the uncounted isles of all polynesia 
confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whale ship that cleared the 
way for the missionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries 
to their first destinations if that double bolted land japan is ever to become hospitable 
it is the whale ship alone to whom the credit will be due for already 
she is on the threshold but if in the face of all this you still 
declare that whaling has no æsthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready 
to shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every 
time the whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say 
the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler who wrote the first account 
of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed the first narrative of a 
whaling voyage who but no less a prince than alfred the great who with his 
own royal pen took down the words from other the norwegian whale hunter of those 
times and who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke true enough 
but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no good blood in their veins 
no good blood in their veins they have something better than royal blood there the 
grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the 
old settlers of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and kith 
and kin to noble day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world 
to the other good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable 
whaling not respectable whaling is imperial by old english statutory law the whale is declared 
royal fish oh only nominal the whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing 
way the whale never figured in any grand imposing way in one of the mighty 
triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the capital the bones of a 
whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in 
the cymballed procession see subsequent chapters for something more on this head grant it since 
you cite it but say what you will there is no real dignity in whaling 
no dignity in whaling the dignity of our calling the very heavens attest cetus is 
a constellation in the south no more drive down your hat in presence of the 
czar and take it off to queequeg no more i know a man that in 
his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty whales i account that man more honorable 
than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns and 
as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing 
in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high 
hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do 
anything that upon the whole a man might rather have done than to have left 
undone if at my death my executors or more properly my creditors find any precious 
mss in my desk then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory 
to whaling for a whale ship was my yale college and my harvard chapter 25 
postscript in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but substantiated 
facts but after embattling his facts an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable 
surmise which might tell eloquently upon his an advocate would he not be blameworthy it 
is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern ones a 
certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through there is a 
saltcellar of state so called and there may be a castor of state how they 
use the salt knows certain i am however that a head is solemnly oiled at 
his coronation even as a head of salad can it be though that they anoint 
it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint machinery much 
might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common 
life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably 
smells of that anointing in truth a mature man who uses hair oil unless medicinally 
that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere as a general rule 
he amount to much in his totality but the only thing to be considered here 
is kind of oil is used at coronations certainly it cannot be olive oil nor 
macassar oil nor castor oil nor oil nor train oil nor cod liver oil what 
then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweetest 
of all oils think of that ye loyal britons we whalemen supply your kings and 
queens with coronation stuff chapter 26 knights and squires the chief mate of the pequod 
was starbuck a native of nantucket and a quaker by descent he was a long 
earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot 
latitudes his flesh being hard as twice baked biscuit transported to the indies his live 
blood would not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time 
of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his 
state is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen those summers had dried 
up all his physical superfluousness but this his thinness so to speak seemed no more 
the token of wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily 
blight it was merely the condensation of the man he was by no means ill 
looking quite the contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped 
up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian this 
starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come and to endure always as 
now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior 
vitality was warranted to do well in all climates looking into his eyes you seemed 
to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand fold perils he had calmly 
confronted through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a 
telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sounds yet for all his 
hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities in him which at times affected and 
in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a 
seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life 
did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in 
some organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portents and 
inward presentiments were his and if at times these things bent the welded iron of 
his soul much more did his far away domestic memories of his young cape wife 
and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature 
and open him still further to those latent influences which in some honest hearted men 
restrain the gush of dare devil daring so often evinced by others in the more 
perilous vicissitudes of the fishery will have no man in my boat said starbuck is 
not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean not only that the 
most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the 
encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than 
a coward aye said stubb the second mate there is as careful a man as 
find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long see what that word precisely 
means when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter starbuck 
was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a sentiment but a thing 
simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions besides he 
thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage was one of the great staple 
outfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly 
wasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun down nor for 
persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him for thought starbuck 
i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not 
to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so 
killed starbuck well knew what doom was his own where in the bottomless deeps could 
he find the torn limbs of his brother with memories like these in him and 
moreover given to a certain superstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck 
which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but it was not in 
reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as 
he had it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering 
an element in him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its confinement and 
burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it was that sort 
of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm in the 
conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of 
the world yet cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace 
you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man but were the coming 
narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor fortitude scarce might i 
have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking 
to expose the fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable as joint 
stock companies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be men may have mean 
and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such 
a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows 
should run to throw their costliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so 
far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds 
with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor ruined man nor can piety 
itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars but 
this august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but 
that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture thou shalt see it shining in the 
arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on all 
hands radiates without end from god himself the great god absolute the centre and circumference 
of all democracy his omnipresence our divine equality if then to meanest mariners and renegades 
and castaways i shall hereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round them tragic graces 
if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among them all shall at times 
lift himself to the exalted mounts if i shall touch that arm with some ethereal 
light if i shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun then against 
all mortal critics bear me out in it thou just spirit of equality which hast 
spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind bear me out in it 
thou great democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the pale 
poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold the stumped 
and paupered arm of old cervantes thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the 
pebbles who didst hurl him upon a war horse who didst thunder him higher than 
a throne thou who in all thy mighty earthly marchings ever cullest thy selectest champions 
from the kingly commons bear me out in it o god chapter 27 knights and 
squires stubb was the second mate he was a native of cape cod and hence 
according to local usage was called a cape cod man a happy go lucky neither 
craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indifferent air and while engaged 
in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a 
journeyman joiner engaged for the year good humored easy and careless he presided over his 
whale boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew 
all invited guests he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of 
the boat as an old stage driver is about the snugness of his box when 
close to the whale in the very death lock of the fight he handled his 
unpitying lance coolly and off handedly as a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum 
over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long 
usage had for this stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair what 
he thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of it 
at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his 
mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took 
it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir 
themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and 
not sooner what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easy going unfearing man 
so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave 
pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that 
almost impious good humor of his that thing must have been his pipe for like 
his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his 
face you would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk 
without his nose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipes there 
ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he 
turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to 
the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew for 
when stubb dressed instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers he put his 
pipe into his mouth i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at 
least of his peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore 
or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have 
died exhaling it and as in time of the cholera some people go about with 
a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations tobacco smoke might 
have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent the third mate was flask a native 
of tisbury in vineyard a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who 
somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him and 
therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him to destroy them whenever 
encountered so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels 
of their majestic bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension 
of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale 
was but a species of magnified mouse or at least water rat requiring only a 
little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and 
boil this ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter 
of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three voyage 
round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time as 
a nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly 
divided little flask was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last 
long they called him king post on board of the pequod because in form he 
could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in arctic 
whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it serves 
to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas now these three 
stubb and flask were momentous men they it was who by universal prescription commanded three 
of the boats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab 
would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three headsmen were as 
captains of companies or being armed with their long keen whaling spears they were as 
a picked trio of lancers even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins and since 
in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic knight of old is 
always accompanied by his boat steerer or harpooneer who in certain conjunctures provides him with 
a fresh lance when the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the 
assault and moreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness 
it is therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the harpooneers 
were and to what headsman each of them belonged first of all was queequeg whom 
starbuck the chief mate had selected for his squire but queequeg is already known next 
was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of vineyard where 
there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which has long 
supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers in the 
fishery they usually go by the generic name of gay headers long lean sable hair 
his high cheek bones and black rounding an indian oriental in their largeness but antarctic 
in their glittering this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those 
proud warrior hunters who in quest of the great new england moose had scoured bow 
in hand the aboriginal forests of the main but no longer snuffing in the trail 
of the wild beasts of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the 
great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible 
arrow of the sires to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs 
you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans and half 
believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of 
the air tashtego was stubb the second squire third among the harpooneers was daggoo a 
gigantic coal black negro savage with a lion like ahasuerus to behold suspended from his 
ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called them ring bolts and 
would talk of securing the top sail halyards to them in his youth daggoo had 
voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native 
coast and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the 
pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many years the bold 
life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of 
men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and erect as a giraffe moved 
about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks there 
was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before 
him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress curious to tell 
this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo was the squire of little flask who looked like a 
chess man beside him as for the residue of the company be it said that 
at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the 
mast employed in the american whale fishery are americans born though pretty nearly all the 
officers are herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with the 
american army and military and merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the construction 
of the american canals and railroads the same i say because in all these cases 
the native american liberally provides the brains the rest of the world as generously supplying 
the muscles no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the 
outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of 
those rocky shores in like manner the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or london 
put in at the shetland islands to receive the full complement of their crew upon 
the passage homewards they drop them there again how it is there is no telling 
but islanders seem to make the best whalemen they were nearly all islanders in the 
pequod isolatoes too i call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each 
isolato living on a separate continent of his own yet now federated along one keel 
what a set these isolatoes were an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of 
the sea and all the ends of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod 
to lay the grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever 
come back black little never no he went before poor alabama boy on the grim 
forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time 
when sent for to the great quarter deck on high he was bid strike in 
with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero 
there chapter 28 ahab for several days after leaving nantucket nothing above hatches was seen 
of captain ahab the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches and for aught 
that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commanders of 
the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory 
that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and 
dictator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the 
now sacred retreat of the cabin every time i ascended to the deck from my 
watches below i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for 
my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea 
became almost a perturbation this was strangely heightened at times by the ragged diabolical incoherences 
uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of 
but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moods i was almost ready 
to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves but whatever 
it was of apprehensiveness or call it i felt yet whenever i came to look 
about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions for 
though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric 
heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchant ship companies which my previous 
experiences had made me acquainted with still i ascribed rightly ascribed the fierce uniqueness of 
the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked 
but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship the 
mates which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings and induce confidence and 
cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three better more likely sea officers and men 
each in his own different way could not readily be found and they were every 
one of them americans a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being christmas 
when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting polar 
weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every 
degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all 
its intolerable weather behind us it was one of those less lowering but still grey 
and gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the ship was 
rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as 
i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as 
i levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shivers ran over me reality outran apprehension 
captain ahab stood upon his quarter deck there seemed no sign of common bodily illness 
about him nor of the recovery from any he looked like a man cut away 
from the stake when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them 
or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness his whole high broad form 
seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like cast perseus threading 
its way out from among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of 
his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a 
slender rod like mark lividly whitish it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the 
straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it 
and without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to 
bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded 
whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by 
some desperate wound no one could certainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage 
little or no allusion was made to it especially by the mates but once senior 
an old gay head indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was 
full forty years old did ahab become that way branded and then it came upon 
him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at 
sea yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated an 
old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of nantucket had never ere this 
laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the old sea traditions the immemorial credulities popularly invested 
this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment so that no white sailor seriously contradicted 
him when he said that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly laid might hardly 
come to pass so he whoever should do that last office for the dead would 
find a birth mark on him from crown to sole so powerfully did the whole 
grim aspect of ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for 
the first few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness 
was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously 
come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished 
bone of the sperm jaw he was dismasted off japan said the old gay head 
indian once like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it 
he has a quiver of i was struck with the singular posture he maintained upon 
each side of the quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds there was 
an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank his bone 
leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud captain ahab 
stood erect looking straight out beyond the ever pitching prow there was an infinity of 
firmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that 
glance not a word he spoke nor did his officers say aught to him though 
by all their minutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful 
consciousness of being under a troubled master eye and not only that but moody stricken 
ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal 
overbearing dignity of some mighty woe ere long from his first visit in the air 
he withdrew into his cabin but after that morning he was every day visible to 
the crew either standing in his pivot hole or seated upon an ivory stool he 
had or heavily walking the deck as the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to 
grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if when 
the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea 
had then kept him so secluded and by and by it came to pass that 
he was almost continually in the air but as yet for all that he said 
or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as 
another mast but the pequod was only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly 
all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to so that there was 
little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase 
away for that one interval the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his 
brow as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon nevertheless ere 
long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually 
to charm him from his mood for as when the red cheeked dancing girls april 
and may trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest most thunder 
cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such 
glad hearted visitants so ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful 
allurings of that girlish air more than once did he put forth the faint blossom 
of a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in a 
smile chapter 29 enter ahab to him stubb some days elapsed and ice and icebergs 
all astern the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea 
almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic the warmly 
cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant days were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet heaped 
up with rose water snow the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled 
velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earls the 
golden helmeted suns for sleeping man hard to choose between such winsome days and such 
seducing nights but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new 
spells and potencies to the outward world inward they turned upon the soul especially when 
the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the 
clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights and all these subtle agencies more and more 
they wrought on texture old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with 
life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death among sea 
commanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night cloaked deck 
it was so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to 
live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin 
than from the cabin to the planks feels like going down into tomb would mutter 
to an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to 
my grave dug berth so almost every twenty four hours when the watches of the 
night were set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below 
and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors flung 
it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt it to its 
place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when this sort of steady quietude would 
begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabin scuttle and ere long 
the old man would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way 
some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like these he usually 
abstained from patrolling the quarter deck because to his wearied mates seeking repose within six 
inches of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of 
that bony step that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks 
but once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with 
heavy lumber like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the 
old second mate came up from below with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that 
if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay 
but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly 
about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel ah 
stubb thou didst not know ahab then i a cannon ball stubb said ahab thou 
wouldst wad me that fashion but go thy ways i had forgot below to thy 
nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling 
one at last dog and kennel starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so 
suddenly scornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly am not used 
to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like it 
sir gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid 
some passionate temptation sir not yet said stubb emboldened will not tamely be called a 
dog sir be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and 
begone or clear the world of thee as he said this ahab advanced upon him 
with such overbearing terrors in his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated was never served so 
before without giving a hard blow for it muttered stubb as he found himself descending 
the cabin scuttle very queer stop stubb somehow now i well know whether to go 
back and strike him that here on my knees and pray for him yes that 
was the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i 
ever did pray queer very queer and queer too aye take him fore and aft 
about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with how he flashed at me eyes 
like powder pans is he mad anyway something on his mind as sure as there 
must be something on a deck when it cracks he aint in his bed now 
either more than three hours out of the twenty four and he sleep then that 
dough boy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old 
hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the 
coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though 
a baked brick had been on it a hot old man i guess got what 
some folks ashore call a conscience a kind of tic dolly row they nor a 
toothache well well i know what it is but the lord keep me from catching 
it full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the after hold for every 
night as dough boy tells me he suspects that for i should like to know 
made appointments with him in the hold that queer now but no telling the old 
goes for a snooze damn me worth a while to be born into the world 
if only to fall right asleep and now that i think of it about the 
first thing babies do and a sort of queer too damn me but all things 
are queer come to think of but against my principles think not is my eleventh 
commandment and sleep when you can is my here goes again but that he call 
me a dog blazes he called me ten times a donkey and piled a lot 
of jackasses on top of that he might as well have kicked me and done 
with it maybe he did kick me and i observe it i was so taken 
all aback with his brow somehow it flashed like a bleached bone what the the 
matter with me i stand right on my legs coming afoul of that old man 
has a sort of turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have 
been dreaming how how the only to stash it so here goes to hammock again 
and in the morning see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight chapter 30 
the pipe when stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks 
and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the 
watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe lighting the 
pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the 
deck he sat and smoked in old norse times the thrones of the sea loving 
danish kings were fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale how could one 
look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without bethinking him of the 
royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea 
and a great lord of leviathans was ahab some moments passed during which the thick 
vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs which blew back again into 
his face now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube smoking no longer soothes oh 
my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone here have 
i been unconsciously toiling not and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward 
and with such nervous whiffs as if like the dying whale my final jets were 
the strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this pipe this thing 
that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs 
not among torn iron grey locks like mine smoke no he tossed the still lighted 
pipe into the sea the fire hissed in the waves the same instant the ship 
shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made with slouched hat ahab lurchingly paced the 
planks chapter 31 queen mab next morning stubb accosted flask a queer dream king post 
i never had you know the old ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me 
with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man 
i kicked my leg right off and then presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i 
like a blazing fool kept kicking at it but what was still more curious know 
how curious all dreams all this rage that i was in i somehow seemed to 
be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that 
kick from ahab thinks i the row not a real leg only a false leg 
and a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump what makes a 
blow from the hand flask fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from 
a cane the living makes the living insult my little man and thinks i to 
myself all the while mind while i was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed 
confoundedly contradictory was it all all the while i say i was thinking to myself 
his leg now but a whalebone cane yes thinks i was only a playful fact 
only a whaleboning that he gave a base kick besides thinks i at it once 
why the end of foot a small sort of end it is whereas if a 
broad footed farmer kicked me a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled down 
to a point only but now comes the greatest joke of the dream flask while 
i was battering away at the pyramid a sort of badger haired old merman with 
a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders and slews me round are 
you says he slid man but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next 
moment i was over the fright am i about says i at last what business 
is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do you want a 
kick by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round 
his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had 
for a do you think i saw thunder alive man his stern was stuck full 
of marlinspikes with the points out says i on second thoughts guess i kick you 
old fellow stubb said he stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort 
of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he going to stop 
saying over his stubb wise stubb i thought i might as well fall to kicking 
the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he 
roared out that kicking says i the matter now old fellow ye here says he 
argue the insult captain ahab kicked ye he he did says here it was good 
says used his ivory leg he he did says i then says he stubb what 
have you to complain of he kick with right good will it a common pitch 
pine leg he kicked with was it no you were kicked by a great man 
and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb an honor i consider it an honor listen 
wise stubb in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped 
by a queen and made garter knights of but be your boast stubb that ye 
were kicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say 
be kicked by him account his kicks honors and on no account kick back for 
you help yourself wise stubb you see that pyramid with that he all of a 
sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air i snored 
rolled over and there i was in my hammock now what do you think of 
that dream flask know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho be may 
be but made a wise man of me flask see ahab standing there sideways looking 
over the stern well the best thing you can do flask is to let the 
old man alone never speak to him whatever he says halloa that he shouts hark 
head there look sharp all of ye there are whales hereabouts ye see a white 
one split your lungs for him do you think of that now flask there a 
small drop of something queer about that eh a white ye mark that man look 
something special in the wind stand by for it flask ahab has that bloody on 
his mind but mum he comes this way chapter 32 cetology already we are boldly 
launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in its unshored harbourless immensities 
ere that come to pass ere the weedy hull rolls side by side with the 
barnacled hulls of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to 
a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations 
and allusions of all sorts which are to follow it is some systematized exhibition of 
the whale in his broad genera that i would now fain put before you yet 
is it no easy task the classification of the constituents of a chaos nothing less 
is here essayed listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down branch 
of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled cetology says captain scoresby 
a d 1820 is not my intention were it in my power to enter into 
the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families 
utter confusion exists among the historians of this sperm whale says surgeon beale a d 
1839 to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters veil covering our knowledge of the 
cetacea field strewn with thorns these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists thus 
speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those lights of 
zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of books there 
are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of 
whales many are the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who 
have at large or in little written of the whale run over a few authors 
of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linnæus rondeletius willoughby green 
artedi sibbald brisson marten lacépède bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier john hunter owen scoresby 
beale bennett j ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t 
cheever but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extracts 
will show of the names in this list of whale authors only those following owen 
ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and 
whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate subject of the greenland or right whale 
he is the best existing authority but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the 
great sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning and here 
be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the 
seas he is not even by any means the largest of the whales yet owing 
to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy 
years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm whale and which ignorance to 
this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale ports 
this usurpation has been every way complete reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in 
the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one 
rival was to them the monarch of the seas but the time has at last 
come for a new proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people all greenland 
whale is deposed great sperm whale now reigneth there are only two books in being 
which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the 
same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt those books are and both 
in their time surgeons to english south sea whale ships and both exact and reliable 
men the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is 
necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostly 
confined to scientific description as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not 
complete in any literature far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life 
now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only 
an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all its departments 
by subsequent laborers as no better man advances to take this matter in hand i 
hereupon offer my own poor endeavors i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed 
to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend 
to a minute anatomical description of the various species this place at much of any 
description my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology 
i am the architect not the builder but it is a ponderous task no ordinary 
letter sorter in the post office is equal to it to grope down into the 
bottom of the sea after them to have hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and 
very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i that i 
should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful tauntings in job might 
well appal me will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee behold the hope 
of him is vain but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans i 
have had to do with whales with these visible hands i am in earnest and 
i will try there are some preliminaries to settle first the uncertain unsettled condition of 
this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in 
some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in 
his system of nature a d 1776 linnæus declares hereby separate the whales from the 
fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year 1850 sharks 
and shad alewives and herring against express edict were still found dividing the possession of 
the same seas with the leviathan the grounds upon which linnæus would fain have banished 
the whales from the waters he states as follows account of their warm bilocular heart 
their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally 
lege naturæ jure meritoque i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley 
coffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united in 
the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient charley profanely hinted they were 
humbug be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned ground 
that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me this 
fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect does the whale differ 
from other fish above linnæus has given you those items but in brief they are 
these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded next 
how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicuously to label 
him for all time to come to be short then a whale is a spouting 
fish with a horizontal tail there you have him however contracted that definition is the 
result of expanded meditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is 
not a fish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is 
still more cogent as coupled with the first almost any one must have noticed that 
all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a vertical or up 
and down tail whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped 
invariably assumes a horizontal position by the above definition of what a whale is i 
do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with 
the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it 
any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed 
fish must be included in this ground plan of cetology now then come the grand 
divisions of the entire whale host i am aware that down to the present time 
the fish styled lamatins and dugongs pig fish and sow fish of the coffins of 
nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales but as these pig fish are 
a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet 
hay and especially as they do not spout i deny their credentials as whales and 
have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology first according to 
magnitude i divide the whales into three primary books subdivisible into chapters and these shall 
comprehend them all both small and large i the folio whale ii the octavo whale 
iii the duodecimo whale as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale 
of the octavo the grampus of the duodecimo the porpoise folios among these i here 
include the following chapters the sperm whale ii the right whale iii the fin back 
whale iv the hump backed whale v the razor back whale vi the sulphur bottom 
whale book i folio chapter i sperm whale whale among the english of old vaguely 
known as the trumpa whale and the physeter whale and the anvil headed whale is 
the present cachalot of the french and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus 
of the long words he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the 
most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by 
far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable 
substance spermaceti is obtained all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged upon 
it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically considered it 
is absurd some centuries ago when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his 
own proper individuality and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish 
in those days spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a 
creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale 
it was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the 
greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses in those times also 
spermaceti was exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment and 
medicament it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an 
ounce of rhubarb when as i opine in the course of time the true nature 
of spermaceti became known its original name was still retained by the dealers no doubt 
to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity and so 
the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which 
this spermaceti was really derived book i folio chapter ii right whale one respect this 
is the most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly hunted by man 
it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known 
as oil an inferior article in commerce among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by 
all the following titles the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale 
the true whale the right whale there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity 
of the species thus multitudinously baptised what then is the whale which i include in 
the second species of my folios it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists 
the greenland whale of the english whalemen the baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen the 
growlands walfish of the swedes it is the whale which for more than two centuries 
past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas it is 
the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean on the 
brazil banks on the west coast and various other parts of the world designated by 
them right whale cruising grounds some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale 
of the english and the right whale of the americans but they precisely agree in 
all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon 
which to ground a radical distinction it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most 
inconclusive differences that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate the right whale 
will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale 
book i folio chapter iii fin back this head i reckon a monster which by 
the various names of fin back tall spout and long john has been seen almost 
in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried 
by passengers crossing the atlantic in the new york packet tracks in the length he 
attains and in his baleen the fin back resembles the right whale but is of 
a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive his great lips present 
a cable like aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting folds of large wrinkles his grand 
distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object 
this fin is some three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinder part 
of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even 
if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will 
at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface when the sea is moderately calm 
and slightly marked with spherical ripples and this gnomon like fin stands up and casts 
shadows upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding 
it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hour lines graved on it 
on that ahaz dial the shadow often goes back the fin back is not gregarious 
he seems a whale hater as some men are man haters very shy always going 
solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters his straight 
and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted 
with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit from 
man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race bearing for his 
mark that style upon his back from having the baleen in his mouth the fin 
back is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales 
that is whales with baleen of these so called whalebone whales there would seem to 
be several varieties most of which however are little known broad nosed whales and beaked 
whales pike headed whales bunched whales under jawed whales and rostrated whales are the names 
for a few sorts in connection with this appellative of whales it is of great 
importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to 
some kind of whales yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of 
the leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that 
those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for 
a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions which the whale in 
his kinds presents how then the baleen hump back fin and teeth these are things 
whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what 
may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars thus the 
sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases 
then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these has baleen but 
there again the similitude ceases and it is just the same with the other parts 
above mentioned in various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the 
case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy 
all general methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one of the 
whale naturalists has split but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts 
of the whale in his at least we shall be able to hit the right 
classification nay what thing for example is there in the greenland anatomy more striking than 
his baleen yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to 
classify the greenland whale and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans 
why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer 
as those external ones already enumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of 
the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way and 
this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can 
possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceed book i folio chapter iv hump 
back whale is often seen on the northern american coast he has been frequently captured 
there and towed into harbor he has a great pack on him like a peddler 
or you might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular 
name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a 
hump though a smaller one his oil is not very valuable he has baleen he 
is the most gamesome and light hearted of all the whales making more gay foam 
and white water generally than any other of them book i folio chapter v razor 
back this whale little is known but his name i have seen him at a 
distance off cape horn of a retiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers though 
no coward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back which 
rises in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him 
nor does anybody else book i folio chapter vi sulphur bottom retiring gentleman with a 
brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tiles in some of his profounder 
divings he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the 
remoter southern seas and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance 
he is never chased he would run away with rope walks of line prodigies are 
told of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothing more that is true of 
ye nor can the oldest nantucketer thus ends book i folio and now begins book 
ii octavo octavoes embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which present may be numbered 
the grampus ii the black fish iii the narwhale iv the thrasher v the killer 
why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain because while 
the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain 
a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the quarto volume in its dimensioned form 
does not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume does book 
ii octavo chapter i grampus this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has 
furnished a proverb to landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet 
is he not popularly classed among whales but possessing all the grand distinctive features of 
the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one he is of moderate octavo size 
varying from fifteen to twenty five feet in length and of corresponding dimensions round the 
waist he swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable 
in quantity and pretty good for light by some fishermen his approach is regarded as 
premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale book ii octavo chapter ii black 
fish give the popular names for all these fish for generally they are the best 
where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so and suggest 
another i do so now touching the black fish so called because blackness is the 
rule among almost all whales so call him the hyena whale if you please his 
voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips 
are curved upwards he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale averages 
some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almost all latitudes he 
has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which looks something 
like a roman nose when not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture 
the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic some frugal 
housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead 
of odorous wax though their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield 
you upwards of thirty gallons of oil book ii octavo chapter iii narwhale that is 
nostril whale instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose from his peculiar 
horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the creature is some sixteen feet in 
length while its horn averages five feet though some exceed ten and even attain to 
fifteen feet strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the 
jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only found 
on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner something analogous to 
the aspect of a clumsy left handed man what precise purpose this ivory horn or 
lance answers it would be hard to say it does not seem to be used 
like the blade of the sword fish and bill fish though some sailors tell me 
that the narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the 
sea for food charley coffin said it was used for an ice piercer for the 
narwhale rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice 
thrusts his horn up and so breaks through but you cannot prove either of these 
surmises to be correct my own opinion is that however this one sided horn may 
really be used by the that may would certainly be very convenient to him for 
a folder in reading pamphlets the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the 
horned whale and the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism 
to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain cloistered old authors 
i have gathered that this same sea horn was in ancient days regarded as the 
great antidote against poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices it was 
also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns 
of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it was in itself accounted an 
object of great curiosity black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return 
from that voyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from 
a window of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down the thames sir martin 
returned from that voyage saith black letter bended knees he presented to her highness a 
prodigious long horn of the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the 
castle at windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knees 
did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the 
unicorn nature the narwhale has a very picturesque leopard like look being of a milk 
white ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black his oil is very 
superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted 
he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas book ii octavo chapter iv killer this 
whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed 
naturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say that 
he was about the bigness of a grampus he is very sort of feegee fish 
he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a 
leech till the mighty brute is worried to death the killer is never hunted i 
never heard what sort of oil he has exception might be taken to the name 
bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness for we are all killers 
on land and on sea bonapartes and sharks included book ii octavo chapter v thrasher 
gentleman is famous for his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his 
foes he mounts the folio back and as he swims he works his passage by 
flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process still 
less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both are outlaws even in 
the lawless seas thus ends book ii octavo and begins book iii duodecimo duodecimoes include 
the smaller whales i the huzza porpoise ii the algerine porpoise iii the mealy mouthed 
porpoise to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly 
seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among 
word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creatures 
set down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of 
what a whale i e a spouting fish with a horizontal tail book iii duodecimo 
chapter 1 huzza porpoise is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe the 
name is of my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises 
and something must be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always 
swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like 
caps in a fourth of july crowd their appearance is generally hailed with delight by 
the mariner full of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward 
they are the lads that always live before the wind they are accounted a lucky 
omen if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven 
help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye a well fed plump 
huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil but the fine and 
delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable it is in request among jewellers 
and watchmakers sailors put it on their hones porpoise meat is good eating you know 
it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts indeed his spout is 
so small that it is not very readily discernible but the next time you have 
a chance watch him and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in 
miniature book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoise pirate very savage he is only found 
i think in the pacific he is somewhat larger than the huzza porpoise but much 
of the same general make provoke him and he will buckle to a shark i 
have lowered for him many times but never yet saw him captured book iii duodecimo 
chapter iii mealy mouthed porpoise largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific 
so far as it is known the only english name by which he has hitherto 
been designated is that of the whale porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly 
found in the vicinity of that folio in shape he differs in some degree from 
the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of 
quite a neat and gentleman like figure he has no fins on his back most 
other porpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel 
hue but his mealy mouth spoils all though his entire back down to his side 
fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in 
a hull called the waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two 
separate colours black above and white below the white comprises part of his head and 
the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just escaped 
from a felonious visit to a meal bag a most mean and mealy aspect his 
oil is much like that of the common porpoise beyond the duodecimo this system does 
not proceed inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have 
all the leviathans of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive half fabulous 
whales which as an american whaleman i know by reputation but not personally i shall 
enumerate them by their fore castle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable 
to future investigators who may complete what i have here but begun if any of 
the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated 
into this system according to his folio octavo or duodecimo magnitude bottle nose whale the 
junk whale the pudding headed whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon whale 
the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the iceberg whale the quog whale 
the blue whale etc from icelandic dutch and old english authorities there might be quoted 
other lists of uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but i omit 
them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds full of 
leviathanism but signifying nothing finally it was stated at the outset that this system would 
not be here and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that i have 
kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished even as 
the great cathedral of cologne was left with the crane still standing upon the top 
of the uncompleted tower for small erections may be finished by their first architects grand 
ones true ones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever completing 
anything this whole book is but a but the draught of a draught oh time 
strength cash and patience chapter 33 the specksnyder concerning the officers of the whale craft 
this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity 
on ship board arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class 
unknown of course in any other marine than the whale fleet the large importance attached 
to the vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery 
two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged 
in the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an officer 
called the specksnyder literally this word means fat cutter usage however in time made it 
equivalent to chief harpooneer in those days the authority was restricted to the navigation and 
general management of the vessel while over the whale hunting department and all its concerns 
the specksnyder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted 
title of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is 
sadly abridged at present he ranks simply as senior harpooneer and as such is but 
one of the more inferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers 
the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he 
is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstances night watches 
on a whaling ground the command of the deck is also his therefore the grand 
political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men 
before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior though always 
by them familiarly regarded as their social equal now the grand distinction drawn between officer 
and man at sea is first lives aft the last forward hence in whale ships 
and merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and so too in 
most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the 
ship that is to say they take their meals in the cabin and sleep in 
a place indirectly communicating with it though the long period of a southern whaling voyage 
by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar 
perils of it and the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom 
high or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their common 
luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these things do 
in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet 
never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some primitive 
instances live together for all that the punctilious externals at least of the quarter deck 
are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket 
ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter deck with an elated 
grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as 
if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilot cloth and though 
of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that 
sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous 
obedience though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping 
upon the quarter deck and though there were times when owing to peculiar circumstances connected 
with events hereafter to be detailed he addressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension 
or in terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservant of 
the paramount forms and usages of the sea nor perhaps will it fail to be 
eventually perceived that behind those forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself 
incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately 
intended to subserve that certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in a good 
degree remained unmanifested through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship 
for be a intellectual superiority what it will it can never assume the practical available 
supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments 
always in themselves more or less paltry and base this it is that for ever 
keeps true princes of the empire from the hustings and leaves the highest honors that 
this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority 
to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over 
the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks in these small things when 
extreme political superstitions invest them that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they 
have imparted potency but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed 
crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch abased before 
the tremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its 
fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art 
as the one now alluded to but ahab my captain still moves before me in 
all his nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperors and kings i 
must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whale hunter 
like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me oh ahab 
what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies 
and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air chapter 34 the 
cabin table it is noon and dough boy the steward thrusting his pale loaf of 
bread face from the cabin scuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting 
in the lee quarter boat has just been taking an observation of the sun and 
is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallion shaped tablet reserved for that 
daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to 
the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but presently 
catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the deck and in an 
even unexhilarated voice saying mr starbuck disappears into the cabin when the last echo of 
his step has died away and starbuck the first emir has every reason to suppose 
that he is seated then starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along 
the planks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of 
pleasantness mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile 
and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right 
with that important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid 
mr flask follows after his predecessors but the third emir now seeing himself all alone 
on the quarter deck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all 
sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his shoes he 
strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand head 
and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a 
shelf he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the 
deck reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping 
into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent 
hilarious little flask enters king presence in the character of abjectus or the slave it 
is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea 
usages that while in the open air of the deck some officers will upon provocation 
bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those 
very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same cabin 
and straightway their inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he 
sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this 
difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have 
been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane 
grandeur but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own 
private dinner table of invited guests that unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for 
the time that royalty of state transcends for belshazzar was not the greatest who has 
but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be cæsar it is 
a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now if to this consideration 
you superadd the official supremacy of a ship master then by inference you will derive 
the cause of that peculiarity of sea life just mentioned over his ivory inlaid table 
ahab presided like a mute maned sea lion on the white coral beach surrounded by 
his warlike but still deferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waited to 
be served they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed 
not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind their intent eyes all fastened 
upon the old knife as he carved the chief dish before him i do not 
suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation 
even upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out his 
knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby motioned plate 
towards him the mate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly 
and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it 
noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where 
the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin meals were 
somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab forbade not 
conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief it was to choking stubb when 
a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and poor little flask he 
was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party his were the 
shinbones of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks for flask to have 
presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the 
first degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have 
been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say 
ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself the chances were ahab had never 
so much as noticed it least of all did flask presume to help himself to 
butter whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account 
of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long 
a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not 
for him a subaltern however it was flask alas was a butterless man another thing 
flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man 
up consider for hereby dinner was badly jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb 
both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging 
in the rear if stubb even who is but a peg higher than flask happens 
to have but a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then 
flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day for 
it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck therefore it 
was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the 
dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it was to 
be otherwise than hungry more or less for what he ate did not so much 
relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him peace and satisfaction thought flask have 
for ever departed from my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i 
could fish a bit of old fashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to 
when i was before the mast the fruits of promotion now the vanity of glory 
the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the 
pequod had a grudge against flask in official capacity all that sailor had to do 
in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinner time and get 
a peep at flask through the cabin sky light sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful 
ahab now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table 
in the cabin after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the 
canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid 
steward and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary 
legatees they made a sort of temporary hall of the high and mighty cabin in 
strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the table was 
the entire care free license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows 
the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges 
of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there 
was a report to it they dined like lords they filled their bellies like indian 
ships all day loading with spices such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego that to 
fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale dough boy was 
fain to bring on a great baron of salt junk seemingly quarried out of the 
solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go 
with a nimble hop skip and jump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating 
him by darting a fork at his back harpoon wise and once daggoo seized with 
a sudden humor assisted dough memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head 
into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the 
circle preliminary to scalping him he was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little 
fellow this bread faced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse 
and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous 
visitations of these three savages dough whole life was one continual lip quiver commonly after 
seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches 
into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of 
its door till all was over it was a sight to see queequeg seated over 
against tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the crosswise to them daggoo seated on the 
floor for a bench would have brought his hearse plumed head to the low carlines 
at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as 
when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship but for all this the great 
negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such 
comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad baronial and 
superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the 
abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of 
the worlds not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg 
he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in ugly sound much so that 
the trembling dough boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in 
his own lean arms and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to 
produce himself that his bones might be picked the simple witted steward all but shattered 
the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy 
nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their lances and 
other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that 
grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough boy how could he 
forget that in his island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of 
some murderous convivial indiscretions alas dough boy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon 
cannibals not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler in good 
time though to his great delight the three salt sea warriors would rise and depart 
to his credulous fable mongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every 
step like moorish scimetars in scabbards but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and 
nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were scarcely ever 
in it except at mealtimes and just before sleeping time when they passed through it 
to their own peculiar quarters in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most 
american whale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights 
the cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else 
is at any time permitted there so that in real truth the mates and harpooneers 
of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin 
than in it for when they did enter it it was something as a street 
door enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the 
next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air nor did they lose 
much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominally included 
in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he lived in 
the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri and as 
when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the woods burying himself in 
the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so 
in his inclement howling old age soul shut up in the caved trunk of his 
body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom chapter 35 the mast head 
it was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seamen 
my first mast head came round in most american whalemen the mast heads are manned 
almost simultaneously with the leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand miles 
and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground and if after a three 
four or five voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in an empty 
vial her mast heads are kept manned to the last and not till her skysail 
poles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether relinquish the hope 
of capturing one whale more now as the business of standing mast heads ashore or 
afloat is a very ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate here 
i take it that the earliest standers of mast heads were the old egyptians because 
in all my researches i find none prior to them for though their progenitors the 
builders of babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiest mast 
head in all asia or africa either yet ere the final truck was put to 
it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by 
the board in the dread gale of wrath therefore we cannot give these babel builders 
priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians were a nation of mast head standers 
is an assertion based upon the general belief among archæologists that the first pyramids were 
founded for astronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair like formation of 
all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious long upliftings of their legs those 
old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars 
even as the look outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail or 
a whale just bearing in sight in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old 
times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole 
latter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with 
a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander of mast 
heads who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts rain 
hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to the last literally died at his 
post of modern standers of mast heads we have but a lifeless set mere stone 
iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are 
still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight there 
is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stands with arms folded 
some one hundred and fifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks 
below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil great washington too stands high 
aloft on his towering main mast in baltimore and like one of pillars his column 
marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go admiral nelson also 
on a capstan of gun metal stands his mast head in trafalgar square and ever 
when most obscured by that london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero 
is there for where there is smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor 
napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend 
by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised 
that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals 
and what rocks must be shunned it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect 
the mast head standers of the land with those of the sea but that in 
truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy 
the sole historian of nantucket stands accountable the worthy obed tells us that in the 
early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the 
game the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea coast to which 
the look outs ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in 
a hen house a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay 
whalemen of new zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the ready manned 
boats nigh the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to 
the one proper mast head that of a whale ship at sea the three mast 
heads are kept manned from sun rise to sun set the seamen taking their regular 
turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two hours in the serene 
weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast head nay to a dreamy 
meditative man it is delightful there you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks 
striding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and 
between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as 
ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes there you 
stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the waves 
the tranced ship indolently rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor 
for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests you you 
hear no news read no gazettes extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you 
into unnecessary excitements you hear of no domestic afflictions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are 
never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for all your meals for 
three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is 
immutable in one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four voyage as 
often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast head would 
amount to several entire months and it is much to be deplored that the place 
to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural 
life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted 
to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock 
a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small 
and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves your most usual point of perch 
is the head of the gallant mast where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks 
almost peculiar to whalemen called the gallant cross trees here tossed about by the sea 
the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a horns to be 
sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape 
of a watch coat but properly speaking the thickest watch coat is no more of 
a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside of its 
fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out of it 
without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in 
winter so a watch coat is not so much of a house as it is 
a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you cannot put a shelf or chest 
of drawers in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of 
your watch coat concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mast 
heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits 
called nests in which the look outs of a greenland whaler are protected from the 
inclement weather of the frozen seas in the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled voyage 
among the icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the re discovery 
of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in this admirable volume all standers of 
mast heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented nest 
of the glacier which was the name of captain good craft he called it the 
nest in honor of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from 
all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our 
own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so likewise should we denominate 
after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget in shape the nest is something like 
a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with 
a movable side screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale 
being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little 
trap hatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the stern of 
the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas comforters and coats 
in front is a leather rack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope 
and other nautical conveniences when captain sleet in person stood his mast head in this 
nest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle with him also 
fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of 
popping off the stray narwhales or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannot 
successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but 
to shoot down upon them is a very different thing now it was plainly a 
labor of love for captain sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed 
conveniences of his nest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and though 
he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this nest with 
a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from 
what is called the of all binnacle magnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity 
of the iron in the planks and in the case perhaps to there having been 
so many broken down blacksmiths among her crew i say that though the captain is 
very discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned deviations compass observations and errors 
he knows very well captain sleet that he was not so much immersed in those 
profound magnetic meditations as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case 
bottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his nest within easy reach of 
his hand though upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the 
honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he should 
so utterly ignore that case bottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must 
have been while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft 
there in that nest within three or four perches of the pole but if we 
southern whale fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenlandmen 
were yet that disadvantage is greatly counter balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those 
seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float for one i used to lounge 
up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg 
or any one else off duty whom i might find there then ascending a little 
way further and throwing a lazy leg over the top sail yard take a preliminary 
view of the watery pastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destination let 
me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but 
sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how could left completely 
to myself at such a thought engendering could i but lightly hold my obligations to 
observe all whale standing orders your weather eye open and sing out every time and 
let me in this place movingly admonish you ye ship owners of nantucket beware of 
enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to 
unseasonable meditativeness and who offers to ship with the phædon instead of bowditch in his 
head beware of such an one i say your whales must be seen before they 
can be killed and this sunken eyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes round 
the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor are these 
monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whale fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic 
melancholy and absent minded young men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking 
sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast head 
of some luckless disappointed whale ship and in moody phrase ejaculates on thou deep and 
dark blue ocean roll ten thousand blubber hunters sweep over thee in vain very often 
do the captains of such ships take those absent minded young philosophers to task upbraiding 
them with not feeling sufficient in the voyage half hinting that they are so hopelessly 
lost to all honorable ambition as that in their secret souls they would rather not 
see whales than otherwise but all in vain those young platonists have a notion that 
their vision is imperfect they are short sighted what use then to strain the visual 
nerve they have left their opera glasses at home thou monkey said a harpooneer to 
one of these lads been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not 
raised a whale yet whales are scarce as teeth whenever thou art up here perhaps 
they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon 
but lulled into such an opium like listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absent 
minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses 
his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that 
deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange half seen gliding beautiful 
thing that eludes him every dimly discovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to 
him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting 
through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came becomes 
diffused through time and space like sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of 
every shore the round globe over there is no life in thee now except that 
rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by 
the sea from the inscrutable tides of god but while this sleep this dream is 
on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and 
your identity comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover and perhaps at mid 
day in the fairest weather with one half throttled shriek you drop through that transparent 
air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever heed it well ye 
pantheists chapter 36 the quarter deck enter ahab then all it was not a great 
while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab as 
was his wont ascended the cabin gangway to the deck there most sea captains usually 
walk at that hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns 
in the garden soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he 
paced his old rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all 
over dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did you fixedly 
gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger 
foot foot prints of his one unsleeping ever pacing thought but on the occasion in 
question those dents looked deeper even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper 
mark and so full of his thought was ahab that at every uniform turn that 
he made now at the main mast and now at the binnacle you could almost 
see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he 
paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of 
every outer movement mark him flask whispered stubb chick in him pecks the shell soon 
be out the hours wore on now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the 
deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect it drew near the 
close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks and inserting his 
bone leg into the auger hole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he 
ordered starbuck to send everybody aft said the mate astonished at an order seldom or 
never given on ship board except in some extraordinary case everybody aft repeated ahab heads 
there come down when the entire company were assembled and with curious and not wholly 
unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a 
storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his 
eyes among the crew started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were 
nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and half slouched 
hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubb 
cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of 
witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried do 
ye do when ye see a whale men out for him was the impulsive rejoinder 
from a score of clubbed voices cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones 
observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them what 
do ye next men away and after him what tune is it ye pull to 
men dead whale or a stove boat more and more strangely and fiercely glad and 
approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began 
to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they themselves 
became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions but they were all eagerness again as 
ahab now half revolving in his pivot hole with one hand reaching high up a 
shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus ye mast headers have before 
now heard me give orders about a white whale look ye see this spanish ounce 
of gold up a broad bright coin to the is a sixteen dollar piece men 
see it mr starbuck hand me yon top maul while the mate was getting the 
hammer ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his 
jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly 
humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the 
mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him receiving the top maul from 
starbuck he advanced towards the main mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting 
the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming of ye raises 
me a white headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of 
ye raises me that white headed whale with three holes punctured in his starboard ye 
whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce 
my boys huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of 
nailing the gold to the mast a white whale i say resumed ahab as he 
threw down the topmaul white whale skin your eyes for him men look sharp for 
white water if ye see but a bubble sing out all this while tashtego daggoo 
and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest 
and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as 
if each was separately touched by some specific recollection ahab said tashtego white whale must 
be the same that some call moby dick dick shouted ahab ye know the white 
whale then tash he fan tail a little curious sir before he goes down said 
the gay header deliberately has he a curious spout too said daggoo bushy even for 
a parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab he have one two good many iron in 
him hide too captain cried queequeg disjointedly twiske tee be twisk like faltering hard for 
a word and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a cried ahab 
queequeg the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is 
a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of 
our nantucket wool after the great annual sheep shearing aye tashtego and he fan tails 
like a split jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick 
ye have dick ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far been 
eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which 
somewhat explained all the wonder ahab i have heard of moby it was not moby 
dick that took off thy leg told thee that cried ahab then pausing starbuck aye 
my hearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought 
me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with a 
terrific loud animal sob like that of a heart stricken moose aye it was that 
accursed white whale that razed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever 
and a day then tossing both arms with measureless imprecations he shouted out aye and 
chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and 
round flames before i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for 
men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides 
of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out what say ye men 
will ye splice hands on it now i think ye do look brave aye shouted 
the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the excited old man sharp eye for the 
white whale a sharp lance for moby dick bless ye he seemed to half sob 
and half shout bless ye men steward go draw the great measure of grog but 
this long face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not 
game for moby dick am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of 
death too captain ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we 
follow but i came here to hunt whales not my vengeance how many barrels will 
thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it will not fetch 
thee much in our nantucket market market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest a 
little lower layer if to be the measurer man and the accountants have computed their 
great counting house the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts 
of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great 
premium here smites his chest whispered stubb that for methinks it rings most vast but 
hollow on a dumb brute cried starbuck simply smote thee from blindest instinct madness to 
be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab seems blasphemous ye yet little lower layer 
all visible objects man are but as pasteboard masks but in each the living act 
the undoubted some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features 
from behind the unreasoning mask if man will strike strike through the mask how can 
the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale 
is that wall shoved near to me sometimes i think naught beyond but enough he 
tasks me he heaps me i see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice 
sinewing it that inscrutable thing is chiefly what i hate and be the white whale 
agent or be the white whale principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk 
not to me of blasphemy man strike the sun if it insulted me for could 
the sun do that then could i do the other since there is ever a 
sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creations but not my master man 
is even that fair play over me truth hath no confines take off thine eye 
more intolerable than glarings is a doltish stare so so thou reddenest and palest my 
heat has melted thee to anger glow but look ye starbuck what is said in 
heat that thing unsays itself there are men from whom warm words are small indignity 
i meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkish cheeks of 
spotted breathing pictures painted by the sun the pagan unrecking and unworshipping things that live 
and seek and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel the crew man 
the crew are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the 
whale see stubb he laughs see yonder chilian he snorts to think of it stand 
up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot starbuck and what is it 
reckon it but to help strike a fin no wondrous feat for starbuck what is 
it more from this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all nantucket 
surely he will not hang back when every foremast hand has clutched a whetstone ah 
constrainings seize thee i see the billow lifts thee speak but speak aye thy silence 
then that voices thee aside something shot from my dilated nostrils he has inhaled it 
in his lungs starbuck now is mine cannot oppose me now without rebellion keep me 
us all murmured starbuck lowly but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of 
the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from 
the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet 
the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts 
sank in for again downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean 
laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and 
rolled as before ah ye admonitions and warnings why stay ye not when ye come 
but rather are ye predictions than warnings ye shadows yet not so much predictions from 
without as verifications of the foregoing things within for with little external to constrain us 
the innermost necessities in our being these still drive us on measure the measure cried 
ahab receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he ordered them to produce 
their weapons then ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoons in their 
hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest 
of the company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly 
eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot 
eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on 
at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into 
the hidden snare of the indian and pass he cried handing the heavy charged flagon 
to the nearest seaman crew alone now drink round with it round short swallows men 
hot as hoof so so it goes round excellently it spiralizes in ye forks out 
at the serpent snapping eye well done almost drained that way it went this way 
it comes hand it a hollow men ye seem the years so brimming life is 
gulped and gone steward refill now my braves i have mustered ye all round this 
capstan and ye mates flank me with your lances and ye harpooneers stand there with 
your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that i may in some sort 
revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me o men you will yet 
see boy come back bad pennies come not sooner hand it me why now this 
pewter had run brimming again not thou st thou ague ye mates cross your lances 
full before me well done let me touch the axis so saying with extended arm 
he grasped the three level radiating lances at their crossed centre while so doing suddenly 
and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask 
it seemed as though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into 
them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic life 
the three mates quailed before his strong sustained and mystic aspect stubb and flask looked 
sideways from him the honest eye of starbuck fell downright vain cried ahab maybe well 
for did ye three but once take the full forced shock then mine own electric 
thing that had perhaps expired from out me perchance too it would have dropped ye 
dead perchance ye need it not down lances and now ye mates i do appoint 
ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen my 
valiant harpooneers disdain the task what when the great pope washes the feet of beggars 
using his tiara for ewer oh my sweet cardinals your own condescension that shall bend 
ye to it i do not order ye ye will it cut your seizings and 
draw the poles ye harpooneers silently obeying the order the three harpooneers now stood with 
the detached iron part of their harpoons some three feet long held barbs up before 
him me not with that keen steel cant them cant them over know ye not 
the goblet end turn up the socket so so now ye cup bearers advance the 
irons take them hold them while i fill forthwith slowly going from one officer to 
the other he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter three 
to three ye stand commend the murderous chalices bestow them ye who are now made 
parties to this indissoluble league ha starbuck but the deed is done yon ratifying sun 
now waits to sit upon it drink ye harpooneers drink and swear ye men that 
man the deathful to moby dick god hunt us all if we do not hunt 
moby dick to his death the long barbed steel goblets were lifted and to cries 
and maledictions against the white whale the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss 
starbuck paled and turned and shivered once more and finally the replenished pewter went the 
rounds among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all dispersed 
and ahab retired within his cabin chapter 37 sunset the cabin by the stern windows 
ahab sitting alone and gazing out i leave a white and turbid wake pale waters

i ishmael was one of that crew my shouts had gone up with the rest 
my oath had been welded with theirs and stronger i shouted and more did i 
hammer and clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul a wild mystical 
sympathetical feeling was in me quenchless feud seemed mine with greedy ears i learned the 
history of that murderous monster against whom i and all the others had taken our 
oaths of violence and revenge for some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied 
secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale fishermen 
but not all of them knew of his existence only a few of them comparatively 
had knowingly seen him while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given 
battle to him was small indeed for owing to the large number of whale cruisers 
the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference many of them adventurously 
pushing their quest along solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth 
or more on a stretch to encounter a single news telling sail of any sort 
the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the times of sailing from 
home all these with other circumstances direct and indirect long obstructed the spread through the 
whole world wide whaling fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick it was 
hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have encountered at such or such 
a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude 
and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailants had completely escaped them 
to some minds it was not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in 
question must have been no other than moby dick yet as of late the sperm 
whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity cunning 
and malice in the monster attacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantly 
gave battle to moby dick such hunters perhaps for the most part were content to 
ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more as it were to the perils of the 
sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual cause in that way mostly the 
disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded and as for 
those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance caught sight of him in 
the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost as boldly and 
fearlessly lowered for him as for any other whale of that species but at length 
such calamities did ensue in these restricted to sprained wrists and ankles broken limbs or 
devouring fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and 
piling their terrors upon moby dick those things had gone far to shake the fortitude 
of many brave hunters to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come 
nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify 
the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow 
out of the very body of all surprising terrible events the smitten tree gives birth 
to its fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma 
wild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and 
as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every 
other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes 
circulate there for not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and 
superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the 
most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to 
face they not only eye its greatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to 
them alone in such remotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed 
a thousand shores you would not come to any chiseled hearth stone or aught hospitable 
beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too such a 
calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his 
fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth no wonder then that ever gathering volume from 
the mere transit over the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale 
did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and half formed 
fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from 
anything that visibly appears so that in many cases such a panic did he finally 
strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the white whale 
few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw but there 
were still other and more vital practical influences at work not even at the present 
day has the original prestige of the sperm whale as fearfully distinguished from all other 
species of the leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body 
there are those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous enough in offering 
battle to the greenland or right whale would from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity 
decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are plenty of whalemen 
especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the american flag who have never hostilely 
encountered the sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the 
ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their hatches these men will hearken 
with a childish fireside interest and awe to the wild strange tales of southern whaling 
nor is the pre eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended 
than on board of those prows which stem him and as if the now tested 
reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it we 
find some book and the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every 
other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to 
be athirst for human blood nor even down to so late a time as were 
these or almost similar impressions effaced for in his natural history the baron himself affirms 
that at sight of the sperm whale all fish sharks included are with the most 
lively terrors and in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with 
such violence as to cause instantaneous death and however the general experiences in the fishery 
may amend such reports as these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty 
item of povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation 
revived in the minds of the hunters so that overawed by the rumors and portents 
concerning him not a few of the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the 
earlier days of the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long 
practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare such 
men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point 
lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man that 
to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this 
head there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted nevertheless some there were who 
even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to moby dick 
and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely 
without the specific details of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy 
not to flee from the battle if offered one of the wild suggestions referred to 
as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of 
the superstitiously inclined was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he had 
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time nor 
credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether without some faint show 
of superstitious probability for as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never 
yet been divulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the 
sperm whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his pursuers and 
from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them especially 
concerning the mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth he transports himself with 
such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points it is a thing well known 
to both american and english whale ships and as well a thing placed upon authoritative 
record years ago by scoresby that some whales have been captured far north in the 
pacific in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland 
seas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it has 
been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded 
very many days hence by inference it has been believed by some whalemen that the 
west passage so long a problem to man was never a problem to the whale 
so that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigies related in 
old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there was said 
to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface 
and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse whose waters were 
believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage these fabulous narrations 
are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen forced into familiarity then with 
such prodigies as these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale had 
escaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still 
further in their superstitions declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is 
but ubiquity in time that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks 
he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to 
spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in 
unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would once more be seen but 
even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable 
character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power for it was not 
so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales but 
as was elsewhere thrown peculiar snow white wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump 
these were his prominent features the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he 
revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him the rest of 
his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that 
in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale a name 
indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a 
dark blue sea leaving a milky way wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden 
gleamings nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his deformed 
lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror as that unexampled intelligent 
malignity which according to specific accounts he had over and over again evinced in his 
assaults more than all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else 
for when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm he had 
several times been known to turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave 
their boats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship already several 
fatalities had attended his chase but though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by 
no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white infernal 
aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded 
as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent judge then to what pitches of inflamed 
distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips 
of chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the 
white curds of the direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on as 
if at a birth or a bridal his three boats stove around him and oars 
and men both whirling in the eddies one captain seizing the line knife from his 
broken prow had dashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly 
seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom deep life of the whale 
that captain was ahab and then it was that suddenly sweeping his sickle shaped lower 
jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away leg as a mower a blade of 
grass in the field no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay could have smote 
him with more seeming malice small reason was there to doubt then that ever since 
that almost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the 
more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with 
him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations the 
white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which 
some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half 
a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning 
to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe one half of the worlds which the 
ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil did not fall down and 
worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he 
pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and torments all that stirs 
up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the 
sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil 
to crazy ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in moby dick he piled 
upon the white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by 
his whole race from adam down and then as if his chest had been a 
mortar he burst his hot shell upon it it is not probable that this monomania 
in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment then 
in darting at the monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a 
sudden passionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he probably 
but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more yet when by this collision forced 
to turn towards home and for long months of days and weeks ahab and anguish 
lay stretched together in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape 
then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another and 
so interfusing made him mad that it was only then on the homeward voyage after 
the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems all but certain from the fact 
that at intervals during the passage he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of 
a leg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and was moreover 
intensified by his delirium that his mates were forced to lace him fast even there 
as he sailed raving in his hammock in a strait jacket he swung to the 
mad rockings of the gales and when running into more sufferable latitudes the ship with 
mild spread floated across the tranquil tropics and to all appearances the old delirium seemed 
left behind him with the cape horn swells and he came forth from his dark 
den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that firm collected 
front however pale and issued his calm orders once again and his mates thanked god 
the direful madness was now gone even then ahab in his hidden self raved on 
human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled 
it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form full lunacy subsided not 
but deepeningly contracted like the unabated hudson when that noble northman flows narrowly but unfathomably 
through the highland gorge but as in his narrow flowing monomania not one jot of 
broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of 
his great natural intellect had perished that before living agent now became the living instrument 
if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and 
carried it and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that 
far from having lost his strength ahab to that one end did now possess a 
thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one 
reasonable object this is much yet larger darker deeper part remains unhinted but vain to 
popularize profundities and all truth is profound winding far down from within the very heart 
of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here grand and wonderful now quit it 
take your way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman halls of thermes where 
far beneath the fantastic towers of upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful 
essence sits in bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquities and throned on torsoes so 
with a broken throne the great gods mock that captive king so like a caryatid 
he patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages wind ye 
down there ye prouder sadder souls question that proud sad king a family likeness aye 
he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and from your grim sire only will 
the old state secret come now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this 
namely all my means are sane my motive and my object mad yet without power 
to kill or change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he 
did long dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling was 
only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate nevertheless so well did he 
succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no 
nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the 
terrible casualty which had overtaken him the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was 
likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which 
always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage 
sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting 
his fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people 
of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons 
he was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full 
of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within and scorched without 
with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea such an one could he be 
found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against 
the most appalling of all brutes or if for any reason thought to be corporeally 
incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl 
on his underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it 
is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in 
him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all 
engrossing object of hunting the white whale had any one of his old acquaintances on 
shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then how soon would their 
aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man they were 
bent on profitable cruises the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint 
he was intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge here then was this grey 
headed ungodly old man chasing with curses a whale round the world at the head 
of a crew too chiefly made up of mongrel renegades and castaways and enfeebled also 
by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right mindedness in starbuck the invulnerable jollity 
of indifference and recklessness in stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew 
so officered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to 
his monomaniac revenge how it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old what 
evil magic their souls were possessed that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the 
white whale as much their insufferable foe as his how all this came to the 
white whale was to them or how to their unconscious understandings also in some dim 
unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life 
this to explain would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go the subterranean miner 
that works in us all how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the 
ever shifting muffled sound of his pick who does not feel the irresistible arm drag 
what skiff in tow of a seventy four can stand still for one i gave 
myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all 
a rush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest 
ill chapter 42 the whiteness of the whale what the white whale was to ahab 
has been hinted what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid aside 
from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick which could not but occasionally awaken in 
any soul some alarm there was another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him 
which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest and yet so mystical 
and well nigh ineffable was it that i almost despair of putting it in a 
comprehensible form it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me 
but how can i hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random 
way explain myself i must else all these chapters might be naught though in many 
natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beauty as if imparting some special virtue of its own 
as in marbles japonicas and pearls and though various nations have in some way recognised 
a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old kings of pegu 
placing the title of the white above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and 
the modern kings of siam unfurling the same snow white quadruped in the royal standard 
and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow white charger and the 
great austrian empire cæsarian heir to overlording rome having for the imperial colour the same 
imperial hue and though this pre eminence in it applies to the human race itself 
giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this 
whiteness has been even made significant of gladness for among the romans a white stone 
marked a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings this same hue 
is made the emblem of many touching noble innocence of brides the benignity of age 
though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum 
was the deepest pledge of honor though in many climes whiteness typifies the majesty of 
justice in the ermine of the judge and contributes to the daily state of kings 
and queens drawn by milk white steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the 
most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power 
by the persian fire worshippers the white forked flame being held the holiest on the 
altar and in the greek mythologies great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow 
white bull and though to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white 
dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful creature being 
held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings 
of their own fidelity and though directly from the latin word for white all christian 
priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic 
worn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith white 
is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though in the 
vision of st john white robes are given to the redeemed and the four and 
twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne and the holy one 
that sitteth there white like wool yet for all these accumulated associations with whatever is 
sweet and honorable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea 
of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which 
affrights in blood this elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when 
divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any object terrible in itself to heighten 
that terror to the furthest bounds witness the white bear of the poles and the 
white shark of the tropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent 
horrors they are that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even 
more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect so that not the 
fierce fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white shrouded 
bear or shark with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by 
him who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the 
whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened 
hideousness it might be said only rises from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousness of 
the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by 
bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds the polar bear frightens us with 
so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true yet were it 
not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified terror as for the white 
shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary 
moods strangely tallies with the same quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is most 
vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish 
mass for the dead begins with eternal rest whence requiem denominating the mass itself and 
any other funeral music now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in 
this shark and the mild deadliness of his habits the french call him requin bethink 
thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread in 
which that white phantom sails in all imaginations not coleridge first threw that spell but 
great unflattering laureate nature i remember the first albatross i ever saw it was during 
a prolonged gale in waters hard upon the antarctic seas from my forenoon watch below 
i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatches i saw 
a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked roman bill sublime at 
intervals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark 
wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered cries as some ghost 
in supernatural distress through its inexpressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which took 
hold of god as abraham before the angels i bowed myself the white thing was 
so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled waters i had 
lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns long i gazed at that 
prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can only hint the things that darted through me 
then but at last i awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird was this 
a goney he replied goney never had heard that name before is it conceivable that 
this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i 
learned that goney was some name for albatross so that by no possibility could wild 
rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine when i 
saw that bird upon our deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor 
knew the bird to be an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly 
burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet i assert 
then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of 
the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of terms 
there are birds called grey albatrosses and these i have frequently seen but never with 
such emotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl but how had the mystic thing 
been caught whisper it not and i will tell with a treacherous hook and line 
as the fowl floated on the sea at last the captain made a postman of 
it tying a lettered leathern tally round its neck with the time and place and 
then letting it escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was 
taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wing folding the 
invoking and adoring cherubim most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that 
of the white steed of the prairies a magnificent milk white charger large eyed small 
headed bluff chested and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning 
carriage he was the elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in 
those days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies at their flaming 
head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the 
hosts of light the flashing cascade of his mane the curving comet of his tail 
invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver beaters could have furnished him 
a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eyes 
of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when adam 
walked majestic as a god bluff browed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching 
amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it 
over the plains like an ohio or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around 
at the horizon the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his 
cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the bravest indians he was 
the object of trembling reverence and awe nor can it be questioned from what stands 
on legendary record of this noble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which 
so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though 
commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror but there are other 
instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in 
the white steed and albatross what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly 
repels and often shocks the eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own 
kith and kin it is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the 
name he bears the albino is as well made as other no substantive yet this 
mere aspect of all pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion 
why should this be so nor in quite other aspects does nature in her least 
palpable but not the less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces this crowning 
attribute of the terrible from its snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas 
has been denominated the white squall nor in some historic instances has the art of 
human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of that 
passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperate white 
hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the market place nor in some things does 
the common hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of 
this hue it cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect 
of the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering there as 
if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other 
world as of mortal trepidation here and from that pallor of the dead we borrow 
the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them nor even in our 
superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts 
rising in a milk white while these terrors seize us let us add that even 
the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on his pallid horse therefore 
in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness no 
man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition 
to the soul but though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man 
to account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then by the 
citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of for the time either wholly 
or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught 
fearful but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however modified we 
thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause 
we seek let us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety 
and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls and though doubtless some 
at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by 
most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore 
may not be able to recall them now why to the man of untutored ideality 
who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does 
the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless processions of 
slow pacing pilgrims down cast and hooded with new fallen snow or to the unread 
unsophisticated protestant of the middle american states why does the passing mention of a white 
friar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul or what 
is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly 
account for it that makes the white tower of london tell so much more strongly 
on the imagination of an untravelled american than those other storied structures its byward tower 
or even the bloody and those sublimer towers the white mountains of new hampshire whence 
in peculiar moods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of 
that name while the thought of blue ridge is full of a soft dewy distant 
dreaminess or why irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes does the name of the white 
sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lulls 
us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by the 
gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed 
to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of central europe does tall 
pale of the hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the 
is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the blocksburg nor is 
it altogether the remembrance of her cathedral toppling earthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic 
seas nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her 
wide field of leaning spires wrenched cope stones and crosses all adroop like canted yards 
of anchored fleets and her suburban avenues of house walls lying over upon each other 
as a tossed pack of cards is not these things alone which make tearless lima 
the strangest saddest city thou see for lima has taken the white veil and there 
is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarro this whiteness 
keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spreads 
over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions 
i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to 
be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible nor to the 
unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind 
almost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under any form at all 
approaching to muteness or universality what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be 
respectively elucidated by the following examples first the mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of 
foreign lands if by night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and 
feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but under precisely similar circumstances 
let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight 
sea of milky if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round 
him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters 
is horrible to him as a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he 
is still off soundings heart and helm they both go down he never rests till 
blue water is under him again yet where is the mariner who will tell thee 
it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of 
that hideous whiteness that so stirred me second to the native indian of peru the 
continual sight of the snow howdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the 
mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes and the natural 
conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes 
much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference 
views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to 
break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the 
antarctic seas where at times by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of 
frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace 
to his misery views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean 
ice monuments and splintered crosses but thou sayest methinks that white lead chapter about whiteness 
is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a 
hypo ishmael tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of 
vermont far removed from all beasts of is it that upon the sunniest day if 
you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see 
it but only smells its wild animal will he start snort and with bursting eyes 
paw the ground in phrensies of affright there is no remembrance in him of any 
gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he 
smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils for what 
knows he this new england colt of the black bisons of distant oregon no but 
here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the 
demonism in the world though thousands of miles from oregon still when he smells that 
savage musk the rending goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild 
foal of the prairies which this instant they may be trampling into dust thus then 
the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of 
mountains the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies all these to ishmael are 
as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt though neither knows where 
lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints yet with 
me as with the colt somewhere those things must exist though in many of its 
aspects this visible world seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in fright 
but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it 
appeals with such power to the soul and more strange and far more as we 
have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the 
very veil of the deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent 
in things the most appalling to mankind is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows 
forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind 
with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky way or 
is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the 
visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all colours is 
it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in 
a wide landscape of colourless all colour of atheism from which we shrink and when 
we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers that all other earthly stately or 
lovely sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gilded velvets of butterflies 
and the butterfly cheeks of young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually 
inherent in substances but only laid on from without so that all deified nature absolutely 
paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel house within and when 
we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her 
hues the great principle of light for ever remains white or colorless in itself and 
if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objects even tulips and roses with 
its own blank all this the palsied universe lies before us a leper and like 
wilful travellers in lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes 
so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all 
the prospect around him and of all these things the albino whale was the symbol 
wonder ye then at the fiery hunt chapter 43 hark did you hear that noise 
cabaco it was the middle watch a fair moonlight the seamen were standing in a 
cordon extending from one of the fresh water butts in the waist to the scuttle 
butt near the taffrail in this manner they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle 
butt standing for the most part on the hallowed precincts of the quarter deck they 
were careful not to speak or rustle their feet from hand to hand the buckets 
went in the deepest silence only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and 
the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel it was in the midst of this 
repose that archy one of the cordon whose post was near the after hatches whispered 
to his neighbor a cholo the words above did you hear that noise cabaco the 
bucket will ye archy what noise mean it is the you hear sounded like a 
cough be damned pass along that return bucket it is sounds like two or three 
sleepers turning over now have done shipmate will ye the three soaked biscuits ye eat 
for supper turning over inside of else look to the bucket what ye will shipmate 
sharp ears you are the chap ye that heard the hum of the old knitting 
needles fifty miles at sea from nantucket the chap away see what turns up hark 
ye cabaco there is somebody down in the after hold that has not yet been 
seen on deck and i suspect our old mogul knows something of it too i 
heard stubb tell flask one morning watch that there was something of that sort in 
the wind the bucket chapter 44 the chart had you followed captain ahab down into 
his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification 
of his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker 
in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread 
them before him on his screwed down table then seating himself before it you would 
have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye 
and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank 
at intervals he would refer to piles of old log books beside him wherein were 
set down the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various ships 
sperm whales had been captured or seen while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended 
in chains over his head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for 
ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow till it almost 
seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts 
some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of 
his forehead but it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of 
his cabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they were brought out 
almost every night some pencil marks were effaced and others were substituted for with the 
charts of all four oceans before him ahab was threading a maze of currents and 
eddies with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his 
soul now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans it 
might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the 
unhooped oceans of this planet but not so did it seem to ahab who knew 
the sets of all tides and currents and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm 
food and also calling to mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular 
latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching to certainties concerning the timeliest day to 
be upon this or that ground in search of his prey so assured indeed is 
the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm resorting to given waters that many hunters 
believe that could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the logs 
for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated then the migrations of the 
sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring shoals 
or the flights of swallows on this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate 
migratory charts of the sperm whale since the above was written the statement is happily 
borne out by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national observatory washington 
april 16th 1851 by that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in 
course of completion and portions of it are presented in the circular chart divides the 
ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude perpendicularly through 
each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each 
of which districts are three lines one to show the number of days that have 
been spent in each month in every district and the two others to show the 
number of days in which whales sperm or right have been seen besides when making 
a passage from one feeding ground to another the sperm whales guided by some infallible 
rather secret intelligence from the swim in veins as they are called continuing their way 
along a given ocean line with such undeviating exactitude that no ship ever sailed her 
course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these cases 
the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a parallel and though the 
line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary 
vein in which at these times he is said to swim generally embraces some few 
miles in width more or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract 
but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale mast heads when circumspectly gliding along 
this magic zone the sum is that at particular seasons within that breadth and along 
that path migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for and hence not only 
at substantiated times upon well known separate feeding grounds could ahab hope to encounter his 
prey but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by 
his art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to 
be wholly without prospect of a meeting there was a circumstance which at first sight 
seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality 
perhaps though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds yet in 
general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or 
longitude this year say will turn out to be identically the same with those that 
were found there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the 
contrary of this has proved true in general the same remark only within a less 
wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so 
that though moby dick had in a former year been seen for example on what 
is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese 
coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit either of those 
spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there so too with 
some other feeding grounds where he had at times revealed himself but all these seemed 
only his casual stopping places and ocean inns so to speak not his places of 
prolonged abode and where chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of allusion 
has only been made to whatever way side antecedent extra prospects were his ere a 
particular set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become probabilities and as 
ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty that particular set time 
and place were conjoined in the one technical season on the line for there and 
then for several consecutive years moby dick had been periodically descried lingering in those waters 
for awhile as the sun in its annual round loiters for a predicted interval in 
any one sign of the zodiac there it was too that most of the deadly 
encounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves were storied with his 
deeds there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the 
awful motive to his vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which 
ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt he would not permit himself to 
rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might 
be to those hopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize 
his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest now the pequod had sailed from 
nantucket at the very beginning of the season on the line no possible endeavor then 
could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then 
running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise 
there therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season yet the premature hour of 
the sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very 
complexion of things because an interval of three hundred and sixty five days and nights 
was before him an interval which instead of impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in 
a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale spending his vacation in seas far 
remote from his periodical feeding grounds should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian 
gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other waters haunted 
by his race so that monsoons pampas westers harmattans trades any wind but the levanter 
and simoon might blow moby dick into the devious zig zag world circle of the 
circumnavigating wake but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but 
a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if 
encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a white 
bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople yes for the peculiar snow white brow 
of moby dick and his snow white hump could not but be unmistakable and have 
i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter to himself as after poring over his 
charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in him and shall he 
escape his broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost ear and here 
his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness 
of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would 
seek to recover his strength ah god what trances of torments does that man endure 
who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakes 
with his own bloody nails in his palms often when forced from his hammock by 
exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts through 
the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them round and 
round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing of his life spot 
became insufferable anguish and when as was sometimes the case these spiritual throes in him 
heaved his being up from its base and a chasm seemed opening in him from 
which forked flames and lightnings shot up and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down 
among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be 
heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state room 
as though escaping from a bed that was on fire yet these perhaps instead of 
being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were 
but the plainest tokens of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab the scheming 
unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that had gone to his hammock 
was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again 
the latter was the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being 
for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind which at other times employed it for 
its outer vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the 
frantic thing of which for the time it was no longer an integral but as 
the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore it must have been 
that in case yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose 
that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against gods and devils 
into a kind of self assumed independent being of its own nay could grimly live 
and burn while the common vitality to which it was conjoined fled horror stricken from 
the unbidden and unfathered birth therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes 
when what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated 
thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without 
an object to colour and therefore a blankness in itself god help thee old man 
thy thoughts have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes 
him a prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the very 
creature he creates chapter 45 the affidavit so far as what there may be of 
a narrative in this book and indeed as indirectly touching one or two very interesting 
and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in its earlier 
part is as important a one as will be found in this volume but the 
leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon in 
order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound 
ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verity 
of the main points of this affair i care not to perform this part of 
my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations 
of items practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from these citations 
i take conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself first i have personally known 
three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and 
after an interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the 
same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher 
have been taken from the body in the instance where three years intervened between the 
flinging of the two harpoons and i think it may have been something more than 
that the man who darted them happening in the interval to go in a trading 
ship on a voyage to africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated 
far into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years often 
endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas with all the other common perils incident to 
wandering in the heart of unknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also 
have been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with 
its flanks all the coasts of africa but to no purpose this man and this 
whale again came together and the one vanquished the other i say i myself have 
known three instances similar to this that is in two of them i saw the 
whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two irons with the respective marks 
cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish in the three year instance it 
so fell out that i was in the boat both times first and last and 
the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the eye which 
i had observed there three years previous i say three years but i am pretty 
sure it was more than that here are three instances then which i personally know 
the truth of but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity 
in the matter there is no good ground to impeach secondly it is well known 
in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that 
there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has 
been at distant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale became thus marked 
was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales 
for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an 
end to his peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable 
oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there 
hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about rinaldo 
rinaldini insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins 
when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate 
a more intimate acquaintance like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible 
great man they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they 
pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption but not 
only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual you may call it an 
ocean wide renown not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in 
forecastle stories after death but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions 
of a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or cæsar was it 
not so o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long 
lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the 
palmy beach of ombay was it not so o new zealand jack thou terror of 
all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the tattoo land was it 
not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty jet they say at times assumed 
the semblance of a snow white cross against the sky was it not so o 
don miguel thou chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the 
back in plain prose here are four whales as well known to the students of 
cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar but this is not all 
new zealand tom and don miguel after at various times creating great havoc among the 
boats of different vessels were finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and 
killed by valiant whaling captains who heaved up their anchors with that express object as 
much in view as in setting out through the narragansett woods captain butler of old 
had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior 
of the indian king philip i do not know where i can find a better 
place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to 
me seem important as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the 
whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for this is one of 
those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error so ignorant are 
most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that 
without some hints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the fishery they might 
scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a 
hideous and intolerable allegory first though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the 
general perils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid conception 
of those perils and the frequency with which they recur one reason perhaps is that 
not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery 
ever finds a public record at home however transient and immediately forgotten that record do 
you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whale 
line off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the bottom of 
the sea by the sounding you suppose that that poor name will appear in the 
newspaper obituary you will read to morrow at your breakfast no because the mails are 
very irregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what might 
be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet i tell you that 
upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many others we spoke 
thirty different ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some 
of them more than one and three that had each lost a crew for sake 
be economical with your lamps and candles not a gallon you burn but at least 
one drop of blood was spilled for it secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite 
idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever 
found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two fold enormousness they 
have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness when i declare upon my soul i had 
no more idea of being facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the 
plagues of egypt but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon 
testimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm whale is in 
some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in 
utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale has 
done it first in the year 1820 the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket was 
cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spouts lowered her boats and gave 
chase to a shoal of sperm whales ere long several of the whales were wounded 
when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and 
bore directly down upon the ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove 
her in that in less than she settled down and fell over not a surviving 
plank of her has been seen since after the severest exposure part of the crew 
reached the land in their boats being returned home at last captain pollard once more 
sailed for the pacific in command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again 
upon unknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and 
forthwith forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since at this day captain pollard 
is a resident of nantucket i have seen owen chace who was chief mate of 
the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his plain and faithful 
narrative i have conversed with his son and all this within a few miles of 
the scene of the catastrophe the following are extracts from narrative fact seemed to warrant 
me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations he made 
two several attacks upon the ship at a short interval between them both of which 
according to their direction were calculated to do us the most injury by being made 
ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock to effect 
which the exact manœuvres which he made were necessary his aspect was most horrible and 
such as indicated resentment and fury he came directly from the shoal which we had 
just before entered and in which we had struck three of his companions as if 
fired with revenge for their sufferings again all events the whole circumstances taken together all 
happening before my own eyes and producing at the time impressions in my mind of 
decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impressions i cannot 
now recall induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion here 
are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during a black night in an 
open boat when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore dark ocean and swelling waters 
were nothing the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon 
hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to 
a thought the dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale 
wholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance in another 45 speaks of 
the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal secondly the ship union also of nantucket 
was in the year 1807 totally lost off the azores by a similar onset but 
the authentic particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter though from the 
whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions to it thirdly some eighteen 
or twenty years ago commodore then commanding an american sloop of war of the first 
class happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket 
ship in the harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whales the commodore was 
pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen 
present he peremptorily denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloop 
of war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful very good 
but there is more coming some weeks after the commodore set sail in this impregnable 
craft for valparaiso but he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale 
that begged a few confidential business with him that business consisted in fetching the craft 
such a thwack that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest 
port to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but i consider the interview 
with that whale as providential was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a 
similar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense i will now 
refer you to voyages for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer 
hereof langsdorff you must know by the way was attached to the russian admiral famous 
discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth 
chapter the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day 
we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather was 
very clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on 
our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it was not till 
the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an uncommon large whale 
the body of which was larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface 
of the water but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment 
when the ship which was in full sail was almost upon him so that it 
was impossible to prevent its striking against him we were thus placed in the most 
imminent danger as this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet 
at least out of the water the masts reeled and the sails fell altogether while 
we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck 
upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost 
gravity and solemnity captain applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the 
vessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily it 
had escaped entirely uninjured now the captain here alluded to as commanding the ship in 
question is a new englander who after a long life of unusual adventures as a 
sea captain this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston i have the 
honor of being a nephew of his i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage 
in langsdorff he substantiates every word the ship however was by no means a large 
one a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my uncle after 
bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home in that up and down 
manly book of old fashioned adventure so full too of honest voyage of lionel wafer 
one of ancient old found a little matter set down so like that just quoted 
from langsdorff that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such 
be needed lionel it seems was on his way to ferdinando as he calls the 
modern juan fernandes our way thither he says four in the morning when we were 
about one hundred and fifty leagues from the main of america our ship felt a 
terrible shock which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where 
they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and 
indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the 
ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little over we 
cast the lead and sounded but found no ground the suddenness of the shock made 
the guns leap in their carriages and several of the men were shaken out of 
their hammocks captain davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out 
of his cabin lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake and 
seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time 
did actually do great mischief along the spanish land but i should not much wonder 
if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after 
all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath i might proceed 
with several more examples one way or another known to me of the great power 
and malice at times of the sperm whale in more than one instance he has 
been known not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships but to 
pursue the ship itself and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its 
decks the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as 
for his strength let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached 
to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and 
secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a horse walks 
off with a cart again it is very often observed that if the sperm whale 
once struck is allowed time to rally he then acts not so often with blind 
rage as with wilful deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers nor is it without 
conveying some eloquent indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently open 
his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes but i 
must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most 
significant one by which you will not fail to see that not only is the 
most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but 
that these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that for 
the millionth time we say amen with there is nothing new under the sun in 
the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate of constantinople in the days when 
justinian was emperor and belisarius general as many know he wrote the history of his 
own times a work every way of uncommon value by the best authorities he has 
always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some one or two 
particulars not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned now in this history 
of his procopius mentions that during the term of his prefecture at constantinople a great 
sea monster was captured in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed 
vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years a 
fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid nor is there any 
reason it should be of what precise species this sea monster was is not mentioned 
but as he destroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been 
a whale and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale and i will 
tell you why for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been 
always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it even now i 
am certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the present 
constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious resort but further investigations have recently 
proved to me that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence 
of the sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that on 
the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a 
sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles hence a 
sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis 
in the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiar substance called 
brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have every 
reason to believe that the food of the sperm or cuttle at the bottom of 
that sea because large creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have 
been found at its surface if then you properly put these statements together and reason 
upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning sea 
monster that for half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor must in 
all probability have been a sperm whale chapter 46 surmises though consumed with the hot 
fire of his purpose ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view 
the ultimate capture of moby dick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests 
to that one passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and 
long habituation far too wedded to a fiery ways altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution 
of the voyage or at least if this were otherwise there were not wanting other 
motives much more influential with him it would be refining too much perhaps even considering 
his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended 
itself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew 
by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would 
prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed 
exceptionable there were still additional considerations which though not so strictly according with the wildness 
of his ruling passion yet were by no means incapable of swaying him to accomplish 
his object ahab must use tools and of all tools used in the shadow of 
the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew for example 
that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over starbuck yet that ascendency did 
not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership 
for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation 
body and coerced will were so long as ahab kept his magnet at brain still 
he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his quest 
and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it it might 
be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale was seen during that 
long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against 
his leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him not 
only that but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly 
manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that for the present the 
hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested 
it that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure 
background for few courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action that when they 
stood their long night watches his officers and men must have some nearer things to 
think of than moby dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed 
the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less 
capricious and live in the varying outer weather and they inhale its when retained for 
any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in 
the end it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene 
and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash nor was ahab unmindful of another 
thing in times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations but such times are 
evanescent the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought ahab is sordidness granting that 
the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing round 
their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight errantism in them still while for the 
love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food for 
their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old 
times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their 
holy sepulchre without committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious perquisites by the way 
had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic final and romantic object 
too many would have turned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought 
ahab of all hopes of cash they may scorn cash now but let some months 
go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent 
cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier ahab nor 
was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally having impulsively it 
is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the voyage 
ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open 
to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his 
crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to 
him and even violently wrest from him the command from even the barely hinted imputation 
of usurpation and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must 
of course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection could only consist in 
his own predominating brain and heart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attention 
to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected 
to for all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed 
here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to 
the natural nominal purpose of the voyage observe all customary usages and not only that 
but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit 
of his profession be all this as it may his voice was now often heard 
hailing the three mast heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look out and 
not omit reporting even a porpoise this vigilance was not long without reward chapter 47 
the mat maker it was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily lounging about 
the decks or vacantly gazing over into the lead coloured waters queequeg and i were 
mildly employed weaving what is called a sword mat for an additional lashing to our 
boat so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene and such 
an incantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into 
his own invisible self i was the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at 
the mat as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between 
the long yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and as 
queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads and 
idly looking off upon the water carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say 
so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over 
the sea only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed 
as if this were the loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanically 
weaving and weaving away at the fates there lay the fixed threads of the warp 
subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to 
admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own this warp seemed necessity 
and here thought i with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave 
my own destiny into these unalterable threads meantime impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof 
slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly as the case might be and by this 
difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the 
completed fabric this sword thought i which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and 
woof this easy indifferent sword must be chance free will and interweavingly working together the 
straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate every alternating vibration indeed 
only tending to that free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads 
and chance though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity and sideways 
in its motions directed by free will though thus prescribed to by both chance by 
turns rules either and has the last featuring blow at events thus we were weaving 
and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange long drawn and musically 
wild and unearthly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and i 
stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft 
in the cross trees was that mad gay header tashtego his body was reaching eagerly 
forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden intervals he continued 
his cries to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard 
all over the seas from hundreds of look outs perched as high in the air 
but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a 
marvellous cadence as from tashtego the as he stood hovering over you half suspended in 
air so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some 
prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate and by those wild cries announcing their 
coming she blows there there there she blows she blows away the lee beam about 
two miles off a school of them instantly all was commotion the sperm whale blows 
as a clock ticks with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity and thereby whalemen distinguish 
this fish from other tribes of his genus go flukes was now the cry from 
tashtego and the whales disappeared steward cried ahab time dough boy hurried below glanced at 
the watch and reported the exact minute to ahab the ship was now kept away 
from the wind and she went gently rolling before it tashtego reporting that the whales 
had gone down heading to leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in 
advance of our bows for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale 
when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while concealed beneath the surface 
mills round and swiftly swims off in the opposite deceitfulness of his could not now 
be in action for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by 
tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity 
one of the men selected for is those not appointed to the boats by this 
time relieved the indian at the main mast head the sailors at the fore and 
mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed in their places the cranes were 
thrust out the mainyard was backed and the three boats swung over the sea like 
three samphire baskets over high cliffs outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one 
hand clung to the rail while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale so 
look the long line of man of men about to throw themselves on board an 
ship but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye 
from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who was surrounded by 
five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air chapter 48 the first lowering 
the phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side of the 
deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the tackles and bands of the 
boat which swung there this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats 
though technically called the on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter the figure 
that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white tooth evilly 
protruding from its steel like lips a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested 
him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness 
was a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled round and round 
upon his head less swart in aspect the companions of this figure were of that 
vivid tiger yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillas race 
notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariners supposed to 
be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil their 
lord whose counting room they suppose to be elsewhere while yet the wondering company were 
gazing upon these strangers ahab cried out to the white turbaned old man at their 
head ready there fedallah was the half hissed reply away then hear shouting across the 
deck away there i say such was the thunder of his voice that spite of 
their amazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks 
with a wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a dexterous off 
handed daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors goat like leaped down the rolling 
side into the tossed boats below hardly had they pulled out from under the lee 
when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and 
showed the five strangers rowing ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed starbuck 
stubb and flask to spread themselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of 
water but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew 
the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command ahab said starbuck yourselves cried 
ahab way all four boats thou flask pull out more to leeward aye sir cheerily 
cried little king post sweeping round his great steering oar back addressing his crew again 
there she blows right ahead boys back heed yonder yellow boys archy i mind sir 
said archy knew it all before now i hear in the hold and i tell 
cabaco here of it what say ye cabaco they are stowaways mr flask pull my 
fine hearts alive pull my children pull my little ones drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb 
to his crew some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness you break your backbones 
my boys what is it you stare at those chaps in yonder boat tut they 
are only five more hands come to help mind from more the merrier pull then 
do pull never mind the are good fellows enough so so there you are now 
the stroke for a thousand pounds the stroke to sweep the stakes hurrah for the 
gold cup of sperm oil my heroes three cheers hearts alive easy easy be in 
a be in a hurry why you snap your oars you rascals bite something you 
dogs so so so then softly it long and strong give way there give way 
the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallions ye are all asleep stop snoring ye sleepers 
and pull pull will ye pull ye pull ye why in the name of gudgeons 
and ginger cakes ye pull and break something pull and start your eyes out here 
whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle son of ye draw his knife and 
pull with the blade between his teeth it now ye do something that looks like 
it my steel bits start her my silver spoons start her marling spikes exordium to 
his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of 
talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing but you 
must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright 
passions with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief peculiarity he would 
say the most terrific things to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of 
fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the 
fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life and 
yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked 
so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steering oar and so broadly mouthed 
at the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted 
like a charm upon the crew then again stubb was one of those odd sort 
of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on 
their guard in the matter of obeying them in obedience to a sign from ahab 
starbuck was now pulling obliquely across bow and when for a minute or so the 
two boats were pretty near to each other stubb hailed the mate starbuck larboard boat 
there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please returned starbuck turning round not 
a single inch as he spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face 
set like a flint from think ye of those yellow boys sir on board somehow 
before the ship sailed strong strong boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking 
out loud again sad business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never 
mind mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what 
will spring my men spring hogsheads of sperm ahead mr stubb and what ye came 
for pull my boys sperm the play this at least is duty duty and profit 
hand in hand aye i thought as much soliloquized stubb when the boats diverged soon 
as i clapt eye on i thought so aye and what he went into the 
after hold for so often as dough boy long suspected they were hidden down there 
the white at the bottom of it well well so be it be helped all 
right give way men it the white whale to day give way now the advent 
of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats 
from the deck this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some 
of the company but fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them though 
indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event 
it took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this 
and confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from 
superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures 
as to dark precise agency in the matter from the beginning for me i silently 
recalled the mysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim 
nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah meantime ahab out 
of hearing of his officers having sided the furthest to windward was still ranging ahead 
of the other boats a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him those 
tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five trip hammers they 
rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which periodically started the boat along the 
water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who 
was seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed 
his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cut 
against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon while at the other end of the 
boat ahab with one arm like a thrown half backward into the air as if 
to counterbalance any tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as 
in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him all at once 
the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the five oars 
were seen simultaneously peaked boat and crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three 
spread boats in the rear paused on their way the whales had irregularly settled bodily 
down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from 
his closer vicinity ahab had observed it man look out along his oars cried starbuck 
queequeg stand up nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the 
savage stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where 
the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where 
it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale starbuck himself was seen coolly and 
adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently 
eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea not very far distant boat was also 
lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout 
sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the level 
of the stern platform it is used for catching turns with the whale line its 
top is not more spacious than the palm of a hand and standing upon such 
a base as that flask seemed perched at the mast head of some ship which 
had sunk to all but her trucks but little king post was small and short 
and at the same time little king post was full of a large and tall 
ambition so that this loggerhead stand point of his did by no means satisfy king 
post see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on 
to that upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way 
swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal a 
mast head as any sir will you mount i will and thank ye very much 
my fine fellow only i wish you fifty feet taller whereupon planting his feet firmly 
against two opposite planks of the boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his 
flat palm to foot and then putting hand on his hearse plumed head and bidding 
him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous fling landed the little man 
high and dry on his shoulders and here was flask now standing daggoo with one 
lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by at 
any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous 
habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even 
when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross running seas still more strange 
to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances but the sight 
of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious for sustaining himself with 
a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of 
the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxen haired flask seemed 
a snow flake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious 
little flask would now and then stamp with impatience but not one added heave did 
he thereby give to the lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping 
the living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons 
for that meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such far gazing solicitudes the whales 
might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright 
and if that were the case stubb as his wont in such cases it seems 
was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his 
hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed 
home the loading with his thumb end but hardly had he ignited his match across 
the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his harpooneer whose eyes had been setting 
to windward like two fixed stars suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to 
his seat crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry down all and give way 
they are to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have 
been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and 
thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like 
the confused scud from white rolling billows the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as 
it were like the air over intensely heated plates of iron beneath this atmospheric waving 
and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whales were swimming 
seen in advance of all the other indications the puffs of vapor they spouted seemed 
their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders all four boats were now in keen pursuit 
of that one spot of troubled water and air but it bade fair to outstrip 
them it flew on and on as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a 
rapid stream from the hills pull my good boys said starbuck in the lowest possible 
but intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes 
darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring 
binnacle compasses he did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew 
say anything to him only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced 
by one of his peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty how 
different the loud little king post out and say something my hearties roar and pull 
my thunderbolts beach me beach me on their black backs boys only do that for 
me and sign over to you my vineyard plantation boys including wife and children boys 
lay me me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad see 
see that white water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and 
stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon 
the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the stern like a crazed 
colt from the prairie at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with his unlighted 
short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed got fits that 
flask has fits yes give him the very fits into merrily merrily hearts alive pudding 
for supper you know the word pull all but what the devil are you hurrying 
about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and keep pulling nothing more crack 
all your backbones and bite your knives in all take it ye take it easy 
i say and burst all your livers and lungs but what it was that inscrutable 
ahab said to that tiger yellow crew of were words best omitted here for you 
live under the blessed light of the evangelical land only the infidel sharks in the 
audacious seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of 
red murder and foam glued lips ahab leaped after his prey meanwhile all the boats 
tore on the repeated specific allusions of flask to whale as he called the fictitious 
monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his bow with its allusions of his 
were at times so vivid and life like that they would cause some one or 
two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder but this was 
against all rule for the oarsmen must put out their eyes and ram a skewer 
through their necks usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears and no 
limbs but arms in these critical moments it was a sight full of quick wonder 
and awe the vast swells of the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made 
as they rolled along the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling green 
the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tip for an instant on 
the knife like edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatening to cut it 
in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows the keen spurrings 
and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sled like slide 
down its other side these with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and the 
shuddering gasps of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down 
upon her boats with outstretched sails like a wild hen after her screaming brood this 
was thrilling not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the 
fever heat of his first battle not the dead ghost encountering the first unknown phantom 
in the other world of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man 
does who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of 
the hunted sperm whale the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming 
more and more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud shadows flung 
upon the sea the jets of vapor no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right 
and left the whales seemed separating their wakes the boats were pulled more apart starbuck 
giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward our sail was now set and 
with the still rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through 
the water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being 
torn from the row locks soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of 
mist neither ship nor boat to be seen way men whispered starbuck drawing still further 
aft the sheet of his sail is time to kill a fish yet before the 
squall comes white water again to spring soon after two cries in quick succession on 
each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast but hardly were 
they overheard when with a lightning like hurtling whisper starbuck said up and queequeg harpoon 
in hand sprang to his feet though not one of the oarsmen was then facing 
the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on 
the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that 
the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty 
elephants stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist the 
waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents his hump 
there there give it to him whispered starbuck a short rushing sound leaped out of 
the boat it was the darted iron of queequeg then all in one welded commotion 
came an invisible push from astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge 
the sail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by something 
rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us the whole crew were half suffocated as 
they were tossed helter skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall squall whale 
and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped 
though completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed swimming round it we picked up the 
floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our places there we 
sat up to our knees in the sea the water covering every rib and plank 
so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown 
up to us from the bottom of the ocean the wind increased to a howl 
the waves dashed their bucklers together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around us 
like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in 
these jaws of death in vain we hailed the other boats as well roar to 
the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in 
that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew darker with the shadows of 
night no sign of the ship could be seen the rising sea forbade all attempts 
to bale out the boat the oars were useless as propellers performing now the office 
of life preservers so cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures 
starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif 
pole handed it to queequeg as the standard bearer of this forlorn hope there then 
he sat holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness there 
then he sat the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up 
hope in the midst of despair wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship 
or boat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on the mist still 
spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat 
suddenly queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear we all heard 
a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm the sound 
came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge vague form 
affrighted we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view 
bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length 
floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it tossed 
and gaped beneath the bows like a chip at the base of a cataract and 
then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it 
came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed against it by the 
seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on board ere the squall 
came close to the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to 
the ship in good time the ship had given us up but was still cruising 
if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing oar or a lance 
pole chapter 49 the hyena there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange 
mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast 
practical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspects that 
the joke is at expense but his own however nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth 
while disputing he bolts down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard 
things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles 
down bullets and gun flints and as for small difficulties and worryings prospects of sudden 
disaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only 
sly good natured hits and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and 
unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of comes over 
a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it comes in the very midst 
of his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing 
most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke there is nothing like 
the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy 
and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great 
white whale its object said i when they had dragged me the last man to 
the deck and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the 
water my fine friend does this sort of thing often happen without much emotion though 
soaked through just like me he gave me to understand that such things did often 
happen stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oil jacket 
was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain stubb i think i have heard 
you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate mr starbuck is 
by far the most careful and prudent i suppose then that going plump on a 
flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a 
discretion lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off cape horn flask 
said i turning to little king post who was standing close by are experienced in 
these things and i am not will you tell me whether it is an unalterable 
law in this fishery mr flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling 
himself back foremost into jaws you twist that smaller said flask the law i should 
like to see a crew backing water up to a whale face foremost ha ha 
the whale would give them squint for squint mind that here then from three impartial 
witnesses i had a deliberate statement of the entire case considering therefore that squalls and 
capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters of common occurrence 
in this kind of life considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on 
to the whale i must resign my life into the hands of him who steered 
the a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point 
of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to 
our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to driving on to his whale 
almost in the teeth of a squall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous for 
his great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent boat 
and finally considering in what a chase i was implicated touching the white whale taking 
all things together i say i thought i might as well go below and make 
a rough draft of my will said i along you shall be my lawyer executor 
and legatee it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at 
their last wills and testaments but there are no people in the world more fond 
of that diversion this was the fourth time in my nautical life that i had 
done the same thing after the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion i felt 
all the easier a stone was rolled away from my heart besides all the days 
i should now live would be as good as the days that lazarus lived after 
his resurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case 
might be i survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest 
i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience 
sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault now then thought i unconsciously rolling 
up the sleeves of my frock here goes for a cool collected dive at death 
and destruction and the devil fetch the hindmost chapter 50 boat and crew fedallah would 
have thought it flask cried stubb i had but one leg you would not catch 
me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plug hole with my timber toe 
oh a wonderful old man think it so strange after all on that account said 
flask his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing 
that would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the other 
left you know know that my little man i never yet saw him kneel among 
whale wise people it has often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his 
life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whaling captain to 
jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase so soldiers often argued with 
tears in their eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into 
the thickest of the fight but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering 
that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger 
considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties that every 
individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any 
maimed man to enter a whale boat in the hunt as a general thing the 
joint owners of the pequod must have plainly thought not ahab well knew that although 
his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively 
harmless vicissitudes of the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action 
and giving his orders in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually 
apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the all for captain ahab to be 
supplied with five extra men as that same crew he well knew that such generous 
conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the pequod therefore he had not 
solicited a crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on 
that head nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter 
until published discovery the sailors had little foreseen it though to be sure when after 
being a little while out of port all hands had concluded the customary business of 
fitting the whaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and then 
found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole pins with his own hands for 
what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even solicitously cutting the 
small wooden skewers which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove 
in the bow when all this was observed in him and particularly his solicitude in 
having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to 
make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety 
he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is sometimes 
called the horizontal piece in the bow for bracing the knee against in darting or 
stabbing at the whale when it was observed how often he stood up in that 
boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi circular depression in the cleat and 
with the chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all 
these things i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but almost 
everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view 
to the ultimate chase of moby dick for he had already revealed his intention to 
hunt that mortal monster in person but such a supposition did by no means involve 
the remotest suspicion as to any crew being assigned to that boat now with the 
subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonders soon wane 
besides now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from 
the unknown nooks and ash holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of 
whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about 
the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whaleboats canoes blown off japanese junks 
and what not that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into 
the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable excitement 
in the forecastle but be all this as it may certain it is that while 
the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were 
somehow distinct from them yet that hair turbaned fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the 
last whence he came in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccountable 
tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with peculiar fortunes nay so far as 
to have some sort of a half hinted influence heaven knows but it might have 
been even authority over him all this none knew but one cannot sustain an indifferent 
air concerning fedallah he was such a creature as civilized domestic people in the temperate 
zone only see in their dreams and that but dimly but the like of whom 
now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic communities especially the oriental isles to the 
east of the insulated immemorial unalterable countries which even in these modern days still preserve 
much of the ghostly aboriginalness of primal generations when the memory of the first man 
was a distinct recollection and all men his descendants unknowing whence he came eyed each 
other as real phantoms and asked of the sun and the moon why they were 
created and to what end when though according to genesis the angels indeed consorted with 
the daughters of men the devils also add the uncanonical rabbins indulged in mundane amours 
chapter 51 the spirit spout days weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory pequod 
had slowly swept across four several cruising grounds that off the azores off the cape 
de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth of the rio de 
la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from st helena it 
was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night when all 
the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver and by their soft suffusing seethings made 
what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery 
jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up 
by the moon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the 
sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight nights it was his wont 
to mount to the main mast head and stand a look out there with the 
same precision as if it had been day and yet though herds of whales were 
seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them 
you may think with what emotions then the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft 
at such unusual hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky but when 
after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound 
when after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moon lit 
jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted 
in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew she blows had the trump of judgment 
blown they could not have quivered more yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure 
for though it was a most unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and 
so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering walking the 
deck with quick side lunging strides ahab commanded the sails and royals to be set 
and every stunsail spread the best man in the ship must take the helm then 
with every mast head manned the piled up craft rolled down before the wind the 
strange upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails 
made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet while still she 
rushed along as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in to mount direct to heaven 
the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched face that 
night you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring while 
his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck every stroke of his dead 
limb sounded like a coffin tap on life and death this old man walked but 
though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager 
glances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night every sailor swore 
he saw it once but not a second time this midnight spout had almost grown 
a forgotten thing when some days after lo at the same silent hour it was 
again announced again it was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it 
once more it disappeared as if it had never been and so it served us 
night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jetted 
into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be disappearing again for one 
whole day or two days or three and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to 
be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever 
alluring us on nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance with 
the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested the pequod were there wanting 
some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried at however remote times 
or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast by one 
self same whale and that whale moby dick for a time there reigned too a 
sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition as if it were treacherously beckoning us 
on and on in order that the monster might turn round upon us and rend 
us at last in the remotest and most savage seas these temporary apprehensions so vague 
but so awful derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in 
which beneath all its blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm as for 
days and days we voyaged along through seas so wearily lonesomely mild that all space 
in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urn like 
prow but at last when turning to the eastward the cape winds began howling around 
us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are there when 
the ivory tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in 
her madness till like showers of silver chips the foam flakes flew over her bulwarks 
then all this desolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sights more 
dismal than before close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and 
thither before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea ravens and every 
morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and spite of our 
hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our 
ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roosting place 
for their homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea as 
if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish 
and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred cape of good hope 
do they call ye rather cape tormentoso as called of yore for long allured by 
the perfidious silences that before had attended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented 
sea where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish seemed condemned to swim 
on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon 
but calm snow white and unvarying still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky 
still beckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried during 
all this blackness of the elements ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual 
command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than 
ever addressed his mates in tempestuous times like these after everything above and aloft has 
been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the 
gale then captain and crew become practical fatalists so with his ivory leg inserted into 
its accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab for hours and 
hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow 
would all but congeal his very eyelashes together meantime the crew driven from the forward 
part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood 
in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to guard against 
the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to 
the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt few or no words 
were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day 
after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves 
by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still 
in silence the men swung in the bowlines still wordless ahab stood up to the 
blast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in 
his hammock never could starbuck forget the old aspect when one night going down into 
the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sitting 
straight in his floor screwed chair the rain and half melted sleet of the storm 
from which he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat 
and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides 
and currents which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly clenched 
hand though the body was erect the head was thrown back so that the closed 
eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell tale that swung from a beam 
in the ceiling the cabin compass is called the tell tale because without going to 
the compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself of the course 
of the ship terrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this gale 
still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose chapter 52 the albatross south eastward from the cape 
off the distant crozetts a good cruising ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead 
the goney albatross by name as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at 
the fore mast head i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to 
a tyro in the far ocean whaler at sea and long absent from home as 
if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a 
stranded walrus all down her sides this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of 
reddened rust while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of 
trees furred over with hoar frost only her lower sails were set a wild sight 
it was to see her long bearded look outs at those three mast heads they 
seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment that had 
survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they 
swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glided close 
under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each other 
that we might almost have leaped from the mast heads of one ship to those 
of the other yet those forlorn looking fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said 
not one word to our own look outs while the quarter deck hail was being 
heard from below ahoy have ye seen the white whale but as the strange captain 
leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the act of putting his trumpet to his 
mouth it somehow fell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising 
amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it meantime his ship was 
still increasing the distance between while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod 
were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the 
white name to another ship ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though 
he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind 
forbade but taking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and knowing 
by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and shortly bound home he 
loudly there this is the pequod bound round the world tell them to address all 
future letters to the pacific ocean and this time three years if i am not 
at home tell them to address them to at that moment the two wakes were 
fairly crossed and instantly then in accordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless 
fish that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side darted away 
with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselves fore and aft with the flanks though 
in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar 
sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings away from me 
do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water there seemed but little in the 
words but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man 
had ever before evinced but turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding 
the ship in the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old 
lion voice helm keep her off round the world round the world there is much 
in that sound to inspire proud feelings but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct only 
through numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that we left 
behind secure were all the time before us were this world an endless plain and 
by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet 
and strange than any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there were promise in 
the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in tormented 
chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims before all human hearts 
while chasing such over this round globe they either lead us on in barren mazes 
or midway leave us whelmed chapter 53 the gam the ostensible reason why ahab did 
not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and 
sea betokened storms but even had this not been the case he would not after 
all perhaps have boarded by his subsequent conduct on similar so it had been that 
by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he 
put for as it eventually turned out he cared not to consort even for five 
minutes with any stranger captain except he could contribute some of that information he so 
absorbingly sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of 
the peculiar usages of whaling vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas and especially 
on a common cruising ground if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york 
state or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering each other in 
such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of them cannot well avoid a mutual 
salutation and stopping for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for 
a while and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable 
pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whaling vessels descrying each other at 
the ends of the lone island or the far away mills how much more natural 
i say that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails but come 
into still closer more friendly and sociable contact and especially would this seem to be 
a matter of course in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose 
captains officers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other 
and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about for the long 
absent ship the outward bounder perhaps has letters on board at any rate she will 
be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two 
later than the last one on her blurred and thumb worn files and in return 
for that courtesy the outward bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the 
cruising ground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to 
her and in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each track 
on the cruising ground itself even though they are equally long absent from home for 
one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now 
far remote vessel and some of those letters may be for the people of the 
ship she now meets besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable 
chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors but likewise 
with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and 
perils nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is so long 
as both parties speak one language as is the case with americans and english though 
to be sure from the small number of english whalers such meetings do not very 
often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort 
of shyness between them for your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does 
not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english whalers sometimes 
affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer 
with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort of sea peasant but where this superiority in 
the english whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the 
yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than all the english collectively in ten 
years but this is a harmless little foible in the english whale hunters which the 
nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a 
few foibles himself so then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea 
the whalers have most reason to be they are so whereas some merchant ships crossing 
each wake in the mid atlantic will oftentimes pass on without so much as a 
single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace 
of dandies in broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each 
rig as for men of war when they chance to meet at sea they first 
go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings such a ducking of ensigns 
that there does not seem to be much right down hearty good will and brotherly 
love about it at all as touching slave ships meeting why they are in such 
a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible and as 
for pirates when they chance to cross each cross bones the first hail many skulls 
same way that whalers many barrels and that question once answered pirates straightway steer apart 
for they are infernal villains on both sides and like to see overmuch of each 
villanous likenesses but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable free and easy whaler 
what does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent 
weather she has a gam a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that 
they never heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of 
it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about and boilers and such 
like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchant seamen and also all pirates and 
man of men and slave ship sailors cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale ships 
this is a question it would be hard to answer because in the case of 
pirates say i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar 
glory about it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallows 
and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper 
foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude that in boasting himself to be high 
lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand 
on but what is a gam you might wear out your index finger running up 
and down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word dr johnson never attained 
to that erudition noah ark does not hold it nevertheless this same expressive word has 
now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees 
certainly it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with that view 
let me learnedly define it gam a social meeting of two or more whaleships generally 
on a cruising ground when after exchanging hails they exchange visits by crews the two 
captains remaining for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mates 
on the other there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten 
here all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so has the whale fishery 
in a pirate man of war or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere 
in his boat he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned 
seat there and often steers himself with a pretty little tiller decorated with gay cords 
and ribbons but the whale boat has no seat astern no sofa of that sort 
whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed if whaling captains were wheeled about 
the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs and as for a 
tiller the whale boat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming 
a complete crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer 
is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain 
having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like 
a pine tree and often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of 
the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships this 
standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his 
legs nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense 
projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the 
after oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thus completely wedged before 
and behind and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs 
but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him 
because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a spread angle of 
two poles and you cannot stand them up then again it would never do in 
plain sight of the riveted eyes it would never do i say for this straddling 
captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with 
his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant self command he generally carries his 
hands in his pockets but perhaps being generally very large heavy hands he carries them 
there for ballast nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too where the captain 
has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall seize 
hold of the nearest hair and hold on there like grim death chapter 54 the 
town story as told at the golden inn the cape of good hope and all 
the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corners of a 
great highway where you meet more travellers than in any other part it was not 
very long after speaking the goney that another homeward bound whaleman the town ho was 
encountered she was manned almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she 
gave us strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white 
whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town story which seemed obscurely 
to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so 
called judgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men this latter 
circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of 
the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of captain ahab or his 
mates for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the 
town ho himself it was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that 
ship one of whom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy 
but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it 
in that way that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest 
nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the pequod 
who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to 
call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among 
themselves so that it never transpired abaft the main mast interweaving in its proper place 
this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship the whole of 
this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record the ancient whale cry 
upon first sighting a whale from the mast head still used by whalemen in hunting 
the famous gallipagos terrapin for my sake i shall preserve the style in which i 
once narrated it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friends one eve 
smoking upon the thick gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those fine cavaliers 
the young dons pedro and sebastian were on the closer terms with me and hence 
the interluding questions they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time two 
years prior to my first learning the events which i am about rehearsing to you 
gentlemen the town ho sperm whaler of nantucket was cruising in your pacific here not 
very many sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere 
to the northward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps according to daily 
usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common they 
supposed a sword fish had stabbed her gentlemen but the captain having some unusual reason 
for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very 
averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though 
indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was 
possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariners working at 
the pumps at wide and easy intervals but no good luck came more days went 
by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much 
so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the 
nearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired no 
small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance favoured he did not at 
all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pumps were of 
the best and being periodically relieved at them those six and thirty men of his 
could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her 
in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes 
the town ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without 
the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of 
radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and 
desperado from buffalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buffalo said don sebastian 
rising in his swinging mat of grass the eastern shore of our lake erie don 
crave your be you shall soon hear further of all that now gentlemen in square 
sail brigs and three masted ships well nigh as large and stout as any that 
ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the land 
locked heart of our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions 
popularly connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate those grand fresh water 
seas of ours and ontario and huron and superior and michigan an ocean like expansiveness 
with many of the noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races and 
of climes they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles even as the polynesian waters do 
in large part are shored by two great contrasting nations as the atlantic is they 
furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted all round 
their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries and by the goat like 
craggy guns of lofty mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories at 
intervals they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces flash from out 
their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests where 
the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies those same woods 
harboring wild afric beasts of prey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to 
tartar emperors they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland as well as winnebago 
villages they float alike the full rigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state 
the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as 
direful as any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are for out 
of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many a midnight ship with 
all its shrieking crew thus gentlemen though an inlander steelkilt was wild ocean born and 
wild ocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though 
in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to 
nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere 
atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social 
quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitudes of buck horn handled bowie knives 
yet was this nantucketer a man with some good hearted traits and this lakeman a 
mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered 
by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest right thus treated this 
steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all events he had proved so 
thus far but radney was doomed and made mad and gentlemen you shall hear was 
not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for 
her island haven that the town leak seemed again increasing but only so as to 
require an hour or more at the pumps every day you must know that in 
a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic for example some skippers think little of 
pumping their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer 
of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability would be 
that he and his shipmates would never again remember it on account of all hands 
gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you 
to the westward gentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their 
pump handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if 
it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded 
them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the 
way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel 
a little anxious this way had it been with the town ho so when her 
leak was found gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by 
several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the upper sails to 
be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze now this 
radney i suppose was as little of a coward and as little inclined to any 
sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land 
or on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen therefore when he betrayed this solicitude 
about the safety of the ship some of the seamen declared that it was only 
on account of his being a part owner in her so when they were working 
that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going 
on among them as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear 
water clear as any mountain spring bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and 
poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper holes as you well know 
it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of or otherwise that when 
a person placed in command over his fellow men finds one of them to be 
very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives 
an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down 
and pulverize that tower and make a little heap of dust of it be this 
conceit of mine as it may gentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and 
noble animal with a head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the 
tasseled housings of your last snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a 
soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he been born son to 
father but radney the mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn 
as malicious he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it the mate drawing near 
as he was toiling at the pump with the rest the lakeman affected not to 
notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings aye my merry lads a 
lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and have a taste by the 
lord worth bottling i tell ye what men old investment must go for it he 
had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home the fact 
is boys that sword fish only began the job come back again with a gang 
of ship carpenters saw fish and file fish and what not and the whole posse 
of are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements i 
suppose if old rad were here now tell him to jump overboard and scatter playing 
the devil with his estate i can tell him but a simple old soul and 
a beauty too boys they say the rest of his property is invested in looking 
glasses i wonder if give a poor devil like me the model of his nose 
your eyes that pump stopping for roared radney pretending not to have heard the talk 
away at it aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket boys lively now and 
with that the pump clanged like fifty fire engines the men tossed their hats off 
to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes 
the fullest tension of utmost energies the pump at last with the rest of his 
band the lakeman went forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his 
face fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow now 
what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed radney to meddle with such a man 
in that corporeally exasperated state i know not but so it happened intolerably striding along 
the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks 
and also a shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to 
run at large gentlemen sweeping a deck at sea is a piece of household work 
which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening it has 
been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time 
such gentlemen is the inflexibility of sea usages and the instinctive love of neatness in 
seamen some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in 
all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys if boys there 
be aboard besides it was the stronger men in the town ho that had been 
divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of 
them all steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he 
should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties such 
being the case with his comrades i mention all these particulars so that you may 
understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men there was more than this 
the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt 
as though radney had spat in his face any man who has gone sailor in 
a whale ship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman 
fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he sat still for a 
moment and as he steadfastly looked into the malignant eye and perceived the stacks of 
powder casks heaped up in him and the slow match silently burning along towards them 
as he instinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the 
deeper passionateness in any already ireful repugnance most felt when felt at all by really 
valiant men even when nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole over steelkilt in his ordinary tone 
only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him 
saying that sweeping the deck was not his business and he would not do it 
and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as 
the customary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or nothing 
all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous 
manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an uplifted 
club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by and irritated as he 
was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for all his first nameless feeling of 
forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow 
still smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat 
till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his 
face furiously commanding him to do his bidding rose and slowly retreating round the windlass 
steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to 
obey seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest effect by an awful and 
unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but 
it was to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round 
the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had 
now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatches 
and thus spoke to the officer radney i will not obey you take that hammer 
away or look to yourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where 
the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth 
meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions retreating not the thousandth part of an inch 
stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his 
right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the 
hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him but gentlemen the fool had 
been branded for the slaughter by the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the 
next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell 
on the hatch spouting blood like a whale the cry could go aft steelkilt was 
shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were 
standing their mastheads they were both canallers cried don pedro have seen many whale ships 
in our harbours but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are they 
don are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal you must have heard of 
it senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land we know but 
little of your vigorous north well then don refill my cup your very fine and 
ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such information may 
throw side light upon my story three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire 
breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages 
through long dismal uninhabited swamps and affluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiard room 
and bar room through the holy of holies of great forests on roman arches over 
indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or broken through all the wide 
contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk counties and especially by rows of snow white chapels 
whose spires stand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often 
lawless life your true ashantee gentlemen there howl your pagans where you ever find them 
next door to you under the long flung shadow and the snug patronising lee of 
churches for by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters 
that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so sinners gentlemen most abound in 
holiest vicinities that a friar passing said don pedro looking downwards into the crowded plazza 
with humorous concern for our northern friend dame inquisition wanes in lima laughed don sebastian 
senor moment pardon cried another of the company the name of all us limeese i 
but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no means overlooked 
your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh 
do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb all along this as lima 
it but bears out your saying too churches more plentiful than billiard tables and for 
ever as lima so too venice i have been there the holy city of the 
blessed evangelist st mark dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you 
pour out again depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the canaller would make a fine 
dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he like mark antony for days and 
days along his green turfed flowery nile he indolently floats openly toying with his red 
cheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this effeminacy 
is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sports his slouched and gaily 
ribboned hat betoken his grand features a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages 
through which he floats his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities 
once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turns from one of 
these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but it is often 
one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence that at times he 
has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to 
plunder a wealthy one in sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is 
is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whale fishery contains so many of its 
most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so 
much distrusted by our whaling captains nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of 
this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along 
its line the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly 
reaping in a christian corn field and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric 
seas see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles 
need to travel the one lima i had thought now that at your temperate north 
the generations were cold and holy as the hills the story left off gentlemen where 
the lakeman shook the backstay hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by 
the three junior mates and the four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck 
but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the uproar 
and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the 
sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out 
of way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale pike calling upon 
his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarter deck 
at intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying 
into the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of 
his resentment but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded 
in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large casks in 
a line with the windlass these sea parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade out of 
that ye pirates roared the captain now menacing them with a pistol in each hand 
just brought to him by the steward out of that ye cut throats leaped on 
the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do 
but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his death would be the signal for 
a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart lest this 
might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgents 
instantly to return to their duty you promise not to touch us if we do 
demanded their ringleader to turn to make no promise your duty do you want to 
sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he 
once more raised a pistol the ship cried steelkilt let her sink not a man 
of us turns to unless you swear not to raise a rope yarn against us 
what say ye men turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was their response lakeman 
now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye on the captain and jerking 
out such sentences as these not our fault we want it i told him to 
take his hammer away it was business he might have known me before this i 
told him not to prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here 
against his cursed jaw those mincing knives down in the forecastle there men look to 
those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to yourself say the word be a 
fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and your 
men but we be flogged to i make no promises turn to i say ye 
now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him are a few of us 
here and i am one of them who have shipped for the cruise see now 
as you well know sir we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor 
is down so we want a row not our interest we want to be peaceable 
we are ready to work but we be flogged to roared the captain glanced round 
him a moment and then said tell you what it is now captain rather than 
kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal we lift a hand against 
ye unless ye attack us but till you say the word about not flogging us 
we do a turn into the forecastle then down with ye keep ye there till 
sick of it down ye go we cried the ringleader to his men most of 
them were against it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down 
into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave the bare head was 
just level with the planks the captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly 
drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and 
loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway 
then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something down the crack closed it 
and turned the key upon in on deck some twenty or more who thus far 
had remained neutral night a wide awake watch was kept by all the officers forward 
and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it 
was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below but the hours 
of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard 
at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded 
through the ship sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the 
prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was then lowered down to 
them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it when again turning 
the key upon them and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarter deck twice 
every day for three days this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused 
wrangling and then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly 
four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to the 
fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears of 
ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated 
his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to 
stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth morning three others 
of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought 
to restrain them only three were left turn to now said the captain with a 
heartless jeer us up again will ye cried steelkilt certainly said the captain and the 
key clicked was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection of seven of 
his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him and 
maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair 
it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers thus far apparently of one 
mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the 
garrison and armed with their keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a handle 
at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any 
devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he would do this he said 
whether they joined him or not that was the last night he should spend in 
that den but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other 
two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for 
anything in short but a surrender and what was more they each insisted upon being 
the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come but 
to this their leader as fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly as his 
two comrades would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both 
of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at 
a time and here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants must come out hearing 
the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted 
it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking 
out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the 
ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit 
but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last they 
in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secret treacheries together 
and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other 
in three sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords and 
shrieked out for the captain at midnight murder at hand and smelling in the dark 
for the blood he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle 
in a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still 
struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies who at once 
claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder but 
all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by 
side were seized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there 
they hung till morning ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them vultures 
would not touch ye ye villains sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who 
had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the 
former that he had a good mind to flog them all upon the whole he 
would do ought demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would 
let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular as for 
you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in the you i mean to 
mince ye up for the try pots and seizing a rope he applied it with 
all his might to the backs of the two traitors till they yelled no more 
but lifelessly hung their heads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn wrist is 
sprained with ye he cried at last there is still rope enough left for you 
my fine bantam that give up take that gag from his mouth and let us 
hear what he can say for himself a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous 
motion of his cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a 
sort of hiss i say is mind it you flog me i murder you ye 
so then see how ye frighten the captain drew off with the rope to strike 
not hissed the lakeman i must the rope was once more drawn back for the 
stroke here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain who to the amazement 
of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly two or three times and then 
suddenly throwing down his rope said do him him down hear as the junior mates 
were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested the 
chief mate ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning 
hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched 
the whole scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak 
but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared 
not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe are a coward 
hissed the lakeman i am but take that the mate was in the very act 
of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing no 
more made good his word spite of threat whatever that might have been the three 
men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the 
moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as before after dark that day when one watch 
had retired below a clamor was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors 
running up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew entreaties 
cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own instance they were 
put down in the run for salvation still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the 
rest on the contrary it seemed that mainly at instigation they had resolved to maintain 
the strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the ship reached port 
desert her in a body but in order to insure the speediest end to the 
voyage they all agreed to another not to sing out for whales in case any 
should be discovered for spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils 
the town ho still maintained her mast heads and her captain was just as willing 
to lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck 
the cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth 
for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital 
jaw of the whale though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort 
of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all was 
over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him 
in the ventricles of his heart he was in radney the chief watch and as 
if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom 
after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain 
upon resuming the head of his watch at night upon this and one or two 
other circumstances steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge the night radney had an 
unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter deck and leaning his arm 
upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the 
side in this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was a considerable 
vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this was the sea steelkilt 
calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round 
at two in the morning of the third day from that in which he had 
been betrayed at his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in 
his watches below are you making there said a shipmate do you think what does 
it look like a lanyard for your bag but an odd one seems to me 
rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at length before him i think it will 
answer shipmate i enough twine you any there was none in the forecastle i must 
get some from old rad and he rose to go aft mean to go a 
begging to him said a sailor not do you think he do me a turn 
when to help himself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked 
at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was 
given twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely 
netted partly rolled from the pocket of the monkey jacket as he was tucking the 
coat into his hammock for a pillow twenty four hours after his trick at the 
silent to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug 
to the fatal hour was then to come and in the fore ordaining soul of 
steelkilt the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed 
in gentlemen a fool saved the would be murderer from the bloody deed he had 
planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger for by a mysterious 
fatality heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its 
own the damning thing he would have done was just between daybreak and sunrise of 
the morning of the second day when they were washing down the decks that a 
stupid teneriffe man drawing water in the main chains all at once shouted out she 
rolls there she rolls jesu what a whale it was moby dick dick cried don 
sebastian dominic sir sailor but do whales have christenings whom call you moby dick very 
white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don that would be too long a 
story how cried all the young spaniards crowding dons nay i cannot rehearse that now 
let me get more into the air sirs chicha the chicha cried don pedro vigorous 
friend looks faint up his empty glass need gentlemen one moment and i proceed gentlemen 
so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the of the compact among 
the the excitement of the moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his 
voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld 
from the three sullen mast heads all was now a phrensy white white whale was 
the cry from captain mates and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious 
to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and 
with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a 
horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea 
gentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped 
out before the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman of the mate 
and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him while 
radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the 
line at the word of command moreover when the four boats were lowered the got 
the start and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt as he strained 
at his oar after a stiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand 
radney sprang to the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a 
boat and now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the topmost back nothing 
loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two 
whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and 
keeling over spilled out the standing mate that instant as he fell on the slippery 
back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while radney was tossed 
over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through 
the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to 
remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round in a 
sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged 
headlong again and went down at the first tap of the bottom the lakeman had 
slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he 
thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought 
his knife to the line he cut it and the whale was free but at 
some distance moby dick rose again with some tatters of red woollen shirt caught in 
the teeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the whale 
eluded them and finally wholly disappeared good time the town ho reached her savage solitary 
no civilized creature resided there headed by the lakeman all but five or six of 
the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large 
double war canoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor company being 
reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in 
the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak but to such 
unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by 
night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon 
the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that 
the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel after taking 
counsel with his officers he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible loaded 
and ran out his two cannon from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop 
and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man 
with him and setting the sail of his best whale boat steered straight before the 
wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew the 
fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed to have touched 
at a low isle of corals he steered away from it but the savage craft 
bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to 
or he would run him under water the captain presented a pistol with one foot 
on each prow of the yoked war canoes the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring 
him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury 
him in bubbles and foam do you want of me cried the captain are you 
bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkilt lies am bound to tahiti for 
more men good let me board you a come in peace with that he leaped 
from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood face to face 
with the captain your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me as 
soon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonder island and 
remain there six days if i do not may lightnings strike me pretty scholar laughed 
the lakeman senor and leaping into the sea he swam back to his comrades the 
boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa 
nut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at tahiti his own 
place of destination there luck befriended him two ships were about to sail for france 
and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed 
they embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he 
been at all minded to work them legal retribution ten days after the french ships 
sailed the whale boat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the 
more civilized tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small native 
schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed 
his cruisings steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of nantucket the 
widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead 
still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him you through said don 
sebastian quietly am don i entreat you tell me if to the best of your 
own convictions this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful 
did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to 
press bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in don suit 
cried the company with exceeding interest there a copy of the holy evangelists in the 
golden inn gentlemen said don sebastian i know a worthy priest near by who will 
quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advised this 
may grow too serious you be so good as to bring the priest also don 
there are no auto da fés in lima now said one of the company to 
another fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy let us withdraw more out 
of the moonlight i see no need of this me for running after you don 
sebastian but may i also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest 
sized evangelists you can is the priest he brings you the evangelists said don sebastian 
gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure me remove my hat now venerable priest 
further into the light and hold the holy book before me that i may touch 
it help me heaven and on my honor the story i have told ye gentlemen 
is in substance and its great items true i know it to be true it 
happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i have seen 
and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney chapter 55 of the monstrous pictures 
of whales i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without 
canvas something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the 
eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside 
the whale ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there it may be 
worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even 
down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time 
to set the world right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale 
all wrong it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will 
be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures for ever since those inventive 
but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples the pedestals of statues and 
on shields medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain armor 
like and a helmeted head like st ever since then has something of the same 
sort of license prevailed not only in most popular pictures of the whale but in 
many scientific presentations of him now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways 
purporting to be the is to be found in the famous cavern pagoda of elephanta 
in india the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda 
all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any 
of them actually came into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble 
profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth the hindoo whale referred to occurs 
in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form 
of leviathan learnedly known as the matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man 
and half whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that 
small section of him is all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of 
an anaconda than the broad palms of the true majestic flukes but go to the 
old galleries and look now at a great christian portrait of this fish for he 
succeeds no better than the antediluvian hindoo it is picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from 
the sea monster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange 
creature as that nor does hogarth in painting the same scene in his own descending 
make out one whit better the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the 
surface scarcely drawing one inch of water it has a sort of howdah on its 
back and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling might be taken 
for the gate leading from the thames by water into the tower then there are 
the prodromus whales of old scotch sibbald and whale as depicted in the prints of 
old bibles and the cuts of old primers what shall be said of these as 
for the book whale winding like a vine stalk round the stock of a descending 
stamped and gilded on the backs and title pages of many books both old and 
is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature imitated i take it from the like 
figures on antique vases though universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless call this book fish 
an attempt at a whale because it was so intended when the device was first 
introduced it was introduced by an old italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century during 
the revival of learning and in those days and even down to a comparatively late 
period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan in the vignettes 
and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious 
touches at the whale where all manner of spouts jets hot springs and cold saratoga 
and baden baden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the title page of 
the original edition of the of you will find some curious whales but quitting all 
these unprofessional attempts let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober 
scientific delineations by those who know in old collection of voyages there are some plates 
of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages a d 1671 entitled whaling voyage 
to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale peter peterson of friesland master in 
one of those plates the whales like great rafts of logs are represented lying among 
ice isles with white bears running over their living backs in another plate the prodigious 
blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes then again there is an 
imposing quarto written by one captain colnett a post captain in the english navy entitled 
voyage round cape horn into the south seas for the purpose of extending the spermaceti 
whale fisheries in this book is an outline purporting to be a of a physeter 
or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico august 
1793 and hoisted on deck i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken 
for the benefit of his marines to mention but one thing about it let me 
say that it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a 
full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bow window some 
five feet long ah my gallant captain why did ye not give us jonah looking 
out of that eye nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the 
benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake look at 
that popular work animated nature in the abridged london edition of 1807 there are plates 
of an alleged and a i do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly 
whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one glimpse at 
it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could 
be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys then again in 1825 bernard 
germain count de lacépède a great naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are 
several pictures of the different species of the leviathan all these are not only incorrect 
but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale that is to say the right 
whale even scoresby a long experienced man as touching that species declares not to have 
its counterpart in nature but the placing of the cap sheaf to all this blundering 
business was reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous baron in 1836 
he published a natural history of whales in which he gives what he calls a 
picture of the sperm whale before showing that picture to any nantucketer you had best 
provide for your summary retreat from nantucket in a word frederick sperm whale is not 
a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit of a 
whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that picture who can tell 
perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field desmarest got one 
of his authentic abortions that is from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively 
lads with the pencil those chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform us as 
for the sign whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil dealers 
what shall be said of them they are generally richard iii whales with dromedary humps 
and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of 
mariners their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint but these manifold mistakes 
in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all consider most of the 
scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct 
as a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent the noble 
animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars though elephants have stood 
for their full lengths the living leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his 
portrait the living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen 
at sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of 
sight like a launched line of battle ship and out of that element it is 
a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so 
as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations and not to speak of the 
highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full grown platonian 
leviathan yet even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to 
a deck such is then the outlandish eel like limbered varying shape of him that 
his precise expression the devil himself could not catch but it may be fancied that 
from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints may be derived touching his 
true form not at all for it is one of the more curious things about 
this leviathan that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape though jeremy 
skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors correctly conveys 
the idea of a burly browed utilitarian old gentleman with all other leading personal characteristics 
yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any articulated bones in fact as 
the great hunter says the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to 
the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so 
roundingly envelopes it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head as in some part 
of this book will be incidentally shown it is also very curiously displayed in the 
side fin the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human 
hand minus only the thumb this fin has four regular bone fingers the index middle 
ring and little finger but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as 
the human fingers in an artificial covering recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us said 
humorous stubb one day can never be truly said to handle us without mittens for 
all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needs conclude 
that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted 
to the last true one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another but 
none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness so there is no 
earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like and the only 
mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is 
by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of 
being eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you had best 
not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan chapter 56 of the less 
erroneous pictures of whales and the true pictures of whaling scenes in connexion with the 
monstrous pictures of whales i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more 
monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books both ancient and 
modern especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but i pass that matter by 
i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale frederick and in 
the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to is far better than theirs 
but by great odds is the best all drawings of this whale are good excepting 
the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes capping his second 
chapter his frontispiece boats attacking sperm whales though no doubt calculated to excite the civil 
scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and life like in its general effect 
some of the sperm whale drawings in j ross browne are pretty correct in contour 
but they are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault though of the right whale 
the best outline pictures are in scoresby but they are drawn on too small a 
scale to convey a desirable impression he has but one picture of whaling scenes and 
this is a sad deficiency because it is by such pictures only when at all 
well done that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale 
as seen by his living hunters but taken for all in all by far the 
finest though in some details not the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes 
to be anywhere found are two large french engravings well executed and taken from paintings 
by one garnery respectively they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale in the 
first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen 
beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air 
upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks the prow of the boat 
is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon the spine and standing in that 
prow for that one single incomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded 
by the incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping as 
if from a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true 
the half emptied line tub floats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the 
spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about 
the whale in contrasting expressions of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship 
is bearing down upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical details 
of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me i could 
not draw so good a one in the second engraving the boat is in the 
act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale that rolls 
his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock slide from the patagonian 
cliffs his jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so abounding 
a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave supper cooking 
in the great bowels below sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs shell fish 
and other sea candies and maccaroni which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent 
back and all the while the thick lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving 
tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock 
in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle wheels of an ocean steamer 
thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the 
glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and 
the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture 
lazily hanging from the whale pole inserted into his spout hole who garnery the painter 
is or was i know not but my life for it he was either practically 
conversant with his subject or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are 
the lads for painting action go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe and 
where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas as 
in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder fights his way pell mell through 
the consecutive great battles of france where every sword seems a flash of the northern 
lights and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by like a charge of crowned 
centaurs not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea battle pieces 
of garnery the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems 
to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes 
with not one tenth of experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of 
that of the americans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches 
at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt for the most 
part the english and american whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline 
of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as picturesqueness 
of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid even 
scoresby the justly renowned right whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the 
greenland whale and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats us to 
a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives and grapnels and with the 
microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety six 
fac similes of magnified arctic snow crystals i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager 
i honor him for a veteran but in so important a matter it was certainly 
an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a 
greenland justice of the peace in addition to those fine engravings from garnery there are 
two other french engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself durand one 
of them though not precisely adapted to our present purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other 
accounts it is a quiet noon scene among the isles of the pacific a french 
whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails 
of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping 
together in the breezeless air the effect is very fine when considered with reference to 
its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose the 
other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hove to upon the open sea 
and in the very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the 
vessel in the act of cutting in hove over to the monster as if to 
a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about 
giving chase to whales in the distance the harpoons and lances lie levelled for use 
three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole while from a sudden roll 
of the sea the little craft stands half erect out of the water like a 
rearing horse from the ship the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is 
going up like the smoke over a village of smithies and to windward a black 
cloud rising up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the activity of 
the excited seamen chapter 57 of whales in paint in teeth in wood in sheet 
iron in stone in mountains in stars on tower hill as you go down to 
the london docks you may have seen a crippled beggar or kedger as the sailors 
say holding a painted board before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost 
his leg there are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed 
to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being crunched by the 
jaws of the foremost whale any time these ten years they tell me has that 
man held up that picture and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world but the 
time of his justification has now come his three whales are as good whales as 
were ever published in wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump 
as any you will find in the western clearings but though for ever mounted on 
that stump never a stump speech does the poor whaleman make but with downcast eyes 
stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new 
bedford and sag harbor you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling scenes 
graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whale teeth or busks wrought out of the 
right whale bone and other like skrimshander articles as the whalemen call the numerous little 
ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material in their hours of ocean 
leisure some of them have little boxes of dentistical looking implements specially intended for the 
skrimshandering business but in general they toil with their jack knives alone and with that 
almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please in 
the way of a fancy long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man 
to that condition in which god placed him i e what is called savagery your 
true whale hunter is as much a savage as an iroquois i myself am a 
savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready at any 
moment to rebel against him now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in 
his domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian war club or 
spear paddle in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving is as great a trophy 
of human perseverance as a latin lexicon for with but a bit of broken sea 
shell or a tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden net work has been achieved and 
it has cost steady years of steady application as with the hawaiian savage so with 
the white sailor savage with the same marvellous patience and with the same single tooth 
of his one poor jack knife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture 
not quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design as the 
greek savage shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prints of that 
fine old dutch savage albert durer wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of 
the small dark slabs of the noble south sea war wood are frequently met with 
in the forecastles of american whalers some of them are done with much accuracy at 
some old gable roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail 
for knockers to the road side door when the porter is sleepy the anvil headed 
whale would be best but these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays on 
the spires of some old fashioned churches you will see sheet iron whales placed there 
for weather cocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intents 
and purposes so labelled with hands off you cannot examine them closely enough to decide 
upon their merit in bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of 
high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain you 
will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the leviathan partly merged in 
grass which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges 
then again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here 
and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the 
profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges but you must be a thorough whaleman 
to see these sights and not only that but if you wish to return to 
such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and 
longitude of your first stand point else so chance like are such observations of the 
hills that your precise previous stand point would require a laborious re discovery like the 
soloma islands which still remain incognita though once high ruffed mendanna trod them and old 
figuera chronicled them nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace 
out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as when 
long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among 
the clouds thus at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole 
with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me and beneath 
the effulgent antarctic skies i have boarded the argo navis and joined the chase against 
the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish with 
a anchors for my bridle bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs would i could 
mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to see whether the fabled heavens with 
all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight chapter 58 brit steering 
north eastward from the crozetts we fell in with vast meadows of brit the minute 
yellow substance upon which the right whale largely feeds for leagues and leagues it undulated 
round us so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and 
golden wheat on the second day numbers of right whales were seen who secure from 
the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaws sluggishly swam through 
the brit which adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous venetian blind in their 
mouths was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip as 
morning mowers who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long 
wet grass of marshy meads even so these monsters swam making a strange grassy cutting 
sound and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea that part 
of the sea known among whalemen as the does not bear that name as the 
banks of newfoundland do because of there being shallows and soundings there but because of 
this remarkable meadow like appearance caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in 
those latitudes where the right whale is often chased but it was only the sound 
they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers seen 
from the mast heads especially when they paused and were stationary for a while their 
vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else and as 
in the great hunting countries of india the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass 
on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such taking them for bare 
blackened elevations of the soil even so often with him who for the first time 
beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea and even when recognised at last 
their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of 
overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort of life that 
lives in a dog or a horse indeed in other respects you can hardly regard 
any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the 
shore for though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are 
of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of the 
thing this may very well be yet coming to specialties where for example does the 
ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog 
the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy 
to him but though to landsmen in general the native inhabitants of the seas have 
ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling though we know the sea to 
be an everlasting terra incognita so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover 
his one superficial western one though by vast odds the most terrific of all mortal 
disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have 
gone upon the waters though but a consideration will teach that however baby man may 
brag of his science and skill and however much in a flattering future that science 
and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom 
the sea will insult and murder him and pulverize the stateliest stiffest frigate he can 
make nevertheless by the continual repetition of these very impressions man has lost that sense 
of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it the first boat 
we read of floated on an ocean that with portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole 
world without leaving so much as a widow that same ocean rolls now that same 
ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year yea foolish mortals flood is not yet 
subsided two thirds of the fair world it yet covers wherein differ the sea and 
the land that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other preternatural 
terrors rested upon the hebrews when under the feet of korah and his company the 
live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever 
sets but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews 
but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien 
to it but it is also a fiend to its own off spring worse than 
the persian host who murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itself hath 
spawned like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs so 
the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks and leaves them there side 
by side with the split wrecks of ships no mercy no power but its own 
controls it panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider 
the masterless ocean overruns the globe consider the subtleness of the sea how its most 
dreaded creatures glide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden beneath the 
loveliest tints of azure consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its 
most remorseless tribes as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks consider once 
more the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creatures prey upon each other carrying 
on eternal war since the world began consider all this and then turn to this 
green gentle and most docile earth consider them both the sea and the land and 
do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself for as this appalling 
ocean surrounds the verdant land so in the soul of man there lies one insular 
tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassed by all the horrors of the half 
known life god keep thee push not off from that isle thou canst never return 
chapter 59 squid slowly wading through the meadows of brit the pequod still held on 
her way north eastward towards the island of java a gentle air impelling her keel 
so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that 
languid breeze as three mild palms on a plain and still at wide intervals in 
the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be seen but one transparent blue morning 
when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm 
when the long burnished sun glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across 
them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on 
in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo 
from the main mast head in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and 
rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before our 
prow like a snow slide new slid from the hills thus glistening for a moment 
as slowly it subsided and sank then once more arose and silently gleamed it seemed 
not a whale and yet is this moby dick thought daggoo again the phantom went 
down but on re appearing once more with a stiletto like cry that startled every 
man from his nod the negro yelled there again there she breaches right ahead the 
white whale the white whale upon this the seamen rushed to the yard arms as 
in swarming time the bees rush to the boughs bare headed in the sultry sun 
ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to 
wave his orders to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft 
by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo whether the flitting attendance of the one still 
and solitary jet had gradually worked upon ahab so that he was now prepared to 
connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale 
he pursued however this was or whether his eagerness betrayed him whichever way it might 
have been no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass than with a quick 
intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering the four boats were soon on the water 
in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while 
with oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in the same spot where it 
sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby 
dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto 
revealed to mankind a vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing 
cream colour lay floating on the water innumerable long arms radiating from its centre and 
curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as if blindly to clutch at any 
hapless object within reach no perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable token 
of either sensation or instinct but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless chance 
like apparition of life as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck 
still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice rather 
had i seen moby dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white 
ghost was it sir said flask great live squid which they say few whale ships 
ever beheld and returned to their ports to tell of it but ahab said nothing 
turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel the rest as silently following whatever 
superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object certain 
it is that a glimpse of it being so very unusual that circumstance has gone 
far to invest it with portentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and 
all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet 
very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature 
and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food 
for though other species of whales find their food above water and may be seen 
by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in 
unknown zones below the surface and only by inference is it that any one can 
tell of what precisely that food consists at times when closely pursued he will disgorge 
what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid some of them thus 
exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length they fancy that the monster to which 
these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean and that 
the sperm whale unlike other species is supplied with teeth in order to attack and 
tear it there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan 
may ultimately resolve itself into squid the manner in which the bishop describes it as 
alternately rising and sinking with some other particulars he narrates in all this the two 
correspond but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it 
by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature here spoken of 
it is included among the class of cuttle fish to which indeed in certain external 
respects it would seem to belong but only as the anak of the tribe chapter 
60 the line with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described as well 
as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented i have here to 
speak of the magical sometimes horrible whale line the line originally used in the fishery 
was of the best hemp slightly vapored with tar not impregnated with it as in 
the case of ordinary ropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more 
pliable to the rope maker and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the 
sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen 
the whale line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected but as 
most seamen are beginning to learn tar in general by no means adds to the 
durability or strength however much it may give it compactness and gloss of late years 
the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material 
for whale lines for though not so durable as hemp it is stronger and far 
more soft and elastic and i will add since there is an æsthetics in all 
things is much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a 
dusky dark fellow a sort of indian but manilla is as a golden haired circassian 
to behold the whale line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness at 
first sight you would not think it so strong as it really is by experiment 
its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty 
pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons 
in length the common sperm whale line measures something over two hundred fathoms towards the 
stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub not like the 
worm pipe of a still though but so as to form one round cheese shaped 
mass of densely bedded or layers of concentric spiralizations without any hollow but the or 
minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese as the least tangle or 
kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take arm leg or entire body 
off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub some harpooneers 
will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and 
then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the act 
of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists in the english boats 
two tubs are used instead of one the same line being continuously coiled in both 
tubs there is some advantage in this because these twin tubs being so small they 
fit more readily into the boat and do not strain it so much whereas the 
american tub nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makes a rather bulky 
freight for a craft whose planks are but one half inch in thickness for the 
bottom of the whale boat is like critical ice which will bear up a considerable 
distributed weight but not very much of a concentrated one when the painted canvas cover 
is clapped on the american line tub the boat looks as if it were pulling 
off with a prodigious great wedding cake to present to the whales both ends of 
the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an eye splice or loop coming 
up from the bottom against the side of the tub and hanging over its edge 
completely disengaged from everything this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts 
first in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a 
neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to 
carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon in these instances the whale 
of course is shifted like a mug of ale as it were from the one 
boat to the other though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its 
consort second this arrangement is indispensable for common sake for were the lower end of 
the line in any way attached to the boat and were the whale then to 
run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking minute as he 
sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged 
down after him into the profundity of the sea and in that case no town 
crier would ever find her again before lowering the boat for the chase the upper 
end of the line is taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead 
there is again carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon the 
loom or handle of every oar so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing 
and also passing between the men as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales to 
the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a 
wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slipping out 
from the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows and is then 
passed inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathoms called box line being 
coiled upon the box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwale still 
a little further aft and is then attached to the short rope which is immediately 
connected with the harpoon but previous to that connexion the short warp goes through sundry 
mystifications too tedious to detail thus the whale line folds the whole boat in its 
complicated coils twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all the oarsmen are 
involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid eye of the landsman they 
seem as indian jugglers with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs nor can any 
son of mortal woman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricacies and 
while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any unknown instant the 
harpoon may be darted and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed 
lightnings he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in 
his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly yet thing what cannot habit 
accomplish sallies more merry mirth better jokes and brighter repartees you never heard over your 
mahogany than you will hear over the half inch white cedar of the whale boat 
when thus hung in nooses and like the six burghers of calais before king edward 
the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death with a halter 
around every neck as you may say perhaps a very little thought will now enable 
you to account for those repeated whaling few of which are casually this man or 
that man being taken out of the boat by the line and lost for when 
the line is darting out to be seated then in the boat is like being 
seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam engine in full play 
when every flying beam and shaft and wheel is grazing you it is worse for 
you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils because the boat is rocking 
like a cradle and you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest 
warning and only by a certain self adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action 
can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run away with where the all 
seeing sun himself could never pierce you out again as the profound calm which only 
apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself 
for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contains 
it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder and the ball 
and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line as it silently serpentines about 
the oarsmen before being brought into actual is a thing which carries more of true 
terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all men 
live enveloped in whale lines all are born with halters round their necks but it 
is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death that mortals realize the 
silent subtle ever present perils of life and if you be a philosopher though seated 
in the whale boat you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror 
than though seated before your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by 
your side chapter 61 stubb kills a whale if to starbuck the apparition of the 
squid was a thing of portents to queequeg it was quite a different object you 
see him said the savage honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat 
you quick see him whale the next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with 
nothing special to engage them the crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced 
by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through which we 
then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it affords 
fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins flying fish and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters 
than those off the rio de la plata or the in shore ground off peru 
it was my turn to stand at the foremast head and with my shoulders leaning 
against the slackened royal shrouds to and fro i idly swayed in what seemed an 
enchanted air no resolution could withstand it in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness at 
last my soul went out of my body though my body still continued to sway 
as a pendulum will long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn ere 
forgetfulness altogether came over me i had noticed that the seamen at the main and 
mizzen mast heads were already drowsy so that at last all three of us lifelessly 
swung from the spars and for every swing that we made there was a nod 
from below from the slumbering helmsman the waves too nodded their indolent crests and across 
the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all 
suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vices my hands grasped the shrouds 
some invisible gracious agency preserved me with a shock i came back to life and 
lo close under our lee not forty fathoms off a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling 
in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of 
an ethiopian hue glistening in the rays like a mirror but lazily undulating in the 
trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet the whale 
looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon but that pipe 
poor whale was thy last as if struck by some wand the sleepy ship and 
every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score 
of voices from all parts of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft 
shouted forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling 
brine into the air away the boats luff cried ahab and obeying his own order 
he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes the sudden exclamations 
of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down majestically 
turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making 
so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet 
be alarmed ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man 
must speak but in whispers so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the 
boats we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails 
being set presently as we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail 
forty feet into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed 
up go flukes was the cry an announcement immediately followed by producing his match and 
igniting his pipe for now a respite was granted after the full interval of his 
sounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of the boat 
and much nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the 
honor of the capture it was obvious now that the whale had at length become 
aware of his pursuers all silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use paddles 
were dropped and oars came loudly into play and still puffing at his pipe stubb 
cheered on his crew to the assault yes a mighty change had come over the 
fish all alive to his jeopardy he was going that part obliquely projecting from the 
mad yeast which he brewed it will be seen in some other place of what 
a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm enormous head consists though apparently 
the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him so that 
with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does so when going at 
his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front 
of his head and such the tapering cut water formation of the lower part that 
by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a 
bluff bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot boat her start her my 
men hurry yourselves take plenty of start her start her like thunder claps all cried 
stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke her now give the long and strong 
stroke tashtego start her tash my her all but keep cool keep is the start 
her like grim death and grinning devils and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of 
their graves all start her hoo wa hee screamed the gay header in reply raising 
some old war whoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily 
bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager indian gave but his 
wild screams were answered by others quite as wild hee kee hee yelled daggoo straining 
forwards and backwards on his seat like a pacing tiger in his cage la koo 
loo howled queequeg as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of steak and thus 
with oars and yells the keels cut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in 
the van still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smoke 
from his mouth like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was 
up tashtego it to him the harpoon was hurled all the oarsmen backed water the 
same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists it was 
the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it 
round the loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke 
now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe as the line 
passed round and round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it blisteringly 
passed through and through both of hands from which the hand cloths or squares of 
quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times had accidentally dropped it was like holding an 
sharp two edged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to 
wrest it out of your clutch the line wet the line cried stubb to the 
tub oarsman him seated by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed sea water 
into it more turns were taken so that the line began holding its place the 
boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins stubb and tashtego 
here changed for staggering business truly in that rocking commotion partly to show the indispensableness 
of this act it may here be stated that in the old dutch fishery a 
mop was used to dash the running line with water in many other ships a 
wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the 
most convenient from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of 
the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would have 
thought the craft had two cleaving the water the other the the boat churned on 
through both opposing elements at once a continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless 
whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of 
a little finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea 
thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent 
being tossed to the foam and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar 
crouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity whole atlantics and 
pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat 
slackened his flight in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale 
all hands began pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat was being 
towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb firmly planting his knee in the 
clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command 
the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the horrible wallow and then ranging 
up for another fling the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster 
like brooks down a hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood 
which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake the slanting sun playing upon 
this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every face so that 
they all glowed to each other like red men and all the while jet after 
jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement 
puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling 
in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again 
and again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again sent 
it into the whale up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale 
relaxed in his wrath up to and the boat ranged along the flank when reaching 
far over the bow stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish and 
kept it there carefully churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some 
gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of breaking 
ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought was the innermost 
life of the fish and now it is struck for starting from his trance into 
that unspeakable thing called his the monster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in 
impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado 
blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day 
and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging 
from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout hole with sharp cracking agonized 
respirations at last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been 
the purple lees of red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again 
ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea his heart had burst dead mr 
stubb said daggoo both pipes smoked out and withdrawing his own from his mouth stubb 
scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood thoughtfully eyeing the 
vast corpse he had made chapter 62 the dart a word concerning an incident in 
the last chapter according to the invariable usage of the fishery the whale boat pushes 
off from the ship with the headsman or whale killer as temporary steersman and the 
harpooneer or whale fastener pulling the foremost oar the one known as the harpooneer oar 
now it needs a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish 
for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implement has to be 
flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet but however prolonged and exhausting the 
chase the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed he 
is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest not only by 
incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations and what it is to keep 
shouting at the top of compass while all the other muscles are strained and half 
that is none know but those who have tried it for one i cannot bawl 
very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time in this straining 
bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once the exhausted harpooneer 
hears the exciting up and give it to him he now has to drop and 
secure his oar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from the 
crotch and with what little strength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow into 
the whale no wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that out 
of fifty fair chances for a dart not five are successful no wonder that so 
many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some of them actually 
burst their blood vessels in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent 
four years with four barrels no wonder that to many ship owners whaling is but 
a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage and if you 
take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there 
when most wanted again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant 
that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to 
running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else it 
is then they change places and the headsman the chief officer of the little craft 
takes his proper station in the bows of the boat now i care not who 
maintains the contrary but all this is both foolish and unnecessary the headsman should stay 
in the bows from first to last he should both dart the harpoon and the 
lance and no rowing whatever should be expected of him except under circumstances obvious to 
any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in 
the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced 
me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery it has not by 
any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion 
of the harpooneer that has caused them to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart 
the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness and 
not from out of toil chapter 63 the crotch out of the trunk the branches 
grow out of them the twigs so in productive subjects grow the chapters the crotch 
alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention it is a notched stick of 
a peculiar form some two feet in length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard 
gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity 
of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from the prow thereby the 
weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler who snatches it up as readily from 
its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall it is customary to 
have two harpoons reposing in the crotch respectively called the first and second irons but 
these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with the line the 
object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into 
the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the 
other may still retain a hold it is a doubling of the chances but it 
very often happens that owing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon 
receiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightning like in his 
movements to pitch the second iron into him nevertheless as the second iron is already 
connected with the line and the line is running hence that weapon must at all 
events be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible 
jeopardy would involve all hands tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such cases 
the spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in 
most instances prudently practicable but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest 
and most fatal casualties furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown 
overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharp edged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and 
whale entangling the lines or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions 
nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly 
captured and a corpse consider now how it must be in the case of four 
boats all engaging one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these qualities 
in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise 
eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him for of course 
each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the 
first one be ineffectually darted without recovery all these particulars are faithfully narrated here as 
they will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter 
to be painted chapter 64 supper whale had been killed some distance from the ship 
it was a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow 
business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now as we eighteen men with 
our thirty six arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers slowly toiled hour 
after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to 
budge at all except at long intervals good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness 
of the mass we moved for upon the great canal of hang ho or whatever 
they call it in china four or five laborers on the foot path will draw 
a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand 
argosy we towed heavily forged along as if laden with pig lead in bulk darkness 
came on but three lights up and down in the main rigging dimly guided our 
way till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the 
bulwarks vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for 
securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his 
way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning though in overseeing 
the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had evinced his customary activity to call it 
so yet now that the creature was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair 
seemed working in him as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that 
moby dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand other whales were brought 
to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac object very 
soon you would have thought from the sound on the decks that all hands were 
preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the 
deck and thrust rattling out of the port holes but by those clanking links the 
vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to 
the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its 
black hull close to the and seen through the darkness of the night which obscured 
the spars and rigging aloft the and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof 
one reclines while the other remains standing a little item may as well be related 
here the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when 
moored alongside is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that 
part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the side fins its flexibility even in 
death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you 
cannot get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it 
but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden 
float at its outer end and a weight in its middle while the other end 
is secured to the ship by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise 
on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the 
chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at 
last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction 
with its broad flukes or lobes if moody ahab was now all quiescence at least 
so far as could be known on deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest 
betrayed an unusual but still good natured excitement such an unwonted bustle was he in 
that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned to him for the time the 
sole management of affairs one small helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb was 
soon made strangely manifest stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of 
the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate steak a steak ere i sleep 
you daggoo overboard you go and cut me one from his small here be it 
known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general thing and according to 
the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war at 
least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you find some 
of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm 
whale designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body about midnight that steak 
was cut and cooked and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood 
up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan head as if that capstan were a 
sideboard nor was stubb the only banqueter on flesh that night mingling their mumblings with 
his own mastications thousands on thousands of sharks swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted 
on its fatness the few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the 
sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the hearts 
peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them wallowing 
in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out 
huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head this particular 
feat of the shark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface 
they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universal problem 
of all things the mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened 
to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw though amid all 
the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea fight sharks will be seen longingly gazing 
up to the decks like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being 
carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though 
while the valiant butchers over the deck table are thus cannibally carving each live meat 
with carving knives all gilded and tasselled the sharks also with their jewel hilted mouths 
are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat and though were you 
to turn the whole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same 
thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and though 
sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the atlantic systematically trotting 
alongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a 
dead slave to be decently buried and though one or two other like instances might 
be set down touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do most socially 
congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you 
will find them in such countless numbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than 
around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you 
have never seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil worship 
and the expediency of conciliating the devil but as yet stubb heeded not the mumblings 
of the banquet that was going on so nigh him no more than the sharks 
heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips cook that old fleece he cried at 
length widening his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for 
his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if 
stabbing with his lance you cook this way cook the old black not in any 
very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most 
unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old blacks there was 
something the matter with his knee pans which he did not keep well scoured like 
his other pans this old fleece as they called him came shuffling and limping along 
assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened 
iron hoops this old ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word of command 
came to a dead stop on the opposite side of sideboard when with both hands 
folded before him and resting on his two legged cane he bowed his arched back 
still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so as to bring 
his best ear into play said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his 
mouth you think this steak is rather overdone been beating this steak too much cook 
too tender i always say that to be good a whale steak must be tough 
there are those sharks now over the side you see they prefer it tough and 
rare what a shindy they are kicking up cook go and talk to tell they 
are welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must keep quiet blast 
me if i can hear my own voice away cook and deliver my message here 
take this lantern snatching one from his sideboard then go and preach to sullenly taking 
the offered lantern old fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks and then with 
one hand dropping his light low over the sea so as to get a good 
view of his congregation with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning 
far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while stubb softly 
crawling behind overheard all that was said critters ordered here to say dat you must 
stop dat dam noise dare you hear stop dat dam ob de lip massa stubb 
say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings but by gor 
you must stop dat dam racket here interposed stubb accompanying the word with a sudden 
slap on the shoulder why damn your eyes you swear that way when preaching no 
way to convert sinners cook dat den preach to him yourself sullenly turning to go 
cook go on go on den belubed fellow critters exclaimed stubb approvingly to it try 
that and fleece continued you is all sharks and by natur wery woracious yet i 
zay to you fellow critters dat dat dat dam ob de tail how you tink 
to hear spose you keep up such a dam and dare cried stubb collaring him 
have that swearing talk to gentlemanly once more the sermon proceeded woraciousness fellow critters i 
blame ye so much for dat is natur and be helped but to gobern dat 
wicked natur dat is de pint you is sharks sartin but if you gobern de 
shark in you why den you be angel for all angel is more dan de

small bellies so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid but 
to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks dat get into de

same opinion so give the benediction fleece and away to my supper upon this fleece 
holding both hands over the fishy mob raised his shrill voice and fellow critters kick 
up de damndest row as ever you can fill your bellies dey den die cook 
said stubb resuming his supper at the capstan just where you stood before there over 
against me and pay particular attention dention said fleece again stooping over upon his tongs 
in the desired position said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile shall now go back to 
the subject of this steak in the first place how old are you cook dat 
do wid de said the old black testily how old are you cook ninety dey 
say he gloomily muttered you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years 
cook and know yet how to cook a whale steak rapidly bolting another mouthful at 
the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question were you born 
cook de hatchway in ferry boat ober de roanoke in a ferry boat queer too 
but i want to know what country you were born in cook i say de 
roanoke country he cried sharply you cook but tell you what coming to cook you 
must go home and be born over again you know how to cook a whale 
steak yet my soul if i cook noder one he growled angrily turning round to 
depart back cook hand me those tongs take that bit of steak there and tell 
me if you think that steak cooked as it should be take it i the 
tongs towards it and taste it faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a 
moment the old negro muttered cooked i eber taste joosy berry joosy said stubb squaring 
himself once more you belong to the church one once in cape down said the 
old man sullenly you have once in your life passed a holy church in cape 
town where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow 
creatures have you cook and yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful 
lie as you did just now eh said stubb do you expect to go to 
cook to bed berry soon he mumbled half turning as he spoke heave to i 
mean when you die cook an awful question now your answer dis old brack man 
dies said the negro slowly changing his whole air and demeanor hisself go nowhere but 
some bressed angel will come and fetch him him how in a coach and four 
as they fetched elijah and fetch him where dere said fleece holding his tongs straight 
over his head and keeping it there very solemnly then you expect to go up 
into our main top do you cook when you are dead but you know the 
higher you climb the colder it gets main top eh say dat said fleece again 
in the sulks said up there you and now look yourself and see where your 
tongs are pointing but perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the 
hole cook but no no cook you get there except you go the regular way 
round by the rigging a ticklish business but must be done or else no go 
but none of us are in heaven yet drop your tongs cook and hear my 
orders do ye hear hold your hat in one hand and clap of your heart 
when giving my orders cook what that your heart there your gizzard aloft aloft you 
have it hold it there now and pay attention said the old black with both 
hands placed as desired vainly wriggling his grizzled head as if to get both ears 
in front at one and the same time then cook you see this whale steak 
of yours was so very bad that i have put it out of sight as 
soon as possible you see that you well for the future when you cook another 
whale steak for my private table here the capstan tell you what to do so 
as not to spoil it by overdoing hold the steak in one hand and show 
a live coal to it with the other that done dish it hear and now 
to morrow cook when we are cutting in the fish be sure you stand by 
to get the tips of his fins have them put in pickle as for the 
ends of the flukes have them soused cook there now ye may go but fleece 
had hardly got three paces off when he was recalled give me cutlets for supper 
to morrow night in the mid watch hear away you sail then stop make a 
bow before you go heaving again whale balls for forget by gor whale eat him 
of him eat whale bressed if he more of shark dan massa shark hisself muttered 
the old man limping away with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock chapter 
65 the whale as a dish that mortal man should feed upon the creature that 
feeds his lamp and like stubb eat him by his own light as you may 
say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into 
the history and philosophy of it it is upon record that three centuries ago the 
tongue of the right whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large 
prices there also that in henry time a certain cook of the court obtained a 
handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you 
remember are a species of whale porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating 
the meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being well 
seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle balls or veal balls the old monks 
of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great porpoise grant from the 
crown the fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all 
hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when 
you come to sit down before a meat pie nearly one hundred feet long it 
takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb nowadays partake of 
cooked whales but the esquimaux are not so fastidious we all know how they live 
upon whales and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil zogranda one of 
their most famous doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly juicy and 
nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen who long ago were accidentally left in 
greenland by a whaling these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps 
of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among the dutch 
whalemen these scraps are called which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and 
smelling something like old amsterdam dough nuts or oly cooks when fresh they have such 
an eatable look that the most self denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off 
but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness he 
is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good look 
at his hump which would be as fine eating as the which is esteemed a 
rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself 
how bland and creamy that is like the transparent half jellied white meat of a 
cocoanut in the third month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a 
substitute for butter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other 
substance and then partaking of it in the long try watches of the night it 
is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship biscuit into the huge 
oil pots and let them fry there awhile many a good supper have i thus 
made in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine 
dish the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two 
plump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large puddings they are then mixed with 
flour and cooked into a most delectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling head which is 
quite a dish among some epicures and every one knows that some young bucks among 
the epicures by continually dining upon brains by and by get to have a little 
brains of their own so as to be able to tell a head from their 
own heads which indeed requires uncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young 
buck with an intelligent looking head before him is somehow one of the saddest sights 
you can see the head looks a sort of reproachfully at him with an tu 
brute expression it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that 
landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence that appears to result in 
some way from the consideration before mentioned i e that a man should eat a 
newly murdered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light but 
no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer 
perhaps he was hung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen 
he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does go 
to the meat market of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds 
staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds does not that sight take a 
tooth out of the jaw cannibals who is not a cannibal i tell you it 
will be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his 
cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that provident fejee i 
say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest 
geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy paté de foie 
gras but stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that 
is adding insult to injury is it look at your knife handle there my civilized 
and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is that handle made of but 
the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating and what do 
you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose with a feather of the 
same fowl and with what quill did the secretary of the society for the suppression 
of cruelty to ganders formally indite his circulars it is only within the last month 
or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens chapter 
66 the shark massacre when in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after long 
and weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general 
thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in 
for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very soon completed and requires 
all hands to set about it therefore the common usage is to take in all 
sail lash the helm and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight 
with the reservation that until that time anchor watches shall be kept that is two 
and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck 
to see that all goes well but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific 
this plan will not answer at all because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round 
the moored carcase that were he left so for six hours say on a stretch 
little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning in most other parts of 
the ocean however where these fish do not so largely abound their wondrous voracity can 
be at times considerably diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling spades a 
procedure notwithstanding which in some instances only seems to tickle them into still greater activity 
but it was not thus in the present case with the sharks though to be 
sure any man unaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night 
would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and those sharks 
the maggots in it nevertheless upon stubb setting the anchor watch after his supper was 
concluded and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck no small excitement 
was created among the sharks for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side and 
lowering three lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea 
these two mariners darting their long whaling spades kept up an incessant murdering of the 
sharks by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls seemingly their only vital part 
but in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not 
always hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of 
the foe they viciously snapped not only at each disembowelments but like flexible bows bent 
round and bit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by 
the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor was this all 
it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures a sort 
of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones after 
what might be called the individual life had departed killed and hoisted on deck for 
the sake of his skin one of these sharks almost took poor hand off when 
he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw the whaling spade 
used for cutting in is made of the very best steel is about the bigness 
of a spread hand and in general shape corresponds to the garden implement after which 
it is named only its sides are perfectly flat and its upper end considerably narrower 
than the lower this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible and when being

twenty to thirty feet long is inserted for a handle no care what god made

cutting in it was a saturday night and such a sabbath as followed ex officio 
professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen the ivory pequod was turned into what seemed 
a shamble every sailor a butcher you would have thought we were offering up ten 
thousand red oxen to the sea gods in the first place the enormous cutting tackles 
among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and which no 
single man can possibly vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main top 
and firmly lashed to the lower mast head the strongest point anywhere above a deck 
the end of the hawser like rope winding through these intricacies was then conducted to 
the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale 
to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was attached and 
now suspended in stages over the side starbuck and stubb the mates armed with their 
long spades began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook 
just above the nearest of the two side fins this done a broad semicircular line 
is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the main body of the 
crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the 
windlass when instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every bolt in her 
starts like the nail heads of an old house in frosty weather she trembles quivers 
and nods her frighted mast heads to the sky more and more she leans over 
to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping 
heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a 
great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle 
rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of 
blubber now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange 
so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped 
by spiralizing it for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the 
whale rolling over and over in the water and as the blubber in one strip 
uniformly peels off along the line called the simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuck 
and stubb the mates and just as fast as it is thus peeled off and 
indeed by that very act itself it is all the time being hoisted higher and 
higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main top the men at the windlass 
then cease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious blood dripping mass sways 
to and fro as if let down from the sky and every one present must 
take good heed to dodge it when it swings else it may box his ears 
and pitch him headlong overboard one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long 
keen weapon called a boarding sword and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a 
considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into this hole the end 
of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold 
upon the blubber in order to prepare for what follows whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning 
all hands to stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and 
with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain so that while 
the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanket piece 
swings clear and is all ready for lowering the heavers forward now resume their song 
and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale 
the other is slowly slackened away and down goes the first strip through the main 
hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber room into this twilight apartment 
sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket piece as if it were a 
great live mass of plaited serpents and thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting 
and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing the blubber room gentlemen 
coiling the mates scarfing the ship straining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of 
assuaging the general friction chapter 68 the blanket i have given no small attention to 
that not unvexed subject the skin of the whale i have had controversies about it 
with experienced whalemen afloat and learned naturalists ashore my original opinion remains unchanged but it 
is only an opinion the question is what and where is the skin of the 
whale already you know what his blubber is that blubber is something of the consistence 
of firm close grained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and ranges from eight 
or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness now however preposterous it may at 
first seem to talk of any skin as being of that sort of consistence and 
thickness yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption because 
you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the body but that same blubber 
and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that be 
but the skin true from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape 
off with your hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of 
isinglass only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin that is previous to 
being dried when it not only contracts and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle 
i have several such dried bits which i use for marks in my whale books 
it is transparent as i said before and being laid upon the printed page i 
have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence at any rate it 
is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles as you may say but 
what i am driving at here is this that same infinitely thin isinglass substance which 
i admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be 
regarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to 
speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous 
whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new born child but 
no more of this assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then 
when this skin as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield 
the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in 
quantity or rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only three fourths and 
not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be had of the 
enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a 
lake of liquid as that reckoning ten barrels to the ton you have ten tons 
for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the skin in 
life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many 
marvels he presents almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re crossed with 
numberless straight marks in thick array something like those in the finest italian line engravings 
but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned 
but seem to be seen through it as if they were engraved upon the body 
itself nor is this all in some instances to the quick observant eye those linear 
marks as in a veritable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineations these 
are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids 
hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion by my 
retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular i was much struck 
with a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on 
the banks of the upper mississippi like those mystic rocks too the mystic marked whale 
remains undecipherable this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another thing besides all 
the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm whale presents he not seldom displays 
the back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear 
appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random aspect i should 
say that those new england rocks on the sea coast which agassiz imagines to bear 
the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating should say that those rocks must 
not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular it also seems to me 
that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales 
for i have most remarked them in the large full grown bulls of the species 
a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the 
whale it has already been said that it is stript from him in long pieces 
called blanket pieces like most sea terms this one is very happy and significant for 
the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or 
counterpane or still better an indian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity 
it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is 
enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides what 
would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the north 
if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those 
hyperborean waters but these be it observed are your cold blooded lungless fish whose very 
bellies are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg as a 
traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale has 
lungs and warm blood freeze his blood and he dies how wonderful is it after 
this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man 
how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed to his lips for life 
in those arctic waters where when seamen fall overboard they are sometimes found months afterwards 
perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued 
in amber but more surprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment 
that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro 
in summer it does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of 
a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare virtue 
of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyself after the whale do thou too 
remain warm among ice do thou too live in this world without being of it 
be cool at the equator keep thy blood fluid at the pole like the great 
dome of st and like the great whale retain o man in all seasons a 
temperature of thine own but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things 
of erections how few are domed like st of creatures how few vast as the 
whale chapter 69 the funeral in the chains let the carcase go astern the vast 
tackles have now done their duty the peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes 
like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue it has not perceptibly lost anything in 
bulk it is still colossal slowly it floats more and more away the water round 
it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks and the air above vexed with rapacious 
flights of screaming fowls whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale 
the vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship and every rod 
that it so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls 
augment the murderous din for hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous 
sight is seen beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair face of 
the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breezes that great mass of death floats on 
and on till lost in infinite perspectives a most doleful and most mocking funeral the 
sea vultures all in pious mourning the air sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled 
in life but few of them would have helped the whale i ween if peradventure 
he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do 
pounce oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not the mightiest whale is free nor 
is this the end desecrated as the body is a vengeful ghost survives and hovers 
over it to scare espied by some timid man of war or blundering discovery vessel 
from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls nevertheless still shows the white mass 
floating in the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the unharming 
corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the shoals rocks and breakers hereabouts beware 
and for years afterwards perhaps ships shun the place leaping over it as silly sheep 
leap over a vacuum because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held 
your law of precedents your utility of traditions the story of your obstinate survival of 
old beliefs never bottomed on the earth and now not even hovering in the air 
orthodoxy thus while in life the great body may have been a real terror to 
his foes in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world are 
you a believer in ghosts my friend there are other ghosts than the cock lane 
one and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believe in them chapter 70 the 
sphynx it should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of 
the leviathan he was beheaded now the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific 
anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason 
consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck on the 
contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is 
the thickest part of him remember also that the surgeon must operate from above some 
eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject and that subject almost hidden 
in a discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear in mind too that 
under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh and 
in that subterraneous manner without so much as getting one single peep into the ever 
contracting gash thus made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted parts and 
exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull 
do you not marvel then at boast that he demanded but ten minutes to behead 
a sperm whale when first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by 
a cable till the body is stripped that done if it belong to a small 
whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of but with a full 
grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm head embraces nearly one third of his 
entire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden as that even by the immense 
tackles of a whaler this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a 
dutch barn in scales the whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head was 
hoisted against the half way out of the sea so that it might yet in 
great part be buoyed up by its native element and there with the strained craft 
steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower 
mast head and every yard arm on that side projecting like a crane over the 
waves there that blood dripping head hung to the waist like the giant from the 
girdle of judith when this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen 
went below to their dinner silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck 
an intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus was more and more unfolding its 
noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea a short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness 
came ahab alone from his cabin taking a few turns on the quarter deck he 
paused to gaze over the side then slowly getting into the main chains he took 
long remaining there after the striking it into the lower part of the half suspended 
mass placed its other end crutch wise under one arm and so stood leaning over 
with eyes attentively fixed on this head it was a black and hooded head and 
hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm it seemed the in the 
desert thou vast and venerable head muttered ahab though ungarnished with a beard yet here 
and there lookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head and tell us the secret thing 
that is in thee of all divers thou hast dived the deepest that head upon 
which the upper sun now gleams has moved amid this foundations where unrecorded names and 
navies rust and untold hopes and anchors rot where in her murderous hold this frigate 
earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned there in that awful water 
land there was thy most familiar home thou hast been where bell or diver never 
went hast slept by many a side where sleepless mothers would give their lives to 
lay them down thou the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship heart to 
heart they sank beneath the exulting wave true to each other when heaven seemed false 
to them thou the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck for 
hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw and his murderers still 
sailed on swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband 
to outstretched longing arms o head thou hast seen enough to split the planets and 
make an infidel of abraham and not one syllable is thine ho cried a triumphant 
voice from the main mast head well now cheering cried ahab suddenly erecting himself while 
whole thunder clouds swept aside from his brow lively cry upon this deadly calm might 
almost convert a better man away points on the starboard bow sir and bringing down 
her breeze to us and better man would now st paul would come along that 
way and to my breezelessness bring his breeze o nature and o soul of man 
how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies not the smallest atom stirs or 
lives on matter but has its cunning duplicate in mind chapter 71 the story hand 
in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than the ship 
and soon the pequod began to rock by and by through the glass the boats 
and manned mast heads proved her a whale ship but as she was so far 
to windward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground the pequod 
could not hope to reach her so the signal was set to see what response 
would be made here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the 
ships of the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signals being 
collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached every captain is 
provided with it thereby the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the 
ocean even at considerable distances and with no small facility the signal was at last 
responded to by the setting her own which proved the ship to be the jeroboam 
of nantucket squaring her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the lee and lowered 
a boat it soon drew nigh but as the side ladder was being rigged by 
order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his 
stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that the jeroboam 
had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew her captain was fearful of infecting 
the company for though himself and crew remained untainted and though his ship was half 
a rifle shot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between yet 
conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to come into 
direct contact with the pequod but this did by no means prevent all communications preserving 
an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship the boat by the 
occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the pequod as she heavily 
forged through the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with her main 
topsail aback though indeed at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave 
the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to 
her proper bearings again subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then 
a conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not without still another 
interruption of a very different sort pulling an oar in the boat was a man 
of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up 
all totalities he was a small short youngish man sprinkled all over his face with 
freckles and wearing redundant yellow hair a long skirted cabalistically cut coat of a faded 
walnut tinge enveloped him the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists 
a deep settled fanatic delirium was in his eyes so soon as this figure had 
been first descried stubb had he he long togged scaramouch the town company told us 
of stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam and a certain 
man among her crew some time previous when the pequod spoke the town ho according 
to this account and what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in question 
had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam his story was this 
he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shakers where he had 
been a great prophet in their cracked secret meetings having several times descended from heaven 
by the way of a trap door announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial 
which he carried in his vest pocket but which instead of containing gunpowder was supposed 
to be charged with laudanum a strange apostolic whim having seized him he had left 
neskyeuna for nantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady common 
sense exterior and offered himself as a green hand candidate for the whaling voyage they 
engaged him but straightway upon the getting out of sight of land his insanity broke 
out in a freshet he announced himself as the archangel gabriel and commanded the captain 
to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer 
of the isles of the sea and vicar general of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness 
with which he declared these things dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and 
all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united to invest this gabriel in the minds 
of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they were 
afraid of him as such a man however was not of much practical use in 
the ship especially as he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous captain 
would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that intention was to land 
him in the first convenient port the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and the 
ship and all hands to unconditional perdition in case this intention was carried out so 
strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew that at last in a 
body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel was sent from the 
ship not a man of them would remain he was therefore forced to relinquish his 
plan nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what 
he would so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of 
the ship the consequence of all this was that the archangel cared little or nothing 
for the captain and mates and since the epidemic had broken out he carried a 
higher hand than ever declaring that the plague as he called it was at his 
sole command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure the sailors 
mostly poor devils cringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience to his 
instructions sometimes rendering him personal homage as to a god such things may seem incredible 
but however wondrous they are true nor is the history of fanatics half so striking 
in respect to the measureless self deception of the fanatic himself as his measureless power 
of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but it is time to return to the 
pequod fear not thy epidemic man said ahab from the bulwarks to captain mayhew who 
stood in the stern on board but now gabriel started to his feet think of 
the fevers yellow and bilious beware of the horrible plague gabriel cried captain mayhew must 
but that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings drowned 
all speech thou seen the white whale demanded ahab when the boat drifted back think 
of thy whale boat stoven and sunk beware of the horrible tail tell thee again 
gabriel but again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends nothing was said 
for some moments while a succession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of 
those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving it meantime the hoisted sperm 
head jogged about very violently and gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness 
than his archangel nature seemed to warrant when this interlude was over captain mayhew began 
a dark story concerning moby dick not however without frequent interruptions from gabriel whenever his 
name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him it seemed that 
the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking a whale ship her people 
were reliably apprised of the existence of moby dick and the havoc he had made 
greedily sucking in this intelligence gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale 
in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the white whale 
to be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated the shakers receiving the 
bible but when some year or two afterwards moby dick was fairly sighted from the 
mast heads macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain 
himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all the denunciations and 
forewarnings macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed 
off and after much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onsets he at last succeeded 
in getting one iron fast meantime gabriel ascending to the main royal mast head was 
tossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the 
sacrilegious assailants of his divinity now while macey the mate was standing up in his 
bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations 
upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo 
a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion temporarily taking 
the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen next instant the luckless mate so 
full of furious life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc 
in his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards not 
a chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any head but the 
mate for ever sank it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents 
in the sperm whale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any sometimes 
nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated oftener the bow is knocked 
off or the thigh board in which the headsman stands is torn from its place 
and accompanies the body but strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances 
than one when the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence is 
discernible the man being stark dead the whole calamity with the falling form of macey 
was plainly descried from the ship raising a piercing vial the vial gabriel called off 
the terror stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale this terrible event clothed 
the archangel with added influence because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore 
announced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any one might have done 
and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed 
he became a nameless terror to the ship mayhew having concluded his narration ahab put 
such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended 
to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which ahab straightway then gabriel 
once more started to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with 
downward pointed think of the and down there of the end ahab stolidly turned aside 
then said to mayhew i have just bethought me of my letter bag there is 
a letter for one of thy officers if i mistake not starbuck look over the 
bag every whale ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships whose 
delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance 
of encountering them in the four oceans thus most letters never reach their mark and 
many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more 
soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it was sorely tumbled damp and 
covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence of being kept in a dark 
locker of the cabin of such a letter death himself might well have been the 
post boy not read it cried ahab it me man aye aye but a dim 
scrawl this as he was studying it out starbuck took a long cutting spade pole 
and with his knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in 
that way hand it to the boat without its coming any closer to the ship 
meantime ahab holding the letter muttered mr a pinny hand wife wager harry macey ship 
jeroboam macey and dead fellow poor fellow and from his wife sighed mayhew let me 
have it keep it thyself cried gabriel to ahab art soon going that way throttle 
thee yelled ahab mayhew stand by now to receive and taking the fatal missive from 
hands he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards 
the boat but as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing the boat 
drifted a little towards the stern so that as if by magic the letter suddenly 
ranged along with eager hand he clutched it in an instant seized the boat knife 
and impaling the letter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship it 
fell at feet then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their 
oars and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod as 
after this interlude the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale many 
strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair chapter 72 the monkey rope 
in the tumultuous business of cutting in and attending to a whale there is much 
running backwards and forwards among the crew now hands are wanted here and then again 
hands are wanted there there is no staying in any one place for at one 
and the same time everything has to be done everywhere it is much the same 
with him who endeavors the description of the scene we must now retrace our way 
a little it was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the back the blubber 
hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates 
but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed 
in that hole it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg whose duty it 
was as harpooneer to descend upon the back for the special purpose referred to but 
in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till 
the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded the whale be it observed lies almost 
entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon so down there some ten feet below 
the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the whale and 
half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a tread mill beneath him 
on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the highland shirt and which to my 
eyes at least he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance 
to observe him as will presently be seen being the bowsman that is the person 
who pulled the bow oar in his boat the second one from forward it was 
my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard scrabble scramble upon the 
dead back you have seen italian organ boys holding a dancing ape by a long 
cord just so from the steep side did i hold queequeg down there in the 
sea by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey rope attached to a 
strong strip of canvas belted round his waist it was a humorously perilous business for 
both of us for before we proceed further it must be said that the monkey 
rope was fast at both ends fast to broad canvas belt and fast to my 
narrow leather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time 
were wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage and 
honor demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag me down in his 
wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united us queequeg was my own inseparable twin 
brother nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen 
bond entailed so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that while 
earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now 
merged in a joint stock company of two that my free will had received a 
mortal wound and that mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and 
death therefore i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence for its 
even handed equity never could have so gross an injustice and yet still further i 
jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to 
jam further pondering i say i saw that this situation of mine was the precise 
situation of every mortal that breathes only in most cases he one way or other 
has this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals if your banker breaks you 
snap if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills you die true 
you may say that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous 
other evil chances of life but handle monkey rope heedfully as i would sometimes he 
jerked it so that i came very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget 
that do what i would i only had the management of one end of it 
the monkey rope is found in all whalers but it was only in the pequod 
that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this improvement upon the original 
usage was introduced by no less a man than stubb in order to afford the 
imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey rope 
holder i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale 
and the he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both but 
this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to unappalled by the massacre 
made upon them during the night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by 
the before pent blood which began to flow from the rabid creatures swarmed round it 
like bees in a beehive and right in among those sharks was queequeg who often 
pushed them aside with his floundering feet a thing altogether incredible were it not that 
attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom 
touch a man nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a 
ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them 
accordingly besides the monkey rope with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow 
from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious was 
provided with still another protection suspended over the side in one of the stages tashtego 
and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale spades wherewith they 
slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach this procedure of theirs to be sure 
was very disinterested and benevolent of them they meant best happiness i admit but in 
their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both he and the 
sharks were at times half hidden by the blood muddled water those indiscreet spades of 
theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail but poor queequeg i suppose 
straining and gasping there with that great iron queequeg i suppose only prayed to his 
yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods well well my 
dear comrade and twin brother thought i as i drew in and then slacked off 
the rope to every swell of the matters it after all are you not the 
precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world that unsounded 
ocean you gasp in is life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and 
what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad 
but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now as with 
blue lips and blood shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains 
and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side the steward advances and with 
a benevolent consolatory glance hands some hot cognac no hands him ye gods hands him 
a cup of tepid ginger and water do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming 
near this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cup then standing as 
if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying ginger 
and will you have the goodness to tell me mr dough boy where lies the 
virtue of ginger ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use dough boy to 
kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal ginger the devil is ginger sea coal firewood 
matches the devil is ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor 
queequeg here is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business he suddenly added now 
approaching starbuck who had just come from forward you look at that kannakin sir smell 
of it if you please then watching the countenance he added steward mr starbuck had 
the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg there this instant off the 
whale is the steward an apothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the 
sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half drowned man 
trust not said starbuck is poor stuff enough aye steward cried stubb teach you to 
drug a harpooneer none of your medicine here you want to poison us do ye 
you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all and 
pocket the proceeds do ye was not me cried dough boy was aunt charity that 
brought the ginger on board and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits but 
only this ginger she called it jub you gingerly rascal take that and run along 
with ye to the lockers and get something better i hope i do no wrong 
mr starbuck it is the for the harpooneer on a whale replied starbuck hit him 
again i never hurt when i hit except when i hit a whale or something 
of that sort and this a weazel what were you about saying sir this go 
down with him and get what thou wantest thyself when stubb reappeared he came with 
a dark flask in one hand and a sort of tea caddy in the other 
the first contained strong spirits and was handed to queequeg the second was aunt gift 
and that was freely given to the waves chapter 73 stubb and flask kill a 
right whale and then have a talk over him it must be borne in mind 
that all this time we have a sperm prodigious head hanging to the side but 
we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance 
to attend to it for the present other matters press and the best we can 
do now for the head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold now during 
the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by 
its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales 
a species of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time 
lurking anywhere near and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures 
and though the pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all and though 
she had passed numbers of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now 
that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all 
the announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day if opportunity 
offered nor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and two boats 
and were detached in pursuit pulling further and further away they at last became almost 
invisible to the men at the mast head but suddenly in the distance they saw 
a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that 
one or both the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were 
in plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the 
towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at first it 
seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a maelstrom within 
three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from view as if diving under the 
keel cut was the cry from the ship to the boats which for one instant 
seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the side but 
having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly 
they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their 
might so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the struggle 
was intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction 
and still plied their oars in another the contending strain threatened to take them under 
but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain and they stuck 
to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running 
like lightning along the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose 
to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its drippings that 
the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond 
also rose to sight and once more the boats were free to fly but the 
fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of 
the ship towing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete circuit 
meantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till close flanking him on both 
sides stubb answered flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod 
the battle went while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm 
body rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every new gash 
as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten 
rock at last his spout grew thick and with a frightful roll and vomit he 
turned upon his back a corpse while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast 
cords to his flukes and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing 
some conversation ensued between them wonder what the old man wants with this lump of 
foul lard said stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do 
with so ignoble a leviathan with it said flask coiling some spare line in the 
bow you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm head hoisted 
on her starboard side and at the same time a right on the larboard did 
you never hear stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize not know but i 
heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so and he seems to know all 
about charms but i sometimes think charm the ship to no good at last i 
half like that chap stubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is 
a sort of carved into a head stubb him i never look at him at 
all but if ever i get a chance of a dark night and he standing 
hard by the bulwarks and no one by look down there into the sea with 
a peculiar motion of both will i flask i take that fedallah to be the 
devil in disguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been 
stowed away on board ship the devil i say the reason why you see his 
tail is because he tucks it up out of sight he carries it coiled away 
in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of it always wanting 
oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots sleeps in his boots he he 
got any hammock but seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging doubt 
and because of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye see in the 
eye of the rigging the old man have so much to do with him for 
up a swap or a bargain i suppose what do ye see the old man 
is hard bent after that white whale and the devil there is trying to come 
round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or 
something of that sort and then surrender moby dick stubb you are skylarking how can 
fedallah do that know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked 
one i tell ye why they say as how he went a sauntering into the 
old flag ship once switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquiring if 
the old governor was at home well he was at home and asked the devil 
what he wanted the devil switching his hoofs up and says want john for says 
the old governor business is that of yours says the devil getting mad want to 
use him him says the by the lord flask if the devil give john the 
asiatic cholera before he got through with him eat this whale in one mouthful but 
look you all ready there well then pull ahead and get the whale alongside think 
i remember some such story as you were telling said flask when at last the 
two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship i remember where spaniards 
adventures of those three bloody minded soldadoes did ye read it there flask i guess 
ye did never saw such a book heard of it though but now tell me 
stubb do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now was the 
same you say is now on board the pequod i the same man that helped 
kill this whale the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil was 
dead did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if 
the devil has a latch key to get into the cabin you suppose he can 
crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask old do you suppose fedallah is 
stubb you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship the figure one now take 
all the hoops in the hold and string along in a row with that mast 
for oughts do you see well that begin to be age nor all the coopers 
in creation show hoops enough to make oughts enough see here stubb i thought you 
a little boasted just now that you meant to give fedallah a sea toss if 
you got a good chance now if so old as all those hoops of yours 
come to and if he is going to live for ever what good will it 
do to pitch him me that him a good ducking anyhow crawl back him again 
and keep ducking him he should take it into his head to duck you and 
drown then should like to see him try it give him such a pair of 
black eyes that he dare to show his face in the cabin again for a 
long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and hereabouts on 
the upper decks where he sneaks so much damn the devil flask so you suppose 
afraid of the devil afraid of him except the old governor who catch him and 
put him in double darbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping people 
aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped roast 
for him a governor you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab i suppose it 
know it before long flask but i am going now to keep a sharp look 
out on him and if i see anything very suspicious going on just take him 
by the nape of his neck and here beelzebub you do it and if he 
makes any fuss by the lord make a grab into his pocket for his tail 
take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his 
tail will come short off at the you see and then i rather guess when 
he finds himself docked in that queer fashion sneak off without the poor satisfaction of 
feeling his tail between his legs what will you do with the tail stubb with 
it sell it for an ox whip when we get home else do you mean 
what you say and have been saying all along stubb or not mean here we 
are at the ship the boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the 
larboard side where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him i 
tell you so said flask soon see this right head hoisted up opposite that in 
good time saying proved true as before the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm 
head now by the counterpoise of both heads she regained her even keel though sorely 
strained you may well believe so when on one side you hoist in head you 
go over that way but now on the other side hoist in and you come 
back again but in very poor plight thus some minds for ever keep trimming boat 
oh ye foolish throw all these thunder heads overboard and then you will float light 
and right in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the 
ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm 
whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the 
former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the 
well known black bone attached to what is called the crown piece but nothing like 
this in the present case had been done the carcases of both whales had dropped 
astern and the head laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair 
of overburdening panniers meantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right head and ever and anon 
glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand and ahab 
chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his shadow while if the shadow was 
there at all it seemed only to blend with and lengthen as the crew toiled 
on laplandish speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing things chapter 74 the 
sperm view here now are two great whales laying their heads together let us join 
them and lay together our own of the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm 
whale and the right whale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only 
whales regularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two extremes of all 
the known varieties of the whale as the external difference between them is mainly observable 
in their heads and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the 
side and as we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping 
across the deck i should like to know will you obtain a better chance to 
study practical cetology than here in the first place you are struck by the general 
contrast between these heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a 
certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm which the right sadly lacks there is more character 
in the sperm head as you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to 
him in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is heightened 
by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit giving token of 
advanced age and large experience in short he is what the fishermen technically call a 
headed whale let us now note what is least dissimilar in these the two most 
important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of the head 
and low down near the angle of either jaw if you narrowly search you will 
at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young eye 
so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head now from 
this peculiar sideway position of the eyes it is plain that he can never see 
an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern in 
a word the position of the eyes corresponds to that of a ears and you 
may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects 
through your ears you would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of 
vision in advance of the straight side line of sight and about thirty more behind 
it if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad 
day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were 
stealing upon you from behind in a word you would have two backs so to 
speak but at the same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it 
that makes the front of a indeed but his eyes moreover while in most other 
animals that i can now think of the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to 
blend their visual power so as to produce one picture and not two to the 
brain the peculiar position of the eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic 
feet of solid head which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes 
in valleys this of course must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts 
the whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture 
on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him man 
may in effect be said to look out on the world from a sentry box 
with two joined sashes for his window but with the whale these two sashes are 
separately inserted making two distinct windows but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the 
eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to 
be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes a curious and most puzzling question 
might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be 
content with a hint so long as a eyes are open in the light the 
act of seeing is involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects 
are before him nevertheless any experience will teach him that though he can take in 
an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively 
and completely to examine any two large or however one and the same instant of 
time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other but if 
you now come to separate these two objects and surround each by a circle of 
profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner as 
to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from 
your contemporary consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes in 
themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle 
than that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects 
one on one side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if 
he can then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man 
were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in euclid nor 
strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this comparison it may be but an idle 
whim but it has always seemed to me that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed 
by some whales when beset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to 
queer frights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectly proceeds from 
the helpless perplexity of volition in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision 
must involve them but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the 
eye if you are an entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these 
two heads for hours and never discover that organ the ear has no external leaf 
whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute 
is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with respect to their ears 
this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right while 
the ear of the former has an external opening that of the latter is entirely 
and evenly covered over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without 
is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the 
world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is 
smaller than a but if his eyes were broad as the lens of great telescope 
and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals would that make him any longer 
of sight or sharper of hearing not at all then do you try to your 
mind subtilize it let us now with whatever levers and steam engines we have at 
hand cant over the sperm head that it may lie bottom up then ascending by 
a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not 
that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend 
into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but let us hold on here 
by this tooth and look about us where we are what a really beautiful and 
chaste looking mouth from floor to ceiling lined or rather papered with a glistening white 
membrane glossy as bridal satins but come out now and look at this portentous lower 
jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff box with the 
hinge at one end instead of one side if you pry it up so as 
to get it overhead and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis 
and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom 
these spikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold when 
fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there suspended with his 
prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging straight down at right angles with his body 
for all the world like a jib boom this whale is not dead he is 
only dispirited out of sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his 
jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to 
all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lock jaws upon him in most cases 
this lower easily unhinged by a practised disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose 
of extracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with 
which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles including canes umbrella stocks and handles 
to riding whips with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as 
if it were an anchor and when the proper time few days after the other 
daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentists are set to drawing teeth with a keen 
cutting spade queequeg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and 
a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxen drag 
stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands there are generally forty two teeth 
in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor filled after our artificial 
fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs and piled away like joists for building 
houses chapter 75 the right view crossing the deck let us now have a good 
long look at the right head as in general shape the noble sperm head may 
be compared to a roman war chariot especially in front where it is so broadly 
rounded so at a broad view the right head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to 
a gigantic galliot toed shoe two hundred years ago an old dutch voyager likened its 
shape to that of a last and in this same last or shoe that old 
woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she 
and all her progeny but as you come nearer to this great head it begins 
to assume different aspects according to your point of view if you stand on its 
summit and look at these two f shaped spoutholes you would take the whole head 
for an enormous bass viol and these spiracles the apertures in its sounding board then 
again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comb like incrustation on the 
top of the green barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the and the southern fishers 
the of the right whale fixing your eyes solely on this you would take the 
head for the trunk of some huge oak with a nest in its crotch at 
any rate when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet such 
an idea will be almost sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has 
been fixed by the technical term also bestowed upon it in which case you will 
take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of 
the sea whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner 
but if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to 
grace a diadem look at that hanging lower lip what a huge sulk and pout 
is there a sulk and pout by measurement about twenty feet long and five feet 
deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and 
more a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be hare lipped the fissure 
is about a foot across probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down 
the peruvian coast when earthquakes caused the beach to gape over this lip as over 
a slippery threshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at 
mackinaw i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good lord 
is this the road that jonah went the roof is about twelve feet high and 
runs to a pretty sharp angle as if there were a regular ridge pole there 
while these ribbed arched hairy sides present us with those wondrous half vertical scimetar shaped 
slats of whalebone say three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part 
of the head or crown bone form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily 
mentioned the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres through which the right 
whale strains the water and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed 
he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time in the central blinds of 
bone as they stand in their natural order there are certain curious marks curves hollows 
and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the age as the age of an oak by 
its circular rings though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it 
has the savor of analogical probability at any rate if we yield to it we 
must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will 
seem reasonable in old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning 
these blinds one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous inside of the mouth another 
a third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language are about two hundred 
and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper chop which arch over his 
tongue on each side of his mouth this reminds us that the right whale really 
has a sort of whisker or rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white 
hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these 
tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance as every one knows 
these same bristles or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks and other 
stiffening contrivances but in this particular the demand has long been on the decline it 
was in queen time that the bone was in its glory the farthingale being then 
all the fashion and as those ancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws 
of the whale as you may say even so in a shower with the like 
thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a 
tent spread over the same bone but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for 
a moment and standing in the right mouth look around you afresh seeing all these 
colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of 
the great haarlem organ and gazing upon its thousand pipes for a carpet to the 
organ we have a rug of the softest tongue which is glued as it were 
to the floor of the mouth it is very fat and tender and apt to 
tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck this particular tongue now before us at 
a passing glance i should say it was a six barreler that is it will 
yield you about that amount of oil ere this you must have plainly seen the 
truth of what i started the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely 
different heads to sum up then in the right there is no great well of 
sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like 
the sperm nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blinds of bone 
no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a tongue again the right whale has 
two external spout holes the sperm whale only one look your last now on these 
venerable hooded heads while they yet lie together for one will soon sink unrecorded in 
the sea the other will not be very long in following can you catch the 
expression of the sperm there it is the same he died with only some of 
the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away i think his broad brow 
to be full of a prairie like placidity born of a speculative indifference as to 
death but mark the other expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by accident against 
the side so as firmly to embrace the jaw does not this whole head seem 
to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death this right whale i take 
to have been a stoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up 
spinoza in his latter years chapter 76 the battering ram ere quitting for the nonce 
the sperm head i would have you as a sensible physiologist remark its front aspect 
in all its compacted collectedness i would have you investigate it now with the sole 
view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever battering ram power may 
be lodged there here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle this 
matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most 
appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded 
history you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale the front 
of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water you observe that 
the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards so as to furnish more of 
a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom like lower jaw you observe 
that the mouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed as 
though your own mouth were entirely under your chin moreover you observe that the whale 
has no external nose and that what nose he spout on the top of his 
head you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head 
nearly one third of his entire length from the front wherefore you must now have 
perceived that the front of the sperm head is a dead blind wall without a 
single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are now to consider 
that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of the head 
is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty feet 
from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development so that this whole 
enormous boneless mass is as one wad finally though as will soon be revealed its 
contents partly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of 
the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy in some 
previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the 
whale as the rind wraps an orange just so with the head but with this 
difference about the head this envelope though not so thick is of a boneless toughness 
inestimable by any man who has not handled it the severest pointed harpoon the sharpest 
lance darted by the strongest human arm impotently rebounds from it it is as though 
the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with hoofs i do not think that 
any sensation lurks in it bethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded 
indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do the 
sailors do they do not suspend between them at the point of coming contact any 
merely hard substance like iron or wood no they hold there a large round wad 
of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox hide that bravely 
and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron 
crow bars by itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at but supplementary 
to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that as ordinary fish possess what is 
called a swimming bladder in them capable at will of distension or contraction and as 
the sperm whale as far as i know has no such provision in him considering 
too the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the 
surface and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water considering the unobstructed 
elasticity of its envelope considering the unique interior of his head it has hypothetically occurred 
to me i say that those mystical lung celled honeycombs there may possibly have some 
hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air so as to be susceptible to 
atmospheric distension and contraction if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to 
which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes now mark unerringly impelling this 
dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all 
a mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood the cord 
and all obedient to one volition as the smallest insect so that when i shall 
hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this 
expansive monster when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats i 
trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this 
that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed 
the atlantic with the pacific you would not elevate one hair of your eye brow 
for unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth 
but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter how small the 
chances for the provincials then what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread veil at 
lais chapter 77 the great heidelburgh tun now comes the baling of the case but 
to comprehend it aright you must know something of the curious internal structure of the 
thing operated upon regarding the sperm head as a solid oblong you may on an 
inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower is the bony structure 
forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones 
its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the 
middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two almost 
equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous 
substance quoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics i 
know not that it has been defined before a quoin is a solid which differs 
from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one 
side instead of the mutual tapering of both sides the lower subdivided part called the 
junk is one immense honeycomb of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten 
thousand infiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent the upper part 
known as the case may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm 
whale and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the vast 
plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun moreover 
as that of heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of 
the rhenish valleys so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious 
of all his oily vintages namely the highly prized spermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid 
and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of 
the creature though in life it remains perfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air 
after death it soon begins to concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as when the 
first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large case generally yields about 
five hundred gallons of sperm though from unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks 
and dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what 
you can i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was 
coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the 
silken pearl coloured membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface 
of the sperm case it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the 
sperm whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and has 
been elsewhere set head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature then 
setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale you have more 
than twenty six feet for the depth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted 
up and down against a side as in decapitating the whale the instrument is brought 
close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine he 
has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary 
and wastingly let out its invaluable contents it is this decapitated end of the head 
also which is at last elevated out of the water and retained in that position 
by the enormous cutting tackles whose hempen combinations on one side make quite a wilderness 
of ropes in that quarter thus much being said attend now i pray you to 
that marvellous this particular fatal operation whereby the sperm great heidelburgh tun is tapped chapter 
78 cistern and buckets nimble as a cat tashtego mounts aloft and without altering his 
erect posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard arm to the part where it 
exactly projects over the hoisted tun he has carried with him a light tackle called 
a whip consisting of only two parts travelling through a single sheaved block securing this 
block so that it hangs down from the yard arm he swings one end of 
the rope till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck then 
hand over hand down the other part the indian drops through the air till dexterously 
he lands on the summit of the head high elevated above the rest of the 
company to whom he vivaciously seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayers 
from the top of a tower a short handled sharp spade being sent up to 
him he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun in 
this business he proceeds very heedfully like a treasure hunter in some old house sounding 
the walls to find where the gold is masoned in by the time this cautious 
search is over a stout iron bound bucket precisely like a well bucket has been 
attached to one end of the whip while the other end being stretched across the 
deck is there held by two or three alert hands these last now hoist the 
bucket within grasp of the indian to whom another person has reached up a very 
long pole inserting this pole into the bucket tashtego downward guides the bucket into the 
tun till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seamen at the whip 
up comes the bucket again all bubbling like a dairy pail of new milk carefully 
lowered from its height the full freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and 
quickly emptied into a large tub then remounting aloft it again goes through the same 
round until the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego has to 
ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper and deeper into the tun until 
some twenty feet of the pole have gone down now the people of the pequod 
had been baling some time in this way several tubs had been filled with the 
fragrant sperm when all at once a queer accident happened whether it was that tashtego 
that wild indian was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment 
his one handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head or whether the 
place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil one himself 
would have it to fall out so without stating his particular reasons how it was 
exactly there is no telling now but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth 
bucket came suckingly god poor the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well dropped head 
foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went 
clean out of sight overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternation first came to 
his senses the bucket this way and putting one foot into it so as the 
better to secure his slippery hand hold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him 
high up to the top of the head almost before tashtego could have reached its 
interior bottom meantime there was a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the 
before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea as if 
that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was only the poor indian unconsciously 
revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk at this instant 
while daggoo on the summit of the head was clearing the had somehow got foul 
of the great cutting sharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horror of 
all one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with a 
vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook as 
if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now 
depended seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way an event still 
more likely from the violent motions of the head down come down yelled the seamen 
to daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles so that if 
the head should drop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul 
line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the buried harpooneer 
should grasp it and so be hoisted out name man cried stubb you ramming home 
a cartridge there how will that help him jamming that iron bound bucket on top 
of his head avast will ye clear of the tackle cried a voice like the 
bursting of a rocket almost in the same instant with a thunder boom the enormous 
mass dropped into the sea like table rock into the whirlpool the suddenly relieved hull 
rolled away from it to far down her glittering copper and all caught their breath 
as half over the heads and now over the through a thick mist of spray 
was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poor buried alive tashtego was sinking 
utterly down to the bottom of the sea but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared 
away when a naked figure with a boarding sword in his hand was for one 
swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks the next a loud splash announced that my 
brave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush was made to the side 
and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed moment and no sign of either 
the sinker or the diver could be seen some hands now jumped into a boat 
alongside and pushed a little off from the ship ha cried daggoo all at once 
from his now quiet swinging perch overhead and looking further off from the side we 
saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as 
an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave both is both daggoo again 
with a joyful shout and soon after queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one 
hand and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into the 
waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego was long in coming 
to and queequeg did not look very brisk now how had this noble rescue been 
accomplished why diving after the slowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made 
side lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then dropping 
his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards and so hauled out 
poor tash by the head he averred that upon first thrusting in for him a 
leg was presented but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be 
and might occasion great trouble had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave 
and toss had wrought a somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial 
he came forth in the good old foremost as for the great head itself that 
was doing as well as could be expected and thus through the courage and great 
skill in obstetrics of queequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego was successfully accomplished 
in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments which is a 
lesson by no means to be forgotten midwifery should be taught in the same course 
with fencing and boxing riding and rowing i know that this queer adventure of the 
gay will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may have 
either seen or heard of some falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not 
seldom happens and with much less reason too than the considering the exceeding slipperiness of 
the curb of the sperm well but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is 
this we thought the tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale was the lightest and 
most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of 
a far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not at all but 
i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case had been 
nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the 
double welded hammered substance as i have before said much heavier than the sea water 
and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost but the tendency to 
rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other 
parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank very slowly and 
deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run 
as you may say yes it was a running delivery so it was now had 
tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perishing smothered in the 
very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner 
chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale only one sweeter end can readily be delicious 
death of an ohio honey hunter who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow 
tree found such exceeding store of it that leaning too far over it sucked him 
in so that he died embalmed how many think ye have likewise fallen into honey 
head and sweetly perished there chapter 79 the prairie to scan the lines of his 
face or feel the bumps on the head of this leviathan this is a thing 
which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost 
as hopeful as for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar 
or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon 
still in that famous work of his lavater not only treats of the various faces 
of men but also attentively studies the faces of horses birds serpents and fish and 
dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein nor have gall and his 
disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings 
than man therefore though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application 
of these two semi sciences to the whale i will do my endeavor i try 
all things i achieve what i can physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous 
creature he has no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most 
conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined 
expression hence it would seem that its entire absence as an external appendage must very 
largely affect the countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire cupola 
monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the 
scene so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open work belfry 
of the nose dash the nose from marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless 
leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportions are so stately that the 
same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at 
all nay it is an added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been 
impertinent as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly 
boat your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has 
a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtruding 
even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne in some particulars perhaps the 
most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the sperm whale is that of the 
full front of his head this aspect is sublime in thought a fine human brow 
is like the east when troubled with the morning in the repose of the pasture 
the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it pushing 
heavy cannon up mountain defiles the brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow 
is as that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their decrees it 
done this day by my hand but in most creatures nay in man himself very 
often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow 
line few are the foreheads which like or rise so high and descend so low 
that the eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes and all above them in 
the wrinkles you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink as the 
highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale 
this high and mighty god like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified 
that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the 
dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature for you 
see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is revealed no nose eyes ears 
or mouth no face he has none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of 
a forehead pleated with riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and 
men nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed its grandeur 
does not domineer upon you so in profile you plainly perceive that horizontal semi crescentic 
depression in the middle which in man is mark of genius but how genius in 
the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written a book spoken a speech no 
his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it it is 
moreover declared in his pyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm 
whale been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by their 
child magian thoughts they deified the crocodile of the nile because the crocodile is tongueless 
and the sperm whale has no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small 
as to be incapable of protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure 
back to their birth right the merry may day gods of old and livingly enthrone 
them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure 
exalted to high seat the great sperm whale shall lord it champollion deciphered the wrinkled 
granite hieroglyphics but there is no champollion to decipher the egypt of every and every 
face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable if then sir 
william jones who read in thirty languages could not read the simplest face in its 
profounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee 
of the sperm brow i but put that brow before you read it if you 
can chapter 80 the nut if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx to the 
phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square in the 
full grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length unhinge the 
lower jaw and the side view of this skull is as the side of a 
moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base but in we have elsewhere inclined 
plane is angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the 
junk and sperm at the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that 
part of the mass while under the long floor of this another cavity seldom exceeding 
ten inches in length and as many in the mere handful of this brain the 
brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden 
away behind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of quebec 
so like a choice casket is it secreted in him that i have known some 
whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable 
semblance of one formed by the cubic yards of his sperm magazine lying in strange 
folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it seems more in keeping with the idea 
of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of 
his intelligence it is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in the 
living intact state is an entire delusion as for his true brain you can then 
see no indications of it nor feel any the whale like all things that are 
mighty wears a false brow to the common world if you unload his skull of 
its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end which is 
the high end you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull beheld 
in the same situation and from the same point of view indeed place this reversed 
skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of skulls and you would 
involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit 
in phrenological phrase you would man had no self esteem and no veneration and by 
those negations considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power you 
can best form to yourself the truest though not the most exhilarating conception of what 
the most exalted potency is but if from the comparative dimensions of the proper brain 
you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea for you 
if you attentively regard almost any spine you will be struck with the resemblance of 
its vertebræ to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudimental resemblance to the 
skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebræ are absolutely undeveloped skulls but 
the curious external resemblance i take it the germans were not the first men to 
perceive a foreign friend once pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a 
foe he had slain and with the vertebræ of which he was inlaying in a 
sort of basso relievo the beaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the 
phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through 
the spinal canal for i believe that much of a character will be found betokened 
in his backbone i would rather feel your spine than your skull whoever you are 
a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul i 
rejoice in my spine as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which i 
fling half out to the world apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm 
whale his cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck vertebra and in that vertebra 
the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being eight in height 
and of a triangular figure with the base downwards as it passes through the remaining 
vertebræ the canal tapers in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity 
now of course this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous spinal the 
brain and directly communicates with the brain and what is still more for many feet 
after emerging from the cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal 
to that of the brain under all these circumstances would it be unreasonable to survey 
and map out the spine phrenologically for viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness 
of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his 
spinal cord but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists i 
would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the sperm hump 
this august hump if i mistake not rises over one of the larger vertebræ and 
is therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of it from its relative situation 
then i should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the 
sperm whale and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to 
know chapter 81 the pequod meets the virgin the predestinated day arrived and we duly 
met the ship jungfrau derick de deer master of bremen at one time the greatest 
whaling people in the world the dutch and germans are now among the least but 
here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet 
with their flag in the pacific for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to 
pay her respects while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and dropping 
a boat her captain was impelled towards us impatiently standing in the bows instead of 
the stern has he in his hand there cried starbuck pointing to something wavingly held 
by the german lamp feeder that said stubb no a coffee pot mr starbuck coming 
off to make us our coffee is the yarman you see that big tin can 
there alongside of him his boiling water oh all right is the yarman along with 
you cried flask a lamp feeder and an oil can out of oil and has 
come a begging however curious it may seem for an oil ship to be borrowing 
oil on the whale ground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb 
about carrying coals to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the 
present case captain derick de deer did indubitably conduct a lamp feeder as flask did 
declare as he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at all heeding what 
he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german soon evinced his 
complete ignorance of the white whale immediately turning the conversation to his lamp feeder and 
oil can with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night 
in profound last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a single flying fish 
yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what 
in the fishery is technically called a clean one that is an empty one well 
deserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin his necessities supplied derick departed but he 
had not gained his side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mast heads 
of both vessels and so eager for the chase was derick that without pausing to 
put his oil can and lamp feeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made 
after the leviathan lamp feeders now the game having risen to leeward he and the 
other three german boats that soon followed him had considerably the start of the keels 
there were eight whales an average pod aware of their danger they were going all 
abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their flanks as closely as so 
many spans of horses in harness they left a great wide wake as though continually 
unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea full in this rapid wake and many 
fathoms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow 
progress as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed afflicted with the 
jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed 
questionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social 
nevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him 
because the white bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one like 
the swell formed when two hostile currents meet his spout was short slow and laborious 
coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in torn shreds followed 
by strange subterranean commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried 
extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble got some paregoric said stubb has the 
stomach ache afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomach ache adverse winds 
are holding mad christmas in him boys the first foul wind i ever knew to 
blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be lost 
his tiller as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck load 
of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her way so did this old 
whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous 
rib ends expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his 
starboard fin whether he had lost that fin in battle or had been born without 
it it were hard to say wait a bit old chap and give ye a 
sling for that wounded arm cried cruel flask pointing to the whale line near him 
he sling thee with it cried starbuck way or the german will have him with 
one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish because not 
only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest 
to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost 
to defy pursuit for the time at this juncture the keels had shot by the 
three german boats last lowered but from the great start he had had boat still 
led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign rivals the only thing they 
feared was that from being already so nigh to his mark he would be enabled 
to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him as for derick 
he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding 
gesture shook his lamp feeder at the other boats ungracious and ungrateful dog cried starbuck 
mocks and dares me with the very poor box i filled for him not five 
minutes ago in his old intense way greyhounds dog to it tell ye what it 
is stubb to his against my religion to get mad but like to eat that 
villainous ye are ye going to let that rascal beat ye do ye love brandy 
a hogshead of brandy then to the best man come why some of ye burst 
a blood vessel that been dropping an anchor budge an becalmed halloo grass growing in 
the by the lord the mast budding this do boys look at that yarman the 
short and long of it is men will ye spit fire or not see the 
suds he makes cried flask dancing up and a do pile on the like a 
log oh my lads do jacks and quahogs for supper you know my clams and 
do do spring a hundred lose him oh that ye pull for your duff my 
a sog such a sogger ye love sperm there goes three thousand dollars men bank 
whole bank the bank of england do do do that yarman about now at this 
moment derick was in the act of pitching his lamp feeder at the advancing boats 
and also his oil can perhaps with the double view of retarding his way and 
at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward 
toss unmannerly dutch dogger cried stubb now men like fifty thousand line of battle ship 
loads of red haired devils what say tashtego are you the man to snap your 
spine in two and twenty pieces for the honor of old gayhead what say say 
pull like god dam the indian fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the 
german the three boats now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed momentarily neared him 
in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey 
the three mates stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry 
of she slides now hurrah for the white ash breeze down with the yarman sail 
over him but so decided an original start had derick had that spite of all 
their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not a righteous 
judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman 
while this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white ash and while in consequence 
boat was nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty 
rage was a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took 
a mortal start forwards and slantingly ranged up on the quarter an instant more and 
all four boats were diagonically in the immediate wake while stretching from them on both 
sides was the foaming swell that he made it was a terrific most pitiable and 
maddening sight the whale was now going head out and sending his spout before him 
in a continual tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an 
agony of fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering 
flight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the sea 
or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin so have i seen a 
bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air vainly striving to escape 
the piratical hawks but the bird has a voice and with plaintive cries will make 
known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was 
chained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that choking respiration through 
his spiracle and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his 
amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to appal the stoutest man 
who so pitied seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the 
boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick chose to 
hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last 
chance would for ever escape but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the 
stroke than all three tashtego sprang to their feet and standing in a diagonal row 
simultaneously pointed their barbs and darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three 
nantucket irons entered the whale blinding vapors of foam and white fire the three boats 
in the first fury of the headlong rush bumped the aside with such force that 
both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three 
flying keels be afraid my butter boxes cried stubb casting a passing glance upon them 
as he shot by be picked up saw some sharks dogs you distressed travellers hurrah 
this is the way to sail now every keel a sunbeam hurrah we go like 
three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar this puts me in mind 
of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a the wheel spokes fly boys 
when you fasten to him that way and danger of being pitched out too when 
you strike a hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feels when going to 
davy a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale carries the everlasting mail 
but the run was a brief one giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded with 
a grating rush the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as 
to gouge deep grooves in them while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid 
sounding would soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they caught repeated 
smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at to the perpendicular strain from 
the lead lined chocks of the boats whence the three ropes went straight down into 
the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the three sterns 
tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time 
they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position was a 
little ticklish but though boats have been taken down and lost in this way yet 
it is this on as it is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs 
of his live flesh from the back this it is that often torments the leviathan 
into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to 
speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course 
is always the best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the 
stricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the enormous 
surface of a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square pressure of the 
water is immense we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up 
under even here above ground in the air how vast then the burden of a 
whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean it must 
at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres one whaleman has estimated it at the 
weight of twenty line of battle ships with all their guns and stores and men 
on board as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down 
into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any 
sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its 
depths what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost 
monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony not eight inches of perpendicular 
rope were visible at the bows seems it credible that by three such thin threads 
the great leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended 
and to what to three bits of board is this the creature of whom it 
was once so triumphantly thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with 
fish spears the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the 
dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw the arrow cannot make him flee 
darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the 
creature this he oh that unfulfilments should follow the prophets for with the strength of 
a thousand thighs in his tail leviathan had run his head under the mountains of 
the sea to hide him from the fish spears in that sloping afternoon sunlight the 
shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough 
and broad enough to shade half army who can tell how appalling to the wounded 
whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head by men he stirs 
cried starbuck as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to 
them as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that 
every oarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great part from 
the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards as a 
small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into 
the sea in haul in cried starbuck again rising the lines of which hardly an 
instant before not one breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils 
flung back all dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two 
lengths of the hunters his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land animals 
there are certain valves or flood gates in many of their veins whereby when wounded 
the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions not 
so with the whale one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non 
valvular structure of the blood vessels so that when pierced even by so small a 
point as a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial 
system and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great 
distance below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant 
streams yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant and 
numerous its interior fountains that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable 
period even as in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the 
well springs of far off and undiscernible hills even now when the boats pulled upon 
this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into 
him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually 
playing while the natural spout hole in his head was only at intervals however rapid 
sending its affrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no blood yet came 
because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his life as they 
significantly call it was untouched as the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole 
upper part of his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly 
revealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were beheld as 
strange misgrown masses gather in the knot holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate so 
from the points which the eyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable 
to see but pity there was none for all his old age and his one 
arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order 
to light the gay bridals and other merry makings of men and also to illuminate 
the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all still rolling in his 
blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of 
a bushel low down on the flank nice spot cried flask let me prick him 
there once cried starbuck no need of that but humane starbuck was too late at 
the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded 
by it into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift 
fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with 
showers of gore capsizing boat and marring the bows it was his death stroke for 
by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled 
away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with 
his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up 
the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was most 
piteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn 
off from some mighty fountain and with half stifled melancholy gurglings the spray column lowers 
and lowers to the the last long dying spout of the whale soon while the 
crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body showed symptoms of sinking with 
all its treasures unrifled immediately by orders lines were secured to it at different points 
so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a 
few inches beneath them by the cords by very heedful management when the ship drew 
nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the 
stiffest fluke chains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at 
once sink to the bottom it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him 
with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his 
flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but as the stumps of 
harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales with the flesh perfectly 
healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there 
must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account 
for the ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fact of a lance 
head of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron the flesh 
perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance and when it might have 
been darted by some west indian long before america was discovered what other marvels might 
have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling but a sudden 
stop was put to further discoveries by the being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the 
sea owing to the immensely increasing tendency to sink however starbuck who had the ordering 
of affairs hung on to it to the last hung on to it so resolutely 
indeed that when at length the ship would have been capsized if still persisting in 
locking arms with the body then when the command was given to break clear from 
it such was the immovable strain upon the timber heads to which the fluke chains 
and cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast them off meantime everything in 
the pequod was aslant to cross to the other side of the deck was like 
walking up the steep gabled roof of a house the ship groaned and gasped many 
of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places by 
the unnatural dislocation in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable 
fluke chains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale 
now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached while every moment 
whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on 
the point of going over on hold on ye cried stubb to the body be 
in such a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do 
something or go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikes 
and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen knife and cut 
the big chains aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the heavy hatchet he leaned out 
of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest fluke chains but 
a few strokes full of sparks were given when the exceeding strain effected the rest 
with a terrific snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank now 
this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing 
nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it usually the dead sperm whale floats 
with great buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface if the 
only whales that thus sank were old meagre and broken hearted creatures their pads of 
lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason 
assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so 
sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it is not so 
for young whales in the highest health and swelling with noble aspirations prematurely cut off 
in the warm flush and may of life with all their panting lard about them 
even these brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sink be it said however that the sperm 
whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species where one of 
that sort go down twenty right whales do this difference in the species is no 
doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right 
whale his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the 
sperm whale is wholly free but there are instances where after the lapse of many 
hours or several days the sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life but 
the reason of this is obvious gases are generated in him he swells to a 
prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a line of battle ship could hardly 
keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundings among the bays of new 
zealand when a right whale gives token of sinking they fasten buoys to him with 
plenty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to 
look for it when it shall have ascended again it was not long after the 
sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the mast heads announcing that 
the jungfrau was again lowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that 
of a fin back belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of its incredible 
power of swimming nevertheless the fin spout is so similar to the sperm that by 
unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host 
were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all sail made 
after her four young keels and thus they all disappeared far to leeward still in 
bold hopeful chase oh many are the fin backs and many are the dericks my 
friend chapter 82 the honor and glory of whaling there are some enterprises in which 
a careful disorderliness is the true method the more i dive into this matter of 
whaling and push my researches up to the very spring head of it so much 
the more am i impressed with its great honorableness and antiquity and especially when i 
find so many great demi gods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way 
or other have shed distinction upon it i am transported with the reflection that i 
myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity the gallant perseus a son 
of jupiter was the first whaleman and to the eternal honor of our calling be 
it said that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any 
sordid intent those were the knightly days of our profession when we only bore arms 
to succor the distressed and not to fill lamp feeders every one knows the fine 
story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda the daughter of a king was 
tied to a rock on the sea coast and as leviathan was in the very 
act of carrying her off perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster 
and delivered and married the maid it was an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by 
the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this leviathan was slain at the 
very first dart and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient 
joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temples there stood 
for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which the legends and all the 
inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew when the 
romans took joppa the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph what seems most 
singular and suggestively important in this story is this it was from joppa that jonah 
set sail akin to the adventure of perseus and by some supposed to be indirectly 
derived from that famous story of st george and the dragon which dragon i maintain 
to have been a whale for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely 
jumbled together and often stand for each other art as a lion of the waters 
and as a dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in 
truth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides it would much subtract 
from the glory of the exploit had st george but encountered a crawling reptile of 
the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep any man 
may kill a snake but only a perseus a st george a coffin have the 
heart in them to march boldly up to a whale let not the modern paintings 
of this scene mislead us for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of 
old is vaguely represented of a griffin like shape and though the battle is depicted 
on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance of those times 
when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists and considering that as 
in case st whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach 
and considering that the animal ridden by st george might have been only a large 
seal or sea horse bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible 
with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to hold this so 
called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in fact placed before the strict 
and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol 
of the philistines dagon by name who being planted before the ark of israel his 
head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only the 
stump or fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noble stamp 
even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good rights we harpooneers 
of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st george and therefore 
let not the knights of that honorable company none of whom i venture to say 
have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never 
eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we 
are much better entitled to st decoration than they whether to admit hercules among us 
or not concerning this i long remained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies 
that antique crockett and kit brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds was swallowed down and 
thrown up by a whale still whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him that 
might be mooted it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed 
from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any 
rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i claim him for 
one of our clan but by the best contradictory authorities this grecian story of hercules 
and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story 
of jonah and the whale and vice versâ certainly they are very similar if i 
claim the demi god then why not the prophet nor do heroes saints demigods and 
prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order our grand master is still to 
be named for like royal kings of old times we find the head waters of 
our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves that wondrous oriental story is 
now to be rehearsed from the shaster which gives us the dread vishnoo one of 
the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos gives us this divine vishnoo himself 
for our lord who by the first of his ten earthly incarnations has for ever 
set apart and sanctified the whale when brahma or the god of gods saith the 
shaster resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth 
to vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical books whose perusal 
would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation and which therefore 
must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects these vedas 
were lying at the bottom of the waters so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale 
and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths rescued the sacred volumes was not 
this vishnoo a whaleman then even as a man who rides a horse is called 
a horseman perseus st george hercules jonah and vishnoo a member roll for you what 
club but the can head off like that chapter 83 jonah historically regarded reference was 
made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter now 
some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale but then there 
were some sceptical greeks and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their 
times equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin 
and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less 
facts for all that one old sag harbor chief reason for questioning the hebrew story 
was this had one of those quaint old fashioned bibles embellished with curious unscientific plates 
one of which represented whale with two spouts in his peculiarity only true with respect 
to a species of the leviathan the right whale and the varieties of that order 
concerning which the fishermen have this saying penny roll would choke his swallow is so 
very small but to this bishop anticipative answer is ready it is not necessary hints 
the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed in the belly but as temporarily lodged 
in some part of his mouth and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop 
for truly the right mouth would accommodate a couple of whist tables and comfortably seat 
all the players possibly too jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but 
on second thoughts the right whale is toothless another reason which sag harbor he went 
by that name urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet 
was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the gastric juices but this 
objection likewise falls to the ground because a german exegetist supposes that jonah must have 
taken refuge in the floating body of a dead as the french soldiers in the 
russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents and crawled into them besides it has 
been divined by other continental commentators that when jonah was thrown overboard from the joppa 
ship he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by some vessel with a 
whale for a figure head and i would add possibly called whale as some craft 
are nowadays christened the the the nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have 
opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life inflated 
bag of the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom 
poor sag harbor therefore seems worsted all round but he had still another reason for 
his want of faith it was this if i remember right jonah was swallowed by 
the whale in the mediterranean sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere 
within three journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three 
journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast how is that but was 
there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance 
of nineveh yes he might have carried him round by the way of the cape 
of good hope but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of 
the mediterranean and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea such a supposition 
would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days not to speak of 
the tigris waters near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any whale to 
swim in besides this idea of weathering the cape of good hope at so early 
a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew 
diaz its reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liar but all these foolish 
arguments of old sag harbor only evinced his foolish pride of thing still more reprehensible 
in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up 
from the sun and the sea i say it only shows his foolish impious pride 
and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a portuguese catholic priest this 
very idea of going to nineveh via the cape of good hope was advanced as 
a signal magnification of the general miracle and so it was besides to this day 
the highly enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and some three 
centuries ago an english traveller in old voyages speaks of a turkish mosque built in 
honor of jonah in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil 
chapter 84 pitchpoling to make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are 
anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their 
boat they grease the bottom nor is it to be doubted that as such a 
procedure can do no harm it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage considering that 
oil and water are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object 
in view is to make the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing his 
boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared took more than 
customary pains in that occupation crawling under its bottom where it hung over the side 
and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair 
from the bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment 
nor did it remain unwarranted by the event towards noon whales were raised but so 
soon as the ship sailed down to them they turned and fled with swift precipitancy 
a disordered flight as of barges from actium nevertheless the boats pursued and was foremost 
by great exertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the stricken whale 
without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness such unintermitted strainings 
upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it became imperative to 
lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but to haul the boat 
up to his flank was impossible he swam so fast and furious what then remained 
of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and countless subtleties to 
which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine manœuvre with the 
lance called pitchpoling small sword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like 
it it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand fact and feature 
is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently 
rocking jerking boat under extreme headway steel and wood included the entire spear is some 
ten or twelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the 
harpoon and also of a lighter it is furnished with a small rope called a 
warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after 
darting but before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon 
may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done 
and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and 
inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect become serious 
drawbacks as a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before 
any pitchpoling comes into play look now at stubb a man who from his humorous 
deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling 
look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat wrapt 
in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet ahead handling the long lance lightly 
glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight stubb 
whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure 
its free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full 
before his middle he levels it at the whale when covering him with it he 
steadily depresses the butt end in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon 
stands fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen feet in the air he minds you somewhat 
of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid 
nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance and 
quivers in the life spot of the whale instead of sparkling water he now spouts 
red blood drove the spigot out of him cried stubb immortal fourth all fountains must 
run wine today would now it were old orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable 
old monongahela then tashtego lad have ye hold a canakin to the jet and drink 
round it yea verily hearts alive brew choice punch in the spread of his spout 
hole there and from that live punch bowl quaff the living stuff again and again 
to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to its master 
like a greyhound held in skilful leash the agonized whale goes into his flurry the 
tow line is slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and mutely watches 
the monster die chapter 85 the fountain that for six thousand no one knows how 
many millions of ages great whales should have been spouting all over the sea and 
sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so many sprinkling or mistifying 
pots and that for some centuries back thousands of hunters should have been close by 
the fountain of the whale watching these sprinklings and all this should be and yet 
that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter minutes past one p m 
of this sixteenth day of december a d 1851 it should still remain a problem 
whether these spoutings are after all really water or nothing but is surely a noteworthy 
thing let us then look at this matter along with some interesting items contingent every 
one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills the finny tribes in general 
breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they 
swim hence a herring or a cod might live a century and never once raise 
its head above the surface but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him 
regular lungs like a human the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air 
in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world 
but he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude 
the sperm mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface and what is 
still more his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth no he breathes through his 
spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head if i say that 
in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws 
from the air a certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood 
imparts to the blood its vivifying principle i do not think i shall err though 
i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words assume it and it follows that if 
all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath he might then 
seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time that is to 
say he would then live without breathing anomalous as it may seem this is precisely 
the case with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full hour and more 
when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much as in any 
way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has no gills how is this 
between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a 
remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicelli like vessels which vessels when he quits the surface 
are completely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more a thousand 
fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him just as 
the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use 
in its four supplementary stomachs the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that 
the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me 
when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out 
as the fishermen phrase it this is what i mean if unmolested upon rising to 
the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform 
with all his other unmolested risings say he stays eleven minutes and jets seventy times 
that is respires seventy breaths then whenever he rises again he will be sure to 
have his seventy breaths over again to a minute now if after he fetches a 
few breaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be always dodging up 
again to make good his regular allowance of air and not till those seventy breaths 
are told will he finally go down to stay out his full term below remark 
however that in different individuals these rates are different but in any one they are 
alike now why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it 
be to replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good how obvious is it 
too that this necessity for the rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of 
the chase for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught 
when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o 
hunter as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee in man breathing is 
incessantly going breath only serving for two or three pulsations so that whatever other business 
he has to attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will 
but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time it 
has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout hole if it could 
truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water then i opine we should 
be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him for 
the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical 
spout hole and being so clogged with two elements it could not be expected to 
have the power of smelling but owing to the mystery of the it be water 
or whether it be absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head 
sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale has no proper olfactories but what does 
he want of them no roses no violets no cologne water in the sea furthermore 
as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal and as that 
long the grand erie furnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for 
the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has 
no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he 
talks through his nose but then again what has the whale to say seldom have 
i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world unless forced 
to stammer out something by way of getting a living oh happy that the world 
is such an excellent listener now the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended 
as it is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along horizontally 
just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this 
curious canal is very much like a gas pipe laid down in a city on 
one side of a street but the question returns whether this gas pipe is also 
a water pipe in other words whether the spout of the sperm whale is the 
mere vapor of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water 
taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle it is certain that the 
mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal but it cannot be proved that this is 
for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle because the greatest necessity for so 
doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally takes in water but the 
sperm food is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if he 
would besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you 
will find that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his 
jets and the ordinary periods of respiration but why pester one with all this reasoning 
on the subject speak out you have seen him spout then declare what the spout 
is can you not tell water from air my dear sir in this world it 
is not so easy to settle these plain things i have ever found your plain 
things the knottiest of all and as for this whale spout you might almost stand 
in it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely the central body 
of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you 
certainly tell whether any water falls from it when always when you are close enough 
to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a 
prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him and if at such times you should 
think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know 
that they are not merely condensed from its vapor or how do you know that 
they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout hole fissure which is 
countersunk into the summit of the head for even when tranquilly swimming through the mid 
day sea in a calm with his elevated hump sun dried as a in the 
desert even then the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head 
as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled 
up with rain nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over 
curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him 
to be peering into it and putting his face in it you cannot go with 
your pitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when 
coming into slight contact with the outer vapory shreds of the jet which will often 
happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of the thing so touching it 
and i know one who coming into still closer contact with the spout whether with 
some scientific object in view or otherwise i cannot say the skin peeled off from 
his cheek and arm wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to 
evade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt 
it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you 
the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let 
this deadly spout alone still we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish 
my hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides other reasons 
to this conclusion i am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity 
of the sperm whale i account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is 
an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other 
whales sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am convinced that from 
the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante 
and so on there always goes up a certain semi visible steam while in the 
act of thinking deep thoughts while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the 
curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there a curious 
involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head the invariable moisture of my 
hair while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin 
shingled attic of an august noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition 
and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold him 
solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild head overhung by a canopy 
of vapor engendered by his incommunicable contemplations and that you will sometimes see by a 
rainbow as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts for see rainbows 
do not visit the clear air they only irradiate vapor and so through all the 
thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind divine intuitions now and then shoot 
enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray and for this i thank god for all 
have doubts many deny but doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions doubts 
of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this combination makes neither believer 
nor infidel but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye chapter 86 
the tail other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope 
and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights less celestial i celebrate a 
tail reckoning the largest sized sperm tail to begin at that point of the trunk 
where it tapers to about the girth of a man it comprises upon its upper 
surface alone an area of at least fifty square feet the compact round body of 
its root expands into two broad firm flat palms or flukes gradually shoaling away to 
less than an inch in thickness at the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlap 
then sideways recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy between in no 
living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders 
of these flukes at its utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tail will 
considerably exceed twenty feet across the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded 
sinews but cut into it and you find that three distinct strata compose it middle 
and lower the fibres in the upper and lower layers are long and horizontal those 
of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layers this triune 
structure as much as anything else imparts power to the tail to the student of 
old roman walls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course 
of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique and 
which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry but as if 
this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough the whole bulk of 
the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments 
which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes insensibly blend 
with them and largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluent 
measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point could annihilation occur to 
matter this were the thing to do it nor does amazing strength at all tend 
to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through a 
titanism of power on the contrary those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it 
real strength never impairs beauty or harmony but it often bestows it and in everything 
imposingly beautiful strength has much to do with the magic take away the tied tendons 
that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules and its charm 
would be gone as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of 
goethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed as a 
roman triumphal arch when angelo paints even god the father in human form mark what 
robustness is there and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son 
the soft curled hermaphroditical italian pictures in which his idea has been most successfully embodied 
these pictures so destitute as they are of all brawniness hint nothing of any power 
but the mere negative feminine one of submission and endurance which on all hands it 
is conceded form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings such is the subtle elasticity 
of the organ i treat of that whether wielded in sport or in earnest or 
in anger whatever be the mood it be in its flexions are invariably marked by 
exceeding grace therein no arm can transcend it five great motions are peculiar to it 
first when used as a fin for progression second when used as a mace in 
battle third in sweeping fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking flukes first being horizontal in 
its position the tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other 
sea creatures it never wriggles in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority 
to the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion scroll wise coiled forwards 
beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this which gives that singular 
darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming his side fins only serve to 
steer by second it is a little significant that while one sperm whale only fights 
another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his conflicts with man he 
chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail in striking at a boat he swiftly curves away 
his flukes from it and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil if it 
be made in the unobstructed air especially if it descend to its mark the stroke 
is then simply irresistible no ribs of man or boat can withstand it your only 
salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the opposing water then 
partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale boat and the elasticity of its 
materials a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in 
the side is generally the most serious result these submerged side blows are so often 
received in the fishery that they are accounted mere play some one strips off a 
frock and the hole is stopped third i cannot demonstrate it but it seems to 
me that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for 
in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of 
the trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly 
gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to 
side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a whisker woe 
to that sailor whiskers and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch had 
this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethink me of elephant that so frequented 
the flower market and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed their 
zones on more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not 
possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yet another elephant 
that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk and extracted the dart fourth 
stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas 
you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kitten like he 
plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth but still you see his 
power in his play the broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the 
air then smiting the surface the thunderous concussion resounds for miles you would almost think 
a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor 
from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that was the smoke 
from the touch hole fifth as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the 
flukes lie considerably below the level of his back they are then completely out of 
sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge into the deeps his 
entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the 
air and so remain vibrating a moment till they downwards shoot out of view excepting 
the sublime breach else to be peaking of the flukes is perhaps the grandest sight 
to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail 
seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven so in dreams have i seen majestic satan 
thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but in gazing 
at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in 
the dantean the devils will occur to you if in that of isaiah the archangels 
standing at the mast head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and 
sea i once saw a large herd of whales in the east all heading towards 
the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes as it seemed 
to me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was 
never beheld even in persia the home of the fire worshippers as ptolemy philopater testified 
of the african elephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout 
of all beings for according to king juba the military elephants of antiquity often hailed 
the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence the chance comparison in this 
chapter between the whale and the elephant so far as some aspects of the tail 
of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned should not tend to 
place those two opposite organs on an equality much less the creatures to which they 
respectively belong for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan so compared 
with tail his trunk is but the stalk of a lily the most direful blow 
from the trunk were as the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless 
crush and crash of the sperm ponderous flukes which in repeated instances have one after 
the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air very 
much as an indian juggler tosses his balls though all comparison in the way of 
general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particular 
the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does 
to the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some points of curious similitude among these 
is the spout it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water 
or dust in his trunk and then elevating it jet it forth in a stream 
the more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore my inability to 
express it at times there are gestures in it which though they would well grace 
the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are 
these mystic gestures that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to free 
mason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods intelligently conversed with the 
world nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body full 
of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant dissect him how i may then 
i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i 
know not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more how 
comprehend his face when face he has none thou shalt see my back parts my 
tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen but i cannot 
completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face i 
say again he has no face chapter 87 the grand armada the long and narrow 
peninsula of malacca extending south eastward from the territories of birmah forms the most southerly 
point of all asia in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands 
of sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a vast mole or 
rampart lengthwise connecting asia with australia and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the 
thickly studded oriental archipelagoes this rampart is pierced by several sally ports for the convenience 
of ships and whales conspicuous among which are the straits of sunda and malacca by 
the straits of sunda chiefly vessels bound to china from the west emerge into the 
china seas those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java and standing midway in 
that vast rampart of islands buttressed by that bold green promontory known to seamen as 
java head they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast 
walled empire and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels and gold 
and ivory with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched it seems 
a significant provision of nature that such treasures by the very formation of the land 
should at least bear the appearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the all grasping 
western world the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses 
which guard the entrances to the mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the danes 
these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top sails from the endless 
procession of ships before the wind which for centuries past by night and by day 
have passed between the islands of sumatra and java freighted with the costliest cargoes of 
the east but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no 
means renounce their claim to more solid tribute time out of mind the piratical proas 
of the malays lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra have sallied 
out upon the vessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute at the point of 
their spears though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of 
european cruisers the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed yet even 
at the present day we occasionally hear of english and american vessels which in those 
waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged with a fair fresh wind the pequod was 
now drawing nigh to these straits ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan 
sea and thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and there by 
the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands and gain the far coast of 
japan in time for the great whaling season there by these means the circumnavigating pequod 
would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous to 
descending upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foiled in his 
pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the sea he was most 
known to frequent and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to 
be haunting it but how now in this zoned quest does ahab touch no land 
does his crew drink air surely he will stop for water nay for a long 
time now the circus running sun has raced within his fiery ring and needs no 
sustenance but in himself so ahab mark this too in the whaler while other hulls 
are loaded down with alien stuff to be transferred to foreign wharves the world wandering 
whale ship carries no cargo but herself and crew their weapons and their wants she 
has a whole contents bottled in her ample hold she is ballasted with utilities not 
altogether with unusable pig lead and kentledge she carries water in her clear old prime 
nantucket water which when three years afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefers to drink 
before the brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in casks from the peruvian or indian 
streams hence it is that while other ships may have gone to china from new 
york and back again touching at a score of ports the whale ship in all 
that interval may not have sighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no 
man but floating seamen like themselves so that did you carry them the news that 
another flood had come they would only boys the ark now as many sperm whales 
had been captured off the western coast of java in the near vicinity of the 
straits of sunda indeed as most of the ground roundabout was generally recognised by the 
fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gained more and more 
upon java head the look outs were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake 
but though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow 
and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a 
single jet was descried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts 
the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the customary cheering cry was heard 
from aloft and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us but here be 
it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been 
hunted over all four oceans the sperm whales instead of almost invariably sailing in small 
detached companies as in former times are now frequently met with in extensive herds sometimes 
embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of 
them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection to this aggregation 
of the sperm whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even 
in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together 
without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes 
seems thousands on thousands broad on both bows at the distance of some two or 
three miles and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a 
continuous chain of whale jets were up playing and sparkling in the noon day air 
unlike the straight perpendicular twin jets of the right whale which dividing at top fall 
over in two branches like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forward 
slanting spout of the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually 
rising and falling away to leeward seen from the deck then as she would rise 
on a high hill of the sea this host of vapory spouts individually curling up 
into the air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the 
thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some 
horseman on a height as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains accelerate 
their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear and once more 
expand in comparative security upon the plain even so did this vast fleet of whales 
now seem hurrying forward through the straits gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle and 
swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre crowding all sail the pequod pressed 
after them the harpooneers handling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their 
yet suspended boats if the wind only held little doubt had they that chased through 
these straits of sunda the vast host would only deploy into the oriental seas to 
witness the capture of not a few of their number and who could tell whether 
in that congregated caravan moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped 
white elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with stun sail piled on 
stun sail we sailed along driving these leviathans before us when of a sudden the 
voice of tashtego was heard loudly directing attention to something in our wake corresponding to 
the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear it seemed formed of 
detached white vapors rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales only they 
did not so completely come and go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing levelling 
his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved in his pivot hole crying there and 
rig whips and buckets to wet the sails sir and after us as if too 
long lurking behind the headlands till the pequod should fairly have entered the straits these 
rascally asiatics were now in hot pursuit to make up for their over cautious delay 
but when the swift pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase 
how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her 
own chosen pursuit riding whips and rowels to her that they were as with glass 
under arm ahab to and fro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the 
monsters he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such 
fancy as the above seemed his and when he glanced upon the green walls of 
the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing and bethought him that through 
that gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that same 
gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end and not 
only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally 
cheering him on with their curses all these conceits had passed through his brain brow 
was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has 
been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm thing from its place but 
thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and when after steadily dropping 
and dropping the pirates astern the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo 
point on the sumatra side emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then the 
harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship 
than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the malays but still 
driving on in the wake of the whales at length they seemed abating their speed 
gradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word was passed to 
spring to the boats but no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct 
of the sperm whale become notified of the three keels that were after them as 
yet a mile in their rear they rallied again and forming in close ranks and 
battalions so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets moved on 
with redoubled velocity stripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the white ash 
and after several pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase when a general pausing 
commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the 
influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fishermen perceive it in 
the whale they say he is gallied the compact martial columns in which they had 
been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and 
like king elephants in the indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation 
in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles and aimlessly swimming hither and thither by 
their short thick spoutings they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic this was still more 
strangely evinced by those of their number who completely paralysed as it were helplessly floated 
like water logged dismantled ships on the sea had these leviathans been but a flock 
of simple sheep pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves they could not possibly 
have evinced such excessive dismay but this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding 
creatures though banding together in tens of thousands the lion maned buffaloes of the west 
have fled before a solitary horseman witness too all human beings how when herded together 
in the sheepfold of a pit they will at the slightest alarm of fire rush 
helter skelter for the outlets crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death 
best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us for there is 
no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the 
madness of men though many of the whales as has been said were in violent 
motion yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced 
nor retreated but collectively remained in one place as is customary in those cases the 
boats at once separated each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of 
the shoal in about three time harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray 
in our faces and then running away with us like light steered straight for the 
heart of the herd though such a movement on the part of the whale struck 
under such circumstances is in no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or 
less anticipated yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery 
for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you 
bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb as blind and 
deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself 
of the iron leech that had fastened to him as we thus tore a white 
gash in the sea on all sides menaced as we flew by the crazed creatures 
to and fro rushing about us our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by 
ice isles in a tempest and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits 
knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed but not a 
bit daunted queequeg steered us manfully now sheering off from this monster directly across our 
route in advance now edging away from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while 
all the time starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of 
our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time 
to make long ones nor were the oarsmen quite idle though their wonted duty was 
now altogether dispensed with they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business of 
the way commodore cried one to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily 
to the surface and for an instant threatened to swamp us down with your tail 
there cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed calmly cooling himself 
with his own fan like extremity all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented by 
the nantucket indians called druggs two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly 
clenched together so that they cross each grain at right angles a line of considerable 
length is then attached to the middle of this block and the other end of 
the line being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it 
is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used for then more whales are 
close round you than you can possibly chase at one time but sperm whales are 
not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can and 
if you cannot kill them all at once you must wing them so that they 
can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it is that at times like these 
the drugg comes into requisition our boat was furnished with three of them the first 
and second were successfully darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by 
the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg they were cramped like malefactors with the 
chain and ball but upon flinging the third in the act of tossing overboard the 
clumsy wooden block it caught under one of the seats of the boat and in 
an instant tore it out and carried it away dropping the oarsman in the bottom 
as the seat slid from under him on both sides the sea came in at 
the wounded planks but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in and so 
stopped the leaks for the time it had been next to impossible to dart these 
drugged harpoons were it not that as we advanced into the herd our way greatly 
diminished moreover that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion 
the direful disorders seemed waning so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out 
and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum 
we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as if from 
some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake here the storms in 
the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard but not felt in this central 
expanse the sea presented that smooth satin like surface called a sleek produced by the 
subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods yes we were 
now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion 
and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles 
and saw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and 
round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder 
that a titanic circus rider might easily have over arched the middle ones and so 
have gone round on their backs owing to the density of the crowd of reposing 
whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape 
was at present afforded us we must watch for a breach in the living wall 
that hemmed us in the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut 
us up keeping at the centre of the lake we were occasionally visited by small 
tame cows and calves the women and children of this routed host now inclusive of 
the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles and inclusive of the spaces between 
the various pods in any one of those circles the entire area at this juncture 
embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square miles 
at any indeed such a test at such a time might be might be discovered 
from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon 
i mention this circumstance because as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked 
up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the herd had 
hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping or possibly being so 
young unsophisticated and every way innocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller 
and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the a wondrous fearlessness and 
confidence or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at 
like household dogs they came snuffling round us right up to our gunwales and touching 
them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them queequeg patted their 
foreheads starbuck scratched their backs with his lance but fearful of the consequences for the 
time refrained from darting it but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another 
and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side for suspended 
in those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales and 
those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers the lake as i 
have hinted was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent and as human infants while suckling 
will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast as if leading two different lives 
at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still spiritually feasting upon some 
unearthly reminiscence so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us but 
not at us as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new 
born sight floating on their sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us one of 
these little infants that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old might have 
measured some fourteen feet in length and some six feet in girth he was a 
little frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position 
it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all 
ready for the final spring the unborn whale lies bent like a bow the delicate 
side fins and the palms of his flukes still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance 
of a ears newly arrived from foreign parts line cried queequeg looking over the gunwale 
fast him fast line him who struck whale one big one little ails ye man 
cried starbuck e here said queequeg pointing down as when the stricken whale that from 
the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he 
floats up again and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the 
air so now starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of madame leviathan by 
which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam not seldom in the rapid 
vicissitudes of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomes entangled with 
the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trapped some of the subtlest secrets 
of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond we saw young leviathan 
amours in the deep the sperm whale as with all other species of the leviathan 
but unlike most other fish breeds indifferently at all seasons after a gestation which may 
probably be set down at nine months producing but one at a time though in 
some few known instances giving birth to an esau and jacob contingency provided for in 
suckling by two teats curiously situated one on each side of the anus but the 
breasts themselves extend upwards from that when by chance these precious parts in a nursing 
whale are cut by the lance the pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea 
for rods the milk is very sweet and rich it has been tasted by man 
it might do well with strawberries when overflowing with mutual esteem the whales salute more 
hominum and thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights did these 
inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely 
revelled in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being 
do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planets 
of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and deep inland there i still bathe 
me in eternal mildness of joy meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden 
frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats still engaged in 
drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war 
within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them 
but the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and 
fro across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes it is 
sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to 
seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail tendon 
it is done by darting a short handled cutting spade to which is attached a 
rope for hauling it back again a whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this 
part but not effectually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along 
with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound 
he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado arnold at 
the battle of saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went but agonizing as was the wound 
of this whale and an appalling spectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with 
which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause 
which at first the intervening distance obscured from us but at length we perceived that 
by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery this whale had become entangled in 
the harpoon line that he towed he had also run away with the cutting spade 
in him and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon had 
permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon line round his tail the cutting spade 
itself had worked loose from his flesh so that tormented to madness he was now 
churning through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and tossing the keen spade 
about him wounding and murdering his own comrades this terrific object seemed to recall the 
whole herd from their stationary fright first the whales forming the margin of our lake 
began to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lifted by half 
spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell the 
submarine bridal chambers and nurseries vanished in more and more contracting orbits the whales in 
the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters yes the long calm was 
departing a low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the tumultuous masses 
of block ice when the great river hudson breaks up in spring the entire host 
of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre as if to pile themselves up in 
one common mountain instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places starbuck taking the stern oars he 
intensely whispered seizing the your oars and clutch your souls now my god men stand 
by shove him off you whale there him him stand up and stay so spring 
men never mind their them away the boat was now all but jammed between two 
vast black bulks leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long lengths but by desperate endeavor 
we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly and at the 
same time earnestly watching for another outlet after many similar hair breadth escapes we at 
last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles but now 
crossed by random whales all violently making for one centre this lucky salvation was cheaply 
purchased by the loss of hat who while standing in the bows to prick the 
fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by the air eddy made 
by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by riotous and disordered 
as the universal commotion now was it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic 
movement for having clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their 
onward flight with augmented fleetness further pursuit was useless but the boats still lingered in 
their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and likewise to 
secure one which flask had killed and waifed the waif is a pennoned pole two 
or three of which are carried by every boat and which when additional game is 
at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to 
mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should the 
boats of any other ship draw near the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative 
of that sagacious saying in the fishery more whales the less fish of all the 
drugged whales only one was captured the rest contrived to escape for the time but 
only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the 
pequod chapter 88 schools and schoolmasters the previous chapter gave account of an immense body 
or herd of sperm whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing 
those vast aggregations now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must 
have been seen even at the present day small detached bands are occasionally observed embracing 
from twenty to fifty individuals each such bands are known as schools they generally are 
of two sorts those composed almost entirely of females and those mustering none but young 
vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated in cavalier attendance upon the school 
of females you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude but not old who 
upon any alarm evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight 
of his ladies in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the 
watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem the contrast 
between this ottoman and his concubines is striking because while he is always of the 
largest leviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not more than one third 
of the bulk of an average sized male they are comparatively delicate indeed i dare 
say not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be 
denied that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point it is 
very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings like fashionables 
they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety you meet them 
on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season having 
just returned perhaps from spending the summer in the northern seas and so cheating summer 
of all unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have lounged up and down 
the promenade of the equator awhile they start for the oriental waters in anticipation of 
the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year when 
serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange suspicious sights are seen my 
lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young 
leviathan coming that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies with 
what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chases him away high times indeed if 
unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic 
bliss though do what the bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out 
of his bed for alas all fish bed in common as ashore the ladies often 
cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales who 
sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love they fence with their long lower 
jaws sometimes locking them together and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly 
interweave their antlers not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters 
heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched and dislocated mouths but supposing 
the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the 
lord then is it very diverting to watch that lord gently he insinuates his vast 
bulk among them again and revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario 
like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines granting other whales to be in 
sight the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these grand turks for these 
grand turks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small as 
for the sons and the daughters they beget why those sons and daughters must take 
care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for like certain other omnivorous 
roving lovers that might be named my lord whale has no taste for the nursery 
however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous 
babies all over the world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as the 
ardour of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reflection lends her solemn pauses 
in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk then a love of ease 
and virtue supplants the love for maidens our ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory 
stage of life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul 
goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers and warning each 
young leviathan from his amorous errors now as the harem of whales is called by 
the fishermen a school so is the lord and master of that school technically known 
as the schoolmaster it is therefore not in strict character however admirably satirical that after 
going to school himself he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there 
but the folly of it his title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the 
name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who first 
thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoirs of vidocq and 
informed himself what sort of a country schoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger 
days and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of 
his pupils the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in 
his advancing years is true of all aged sperm whales almost universally a lone a 
solitary leviathan is an ancient one like venerable moss bearded daniel boone he will have 
no one near him but nature herself and her he takes to wife in the 
wilderness of waters and the best of wives she is though she keeps so many 
moody secrets the schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously mentioned offer a 
strong contrast to the harem schools for while those female whales are characteristically timid the 
young males or forty barrel bulls as they call them are by far the most 
pugnacious of all leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous grey 
headed grizzled whales sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by 
a penal gout the forty barrel bull schools are larger than the harem schools like 
a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round 
the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them 
any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard they soon relinquish 
this turbulence though and when about three fourths grown break up and separately go about 
in quest of settlements that is harems another point of difference between the male and 
female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes say you strike a forty barrel 
devil all his comrades quit him but strike a member of the harem school and 
her companions swim around her with every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her 
and so long as themselves to fall a prey chapter 89 fast fish and loose 
fish the allusion to the waif and waif poles in the last chapter but one 
necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery of which the 
waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge it frequently happens that when several 
ships are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape 
and be finally killed and captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised many 
minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature for example a weary and perilous 
chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by 
reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a 
second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or 
line thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen were 
there not some written or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to all cases perhaps the 
only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment was that of holland it was decreed 
by the states general in a d 1695 but though no other nation has ever 
had any written whaling law yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and 
lawyers in this matter they have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses pandects 
and the by laws of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other 
business yes these laws might be engraven on a queen farthing or the barb of 
a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they i a fast fish 
belongs to the party fast to it ii a loose fish is fair game for 
anybody who can soonest catch it but what plays the mischief with this masterly code 
is the admirable brevity of it which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound 
it first what is a fast fish alive or dead a fish is technically fast 
when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all 
controllable by the occupant or occupants mast an oar a nine inch cable a telegraph 
wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the same likewise a fish is 
technically fast when it bears a waif or any other recognised symbol of possession so 
long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take 
it alongside as well as their intention so to do these are scientific commentaries but 
the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder coke upon 
littleton of the fist true among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowances are always 
made for peculiar cases where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party 
to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but others 
are by no means so scrupulous some fifty years ago there was a curious case 
of whale trover litigated in england wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard 
chase of a whale in the northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had 
succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of their lives obliged 
to forsake not only their lines but their boat itself ultimately the defendants the crew 
of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it 
before the very eyes of the plaintiffs and when those defendants were remonstrated with their 
captain snapped his fingers in the teeth and assured them that by way of doxology 
to the deed he had done he would now retain their line harpoons and boat 
which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the 
plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line harpoons and 
boat mr erskine was counsel for the defendants lord ellenborough was the judge in the 
course of the defence the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding 
to a recent crim con case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle 
his viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in the 
course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action to recover possession of 
her erskine was on the other side and he then supported it by saying that 
though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and 
only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned 
her yet abandon her he did so that she became a loose fish and therefore 
when a subsequent gentleman re harpooned her the lady then became that subsequent property along 
with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her now in the present case 
erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of 
each other these pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the very learned judge 
in set terms decided to wit as for the boat he awarded it to the 
plaintiffs because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives but that with regard 
to the controverted whale harpoons and line they belonged to the defendants the whale because 
it was a loose fish at the time of the final capture and the harpoons 
and line because when the fish made off with them it the fish acquired a 
property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right 
to them now the defendants afterwards took the fish ergo the aforesaid articles were theirs 
a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly object 
to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter the two great 
principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted and applied and elucidated by 
lord ellenborough in the above cited case these two laws touching fast fish and loose 
fish i say will on reflection be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence for 
notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture the temple of the law like the temple of 
the philistines has but two props to stand on is it not a saying in 
every mouth possession is half of the law that is regardless of how the thing 
came into possession but often possession is the whole of the law what are the 
sinews and souls of russian serfs and republican slaves but fast fish whereof possession is 
the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the last mite but 
a fast fish what is yonder undetected marble mansion with a door plate for a 
waif what is that but a fast fish what is the ruinous discount which mordecai 
the broker gets from poor woebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep family from 
starvation what is that ruinous discount but a fast fish what is the archbishop of 
income of 000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of 
broken backed laborers all sure of heaven without any of help what is that globular 
000 but a fast fish what are the duke of hereditary towns and hamlets but 
fast fish what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor ireland but a fast 
fish what to that apostolic lancer brother jonathan is texas but a fast fish and 
concerning all these is not possession the whole of the law but if the doctrine 
of fast fish be pretty generally applicable the kindred doctrine of loose fish is still 
more widely so that is internationally and universally applicable what was america in 1492 but 
a loose fish in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waifing it 
for his royal master and mistress what was poland to the czar what greece to 
the turk what india to england what at last will mexico be to the united 
states all loose fish what are the rights of man and the liberties of the 
world but loose fish what all minds and opinions but loose fish what is the 
principle of religious belief in them but a loose fish what to the ostentatious smuggling 
verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but loose fish what is the great globe itself 
but a loose fish and what are you reader but a loose fish and a 
fast fish too chapter 90 heads or tails balena vero sufficit si rex habeat caput 
et regina caudam bracton l 3 c 3 latin from the books of the laws 
of england which taken along with the context means that of all whales captured by 
anybody on the coast of that land the king as honorary grand harpooneer must have 
the head and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a division which in 
the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate remainder now as 
this law under a modified form is to this day in force in england and 
as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast 
and loose fish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same 
courteous principle that prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separate 
car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the first place in curious proof 
of the fact that the above mentioned law is still in force i proceed to 
lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years it seems that 
some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some one of the cinque ports had 
after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had 
originally descried afar off from the shore now the cinque ports are partially or somehow 
under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord warden holding 
the office directly from the crown i believe all the royal emoluments incident to the 
cinque port territories become by assignment his by some writers this office is called a 
sinecure but not so because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing 
his perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them now 
when these poor sun burnt mariners bare footed and with their trowsers rolled high up 
on their eely legs had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry promising themselves 
a good from the precious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with 
their wives and good ale with their cronies upon the strength of their respective shares 
up steps a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman with a copy of 
blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the head he off this fish my 
masters is a fast fish i seize it as the lord upon this the poor 
mariners in their respectful truly not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their heads 
all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger but that did in 
nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman 
with the copy of blackstone at length one of them after long scratching about for 
his ideas made bold to speak sir who is the lord warden duke the duke 
had nothing to do with taking this fish is his have been at great trouble 
and peril and some expense and is all that to go to the benefit we 
getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters is his the duke so 
very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood is 
his thought to relieve my old bed ridden mother by part of my share of 
this whale is his the duke be content with a quarter or a half is 
his in a word the whale was seized and sold and his grace the duke 
of wellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particular lights the case might 
by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed under the circumstances a rather 
hard one an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace 
begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration to which 
my lord duke in substance replied both letters were published that he had already done 
so and received the money and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for 
the future he the reverend gentleman would decline meddling with other business is this the 
still militant old man standing at the corners of the three kingdoms on all hands 
coercing alms of beggars it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged 
right of the duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign we 
must needs inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right 
the law itself has already been set forth but plowdon gives us the reason for 
it says plowdon the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen of its 
superior excellence and by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument 
in such matters but why should the king have the head and the queen the 
tail a reason for that ye lawyers in his treatise on gold or queen pinmoney 
an old bench author one william prynne thus discourseth tail is ye that ye wardrobe 
may be supplied with ye whalebone now this was written at a time when the 
black limber bone of the greenland or right whale was largely used in bodices but 
this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is 
a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid 
to be presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here there are two 
royal fish so styled by the english law whale and the sturgeon both royal property 
under certain limitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the ordinary revenue i know 
not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by inference it seems 
to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale 
the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically 
regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there seems a 
reason in all things even in law chapter 91 the pequod meets the rose bud 
vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this leviathan insufferable fetor 
denying not inquiry sir t browne v e it was a week or two after 
the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapory 
mid day sea that the many noses on the deck proved more vigilant discoverers than 
the three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt 
in the sea will bet something now said stubb somewhere hereabouts are some of those 
drugged whales we tickled the other day i thought they would keel up before long 
presently the vapors in advance slid aside and there in the distance lay a ship 
whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside as we glided 
nearer the stranger showed french colours from his peak and by the eddying cloud of 
vulture sea fowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that 
the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that is a 
whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse it 
may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than 
an assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed 
so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to 
moor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the 
fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and 
by no means of the nature of attar of rose coming still nearer with the 
expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second 
whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out 
to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with 
a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of 
anything like oil nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman 
will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he 
may shun blasted whales in general the pequod had now swept so nigh to the 
stranger that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade pole entangled in the lines that 
were knotted round the tail of one of these whales a pretty fellow now he 
banteringly laughed standing in the bows a jackal for ye i well know that these 
crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes lowering their boats for 
breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yes and sometimes sailing from their port with 
their hold full of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all 
the oil they will get be enough to dip the wick into aye we all 
know these things but look ye a crappo that is content with our leavings the 
drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bones 
of that other precious fish he has there poor devil i say pass round a 
hat some one and make him a present of a little oil for dear sake 
for what oil get from that drugged whale there be fit to burn in a 
jail no not in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why agree 
to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours 
than get from that bundle of bones though now that i think of it it 
may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris i wonder now 
if our old man has thought of that worth trying yes for it and so 
saying he started for the quarter deck by this time the faint air had become 
a complete calm so that whether or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in 
the smell with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from 
the cabin stubb now called his crew and pulled off for the stranger drawing across 
her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste the upper part 
of her stem piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk was 
painted green and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there the 
whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour upon her head 
boards in large gilt letters he read de rose button or rose bud and this 
was the romantic name of this aromatic ship though stubb did not understand the bouton 
part of the inscription yet the word rose and the bulbous figure head put together 
sufficiently explained the whole to him wooden rose bud eh he cried with his hand 
to his nose will do very well but how like all creation it smells now 
in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck he had to pull 
round the bows to the starboard side and thus come close to the blasted whale 
and so talk over it arrived then at this spot with one hand still to 
his nose he de rose ahoy are there any of you bouton de roses that 
speak english rejoined a guernsey man from the bulwarks who turned out to be the 
chief mate then my bouton de rose bud have you seen the white whale what 
whale white sperm dick have ye seen him heard of such a whale cachalot blanche 
white good then good bye now and call again in a minute then rapidly pulling 
back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning over the quarter deck rail awaiting his 
report he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and sir no upon which ahab 
retired and stubb returned to the frenchman he now perceived that the guernsey man who 
had just got into the chains and was using a cutting spade had slung his 
nose in a sort of bag the matter with your nose there said stubb it 
wish it was broken or that i have any nose at all answered the guernsey 
man who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much what 
are you holding yours for nothing a wax nose i have to hold it on 
fine day it air rather gardenny i should say throw us a bunch of posies 
will ye bouton de rose in the name do you want here roared the guernseyman 
flying into a sudden passion keep yes the word why you pack those whales in 
ice while working at but joking aside though do you know rose bud that all 
nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales as for that dried up 
one there he a gill in his whole carcase know that well enough but see 
the captain here believe it this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer 
before but come aboard and mayhap believe you if he me and so get out 
of this dirty scrape to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb and 
with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene presented itself the 
sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for 
the whales but they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything 
but a good humor all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many 
jib booms now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up 
to the mast head to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the 
plague dipped oakum in coal tar and at intervals held it to their nostrils others 
having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl were vigorously 
puffing tobacco smoke so that it constantly filled their olfactories stubb was struck by a 
shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the round house abaft and looking in that 
direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from 
within this was the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of 
the day had betaken himself to the round house cabinet he called it to avoid 
the pest but still could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times 
marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the guernsey man 
had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of 
his captain as a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and 
unprofitable a pickle sounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernsey man had not 
the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore held his peace on that head but 
otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a 
little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all dreaming of 
distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan of theirs the guernsey man under cover 
of an office was to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from 
stubb and as for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost 
in him during the interview by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin 
he was a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a sea captain 
with large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch 
seals at his side to this gentleman stubb was now politely introduced by the guernsey 
man who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them shall i 
say to him first said he said stubb eyeing the velvet vest and the watch 
and seals may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of 
babyish to me though i pretend to be a judge says monsieur said the guernsey 
man in french turning to his captain only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose 
captain and chief mate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from 
a blasted whale they had brought alongside upon this the captain started and eagerly desired 
to know more now said the guernsey man to stubb since he takes it so 
easy tell him that now i have eyed him carefully quite certain that no more 
fit to command a whale ship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him 
from me a baboon vows and declares monsieur that the other whale the dried one 
is far more deadly than the blasted one in fine monsieur he conjures us as 
we value our lives to cut loose from these fish instantly the captain ran forward 
and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting tackles 
and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship 
now said the guernsey man when the captain had returned to them let me see 
yes you may as well tell him now fact tell him diddled him and aside 
to himself perhaps somebody else says monsieur that very happy to have been of any 
service to us hearing this the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties meaning 
himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a 
bottle of bordeaux wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the 
interpreter him heartily but tell him against my principles to drink with the man diddled 
in fact tell him i must go says monsieur that his principles admit of his 
drinking but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieur had 
best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for so 
calm they drift by this time stubb was over the side and getting into his 
boat hailed the guernsey man to this effect having a long tow line in his 
boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter 
whale of the two from the side while the boats then were engaged in towing 
the ship one way stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously 
slacking out a most unusually long tow line presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned 
to cast off from the whale hoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance 
while the pequod slid in between him and whale whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the 
floating body and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions at once proceeded 
to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boat spade he commenced 
an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almost have 
thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his 
spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old roman tiles and 
pottery buried in fat english loam his crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping 
their chief and looking as anxious as gold hunters and all the time numberless fowls 
were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginning 
to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very 
heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the 
tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will flow into 
and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time have 
it i have it cried stubb with delight striking something in the subterranean regions purse 
a purse dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls of 
something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and 
savory withal you might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a hue 
between yellow and ash colour and this good friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea 
an ounce to any druggist some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lost 
in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for 
impatient loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would 
bid them good bye chapter 92 ambergris now this ambergris is a very curious substance 
and so important as an article of commerce that in 1791 a certain nantucket born 
captain coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that 
subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin 
of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned though the word ambergris 
is but the french compound for grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct 
for amber though at times found on the sea coast is also dug up in 
some far inland soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides amber 
is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouth pieces to pipes for beads 
and ornaments but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it 
is largely used in perfumery in pastiles precious candles hair powders and pomatum the turks 
use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same purpose that 
frankincense is carried to st in rome some wine merchants drop a few grains into 
claret to flavor it who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should 
regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale yet 
so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others 
the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such a dyspepsia it 
were hard to say unless by administering three or four boat loads of pills and 
then running out of way as laborers do in blasting rocks i have forgotten to 
say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard round bony plates which at 
first stubb thought might be trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they were 
nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner now that the 
incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay 
is this nothing bethink thee of that saying of st paul in corinthians about corruption 
and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonor but raised in glory and likewise 
call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best 
musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill savor cologne 
water in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the worst i should like to conclude the 
chapter with the above appeal but cannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge 
often made against whalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased minds might 
be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the two whales elsewhere 
in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is 
throughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut they hint that 
all whales always smell bad now how did this odious stigma originate i opine that 
it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the greenland whaling ships in london 
more than two centuries ago because those whalemen did not then and do not now 
try out their oil at sea as the southern ships have always done but cutting 
up the fresh blubber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large 
casks and carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those 
icy seas and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed forbidding any 
other course the consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of 
these whale cemeteries in the greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to 
that arising from excavating an old city grave yard for the foundations of a lying 
in hospital i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise 
imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former times of a dutch 
village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned 
fogo von slack in his great work on smells a text book on that subject 
as its name imports smeer fat berg to put up this village was founded in 
order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be 
tried out without being taken home to holland for that purpose it was a collection 
of furnaces fat kettles and oil sheds and when the works were in full operation 
certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor but all this is quite different with a 
south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four years perhaps after completely filling 
her hold with oil does not perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling 
out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless the 
truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whales as a species are 
by no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the people 
of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company by the nose 
nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing 
he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it 
is true seldom in the open air i say that the motion of a sperm 
flukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a musk scented lady rustles her dress 
in a warm parlor what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance 
considering his magnitude must it not be to that famous elephant with jewelled tusks and 
redolent with myrrh which was led out of an indian town to do honor to 
alexander the great chapter 93 the castaway it was but some few days after encountering 
the frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the crew an 
event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft 
with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own 
now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats 
some few hands are reserved called ship keepers whose province it is to work the 
vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a general thing these ship keepers 
are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the crews but if there happen to 
be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain 
to be made a ship keeper it was so in the pequod with the little 
negro pippin by nick name pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him 
before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomy jolly in outer 
aspect pip and dough boy made a match like a black pony and a white 
one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour driven in one eccentric span but while 
hapless dough boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects pip though over 
tender hearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to 
his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer freer relish 
than any other race for blacks the calendar should show naught but three hundred and 
sixty five fourth of julys and new days nor smile so while i write that 
this little black was brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony 
panelled in cabinets but pip loved life and all peaceable securities so that the panic 
striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurred his 
brightness though as ere long will be seen what was thus temporarily subdued in him 
in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires that fictitiously 
showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland 
county in connecticut he had once enlivened many a frolic on the green and at 
melodious even tide with his gay ha ha had turned the round horizon into one 
star belled tambourine so though in the clear air of day suspended against a blue 
veined neck the pure watered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller 
would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a 
gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural 
gases then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb then the evil blazing diamond once 
the divinest symbol of the crystal skies looks like some crown jewel stolen from the 
king of hell but let us to the story it came to pass that in 
the ambergris affair after oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand as for a time 
to become quite maimed and temporarily pip was put into his place the first time 
stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close 
contact with the whale and therefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observing him 
took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost for he 
might often find it needful now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the 
whale and as the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which 
happened in this instance to be right under poor seat the involuntary consternation of the 
moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such 
a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted 
it overboard with him so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping 
into the water that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line 
swiftly straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the 
boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turns around his chest 
and neck tashtego stood in the bows he was full of the fire of the 
hunt he hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boat knife from its sheath he 
suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb exclaimed interrogatively meantime blue 
choked face plainly looked do for sake all passed in a flash in less than 
half a minute this entire thing happened him cut roared stubb and so the whale 
was lost and pip was saved so soon as he recovered himself the poor little 
negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings 
to evaporate stubb then in a plain business like but still half humorous manner cursed 
pip officially and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance was never 
jump from a boat pip all the rest was indefinite as the soundest advice ever 
is now in general stick to the boat is your true motto in whaling but 
cases will sometimes happen when leap from the boat is still better moreover as if 
perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would 
be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly 
dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command to the boat pip or by 
the lord i pick you up if you jump mind that we afford to lose 
whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for thirty times what you 
would pip in alabama bear that in mind and jump any more hereby perhaps stubb 
indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a money making animal 
which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence but we are all in the hands 
of the gods and pip jumped again it was under very similar circumstances to the 
first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when 
the whale started to run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried 
trunk alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautiful bounteous 
blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away all round to 
the horizon like gold skin hammered out to the extremest bobbing up and down in 
that sea ebon head showed like a head of cloves no boat knife was lifted 
when he fell so rapidly astern inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale 
was winged in three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and 
stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his crisp curling black 
head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest now in 
calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer 
as to ride in a spring carriage ashore but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable the 
intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my god who 
can tell it mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open 
how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides but had stubb 
really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he did not mean to 
at least because there were two boats in his wake and he supposed no doubt 
that they would of course come up to pip very quickly and pick him up 
though indeed such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested 
by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances not unfrequently occur almost invariably 
in the fishery a coward so called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar 
to military navies and armies but it so happened that those boats without seeing pip 
suddenly spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and boat 
was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his 
fish that ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably by the merest chance the 
ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about 
the deck an idiot such at least they said he was the sea had jeeringly 
kept his finite body up but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely 
though rather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of the unwarped primal 
world glided to and fro before his passive eyes and the miser merman wisdom revealed 
his hoarded heaps and among the joyous heartless ever juvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous 
god omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs 
he saw foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his 
shipmates called him mad so insanity is sense and wandering from all mortal reason man 
comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and 
weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his god for the rest blame not 
stubb too hardly the thing is common in that fishery and in the sequel of 
the narrative it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself chapter 94 a 
squeeze of the hand that whale of so dearly purchased was duly brought to the 
side where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed were regularly gone through even 
to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case while some were occupied with this 
latter duty others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled 
with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated 
ere going to the try works of which anon it had cooled and crystallized to 
such a degree that when with several others i sat down before a large bath 
of it i found it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in 
the liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid a 
sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old times this sperm was such a 
favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener such a softener such a delicious molifier 
after having my hands in it for only a few minutes my fingers felt like 
eels and began as it were to serpentine and spiralise as i sat there at 
my ease cross legged on the deck after the bitter exertion at the windlass under 
a blue tranquil sky the ship under indolent sail and gliding so serenely along as 
i bathed my hands among those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almost within 
the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged all their opulence like 
fully ripe grapes their wine as i snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma and truly like 
the smell of spring violets i declare to you that for the time i lived 
as in a musky meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible 
sperm i washed my hands and my heart of it i almost began to credit 
the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of 
anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from all ill will or 
petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i 
squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till 
a strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my 
co hands in it mistaking their hands for the gentle globules such an abounding affectionate 
friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last i was continually squeezing their 
hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as much as to say my dear 
fellow beings why should we longer cherish any social acerbities or know the slightest ill 
humor or envy come let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze 
ourselves into each other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm 
of kindness would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since 
by many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all cases man must eventually 
lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in 
the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table 
the saddle the fireside the country now that i have perceived all this i am 
ready to squeeze case eternally in thoughts of the visions of the night i saw 
long rows of angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti 
now while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akin to it 
in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try works first comes white 
horse so called which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish and also 
from the thicker portions of his flukes it is tough with congealed wad of still 
contains some oil after being severed from the whale the white horse is first cut 
into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer they look much like blocks of berkshire 
marble plum pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the flesh here 
and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree 
in its unctuousness it is a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold as its 
name imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked snowy and 
golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple it is plums of 
rubies in pictures of citron spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from 
eating it i confess that once i stole behind the foremast to try it it 
tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le 
gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after the 
venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the 
vineyards of champagne there is another substance and a very singular one which turns up 
in the course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling 
adequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even 
so is the nature of the substance it is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most 
frequently found in the tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting i 
hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the case coalescing gurry so 
called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but sometimes incidentally used by the 
sperm fishermen it designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of 
the greenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior 
souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan nippers strictly this word is not indigenous to the 
vocabulary but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a nipper is a short firm 
strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of tail it averages an inch 
in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of 
a hoe edgewise moved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and 
by nameless blandishments as of magic allures along with it all impurities but to learn 
all about these recondite matters your best way is at once to descend into the 
blubber room and have a long talk with its inmates this place has previously been 
mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket pieces when stript and hoisted from the whale 
when the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a scene 
of terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit by a dull 
lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen they generally go in pairs 
pike and gaffman and a spade man the whaling pike is similar to a boarding 
weapon of the same name the gaff is something like a boat hook with his 
gaff the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it 
from slipping as the ship pitches and lurches about meanwhile the spade man stands on 
the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse pieces this spade is sharp 
as hone can make it the feet are shoeless the thing he stands on will 
sometimes irresistibly slide away from him like a sledge if he cuts off one of 
his own toes or one of his would you be very much astonished toes are 
scarce among veteran blubber room men chapter 95 the cassock had you stepped on board 
the pequod at a certain juncture of this post mortemizing of the whale and had 
you strolled forward nigh the windlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned 
with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen there 
lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers not the wondrous cistern in the huge head 
not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail 
none of these would so surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone 
than a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jet 
black as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it is or 
rather in old times its likeness was such an idol as that found in the 
secret groves of queen maachah in judea and for worshipping which king asa her son 
did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abomination at the 
brook kedron as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the first book of 
kings look at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and assisted by 
two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners call it and with bowed shoulders 
staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from 
the field extending it upon the forecastle deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its 
dark pelt as an african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turns 
the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as 
almost to double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in the rigging 
to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some three feet of it 
towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slits for arm holes at the other 
end he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it the mincer now stands before you invested 
in the full canonicals of his calling immemorial to all his order this investiture alone 
will adequately protect him while employed in the peculiar functions of his office that office 
consists in mincing the horse pieces of blubber for the pots an operation which is 
conducted at a curious wooden horse planted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious 
tub beneath it into which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a 
rapt desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves what 
a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a pope were this mincer bible 
leaves bible leaves this is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer it 
enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as thin slices as possible 
inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated 
and its quantity considerably increased besides perhaps improving it in quality chapter 96 the try 
works besides her hoisted boats an american whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try works 
she presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp 
in constituting the completed ship it is as if from the open field a brick 
kiln were transported to her planks the try works are planted between the foremast and 
mainmast the most roomy part of the deck the timbers beneath are of a peculiar 
strength fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar 
some ten feet by eight square and five in height the foundation does not penetrate 
the deck but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of 
iron bracing it on all sides and screwing it down to the timbers on the 
flanks it is cased with wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping 
battened hatchway removing this hatch we expose the great try pots two in number and 
each of several capacity when not in use they are kept remarkably clean sometimes they 
are polished with soapstone and sand till they shine within like silver punch bowls during 
the night watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away 
there for a nap while employed in polishing man in each pot side by confidential 
communications are carried on over the iron lips it is a place also for profound 
mathematical meditation it was in the left hand try pot of the pequod with the 
soapstone diligently circling round me that i was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact 
that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend 
from any point in precisely the same time removing the fire board from the front 
of the try works the bare masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the 
two iron mouths of the furnaces directly underneath the pots these mouths are fitted with 
heavy doors of iron the intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself 
to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface 
of the works by a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished 
with water as fast as it evaporates there are no external chimneys they open direct 
from the rear wall and here let us go back for a moment it was 
about nine at night that the try works were first started on this present voyage 
it belonged to stubb to oversee the business ready there off hatch then and start 
her you cook fire the works this was an easy thing for the carpenter had 
been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said that 
in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try works has to be fed 
for a time with wood after that no wood is used except as a means 
of quick ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out the 
crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters still contains considerable of its unctuous properties 
these fritters feed the flames like a plethoric burning martyr or a self consuming misanthrope 
once ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body would 
that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horrible to inhale and inhale 
it you must and not only that but you must live in it for the 
time it has an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about it such as may lurk in 
the vicinity of funereal pyres it smells like the left wing of the day of 
judgment it is an argument for the pit by midnight the works were in full 
operation we were clear from the carcase sail had been made the wind was freshening 
the wild ocean darkness was intense but that darkness was licked up by the fierce 
flames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues and illuminated every lofty rope 
in the rigging as with the famed greek fire the burning ship drove on as 
if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphur freighted brigs of 
the bold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad sheets of flame for 
sails bore down upon the turkish frigates and folded them in conflagrations the hatch removed 
from the top of the works now afforded a wide hearth in front of them 
standing on this were the tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers always the whale stokers 
with huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots or 
stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flames darted curling out of the doors 
to catch them by the feet the smoke rolled away in sullen heaps to every 
pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all 
eagerness to leap into their faces opposite the mouth of the works on the further 
side of the wide wooden hearth was the windlass this served for a sea sofa 
here lounged the watch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the 
fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads their tawny features now all begrimed 
with smoke and sweat their matted beards and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth 
all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works as they narrated 
to each other their unholy adventures their tales of terror told in words of mirth 
as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the flames from the furnace 
as to and fro in their front the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged 
forks and dippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship 
groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the 
blackness of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in her 
mouth and viciously spat round her on all sides then the rushing pequod freighted with 
savages and laden with fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of 
darkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac soul so seemed it to me as 
i stood at her helm and for long hours silently guided the way of this 
fire ship on the sea wrapped for that interval in darkness myself i but the 
better saw the redness the madness the ghastliness of others the continual sight of the 
fiend shapes before me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last 
begat kindred visions in my soul so soon as i began to yield to that 
unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm but that night 
in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable thing occurred to me starting from a 
brief standing sleep i was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jaw bone tiller 
smote my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum of 
sails just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eyes were open i 
was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still 
further apart but spite of all this i could see no compass before me to 
steer by though it seemed but a minute since i had been watching the card 
by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom 
now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness uppermost was the impression that whatever 
swift rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead 
as rushing from all havens astern a stark bewildered feeling as of death came over 
me convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazy conceit that the tiller 
was somehow in some enchanted way inverted my god what is the matter with me 
thought i lo in my brief sleep i had turned myself about and was fronting 
the stern with my back to her prow and the compass in an instant i 
faced back just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind 
and very probably capsizing her how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural 
hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee look 
not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thy 
hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first hint 
of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when its redness makes all things 
look ghastly to morrow in the natural sun the skies will be bright those who 
glared like devils in the forking flames the morn will show in far other at 
least gentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only true others but liars nevertheless 
the sun hides not dismal swamp nor accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the 
millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon the sun hides not 
the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds 
of this earth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow 
in him that mortal man cannot be true or undeveloped with books the same the 
truest of all men was the man of sorrows and the truest of all books 
is and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe is vanity all this wilful 
world hath not got hold of unchristian wisdom yet but he who dodges hospitals and 
jails and walks fast crossing graveyards and would rather talk of operas than hell calls 
cowper young pascal rousseau poor devils all of sick men and throughout a care free 
lifetime swears by rabelais as passing wise and therefore jolly that man is fitted to 
sit down on tomb stones and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous solomon 
but even solomon he says man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall 
i e even while living the congregation of the dead give not thyself up then 
to fire lest it invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me 
there is a wisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness 
and there is a catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into 
the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny 
spaces and even if he for ever flies within the gorge that gorge is in 
the mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher 
than other birds upon the plain even though they soar chapter 97 the lamp had 
you descended from the try works to the forecastle where the off duty watch were 
sleeping for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some 
illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors there they lay in their triangular oaken vaults 
each mariner a chiselled muteness a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes in 
merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens to dress 
in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in darkness to his pallet 
this is his usual lot but the whaleman as he seeks the food of light 
so he lives in light he makes his berth an lamp and lays him down 
in it so that in the pitchiest night the black hull still houses an illumination 
see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of but old bottles and 
vials the copper cooler at the try works and replenishes them there as mugs of 
ale at a vat he burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufactured and 
therefore unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral contrivances ashore it is 
sweet as early grass butter in april he goes and hunts for his oil so 
as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness even as the traveller on the 
prairie hunts up his own supper of game chapter 98 stowing down and clearing up 
already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the 
mast head how he is chased over the watery moors and slaughtered in the valleys 
of the deep how he is then towed alongside and beheaded and how on the 
principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was 
killed his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time 
he is condemned to the pots and like shadrach meshach and abednego his spermaceti oil 
and bone pass unscathed through the fire now it remains to conclude the last chapter 
of this part of the description by if i romantic proceeding of decanting off his 
oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold where once again leviathan 
returns to his native profundities sliding along beneath the surface as before but alas never 
more to rise and blow while still warm the oil like hot punch is received 
into the six barrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling this 
way and that in the midnight sea the enormous casks are slewed round and headed 
over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck like so many 
land slides till at last man handled and stayed in their course and all round 
the hoops rap rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now 
ex officio every sailor is a cooper at length when the last pint is casked 
and all is cool then the great hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship 
are thrown open and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea 
this done the hatches are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up in 
the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the 
business of whaling one day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil on 
the sacred quarter deck enormous masses of the head are profanely piled great rusty casks 
lie about as in a brewery yard the smoke from the try works has besooted 
all the bulwarks the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness the entire ship seems great 
leviathan himself while on all hands the din is deafening but a day or two 
after you look about you and prick your ears in this self same ship and 
were it not for the tell tale boats and try works you would all but 
swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured 
sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue this is the reason why the decks never 
look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil besides from 
the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale a potent lye is readily made 
and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side 
that lye quickly exterminates it hands go diligently along the bulwarks and with buckets of 
water and rags restore them to their full tidiness the soot is brushed from the 
lower rigging all the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed 
and put away the great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try works completely 
hiding the pots every cask is out of sight all tackles are coiled in unseen 
nooks and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire company the 
whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew themselves proceed to 
their own ablutions shift themselves from top to toe and finally issue to the immaculate 
deck fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms new leaped from out the daintiest holland now 
with elated step they pace the planks in twos and threes and humorously discourse of 
parlors sofas carpets and fine cambrics propose to mat the deck think of having hanging 
to the top object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the 
forecastle to hint to such musked mariners of oil and bone and blubber were little 
short of audacity they know not the thing you distantly allude to away and bring 
us napkins but mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men intent 
on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken 
furniture and drop at least one small grease spot somewhere yes and many is the 
time when after the severest uninterrupted labors which know no night continuing straight through for 
ninety six hours when from the boat where they have swelled their wrists with all 
day rowing on the line only step to the deck to carry vast chains and 
heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea and in their very sweatings to 
be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the 
equatorial try works when on the heel of all this they have finally bestirred themselves 
to cleanse the ship and make a spotless dairy room of it many is the 
time the poor fellows just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks are startled by 
the cry of she blows and away they fly to fight another whale and go 
through the whole weary thing again oh my friends but this is man killing yet 
this is life for hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this vast 
bulk its small but valuable sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from its 
defilements and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul hardly is this 
done there she blows ghost is spouted up and away we sail to fight some 
other world and go through young old routine again oh the metempsychosis oh pythagoras that 
in bright greece two thousand years ago did die so good so wise so mild 
i sailed with thee along the peruvian coast last foolish as i am taught thee 
a green simple boy how to splice a rope chapter 99 the doubloon ere now 
it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarter deck taking regular 
turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other things 
requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks when most 
plunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and 
stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the binnacle 
with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass that glance shot like 
a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walk he 
again paused before the mainmast then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted 
gold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only dashed with 
a certain wild longing if not hopefulness but one morning turning to pass the doubloon 
he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it 
as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac 
way whatever significance might lurk in them and some certain significance lurks in all things 
else all things are little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher 
except to sell by the cartload as they do hills about boston to fill up 
some morass in the milky way now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked 
somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands 
the head waters of many a pactolus flows and though now nailed amidst all the 
rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet untouchable and immaculate to 
any foulness it still preserved its quito glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew 
and every hour passed by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick 
darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the 
sunset left it last for it was set apart and sanctified to one awe striking 
end and however wanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it 
as the white talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night 
wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to 
spend it now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the 
sun and tropic token pieces here palms alpacas and volcanoes disks and stars ecliptics horns 
of plenty and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious 
gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those 
fancy mints so spanishly poetic it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was 
a most wealthy example of these things on its round border it bore the letters 
republica del ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a country planted in the 
middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it 
had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn 
zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three summits from one a flame 
a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while arching over all was 
a segment of the partitioned zodiac the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and 
the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at libra before this equatorial coin ahab not 
unobserved by others was now pausing something ever egotistical in mountain tops and towers and 
all other grand and lofty things look here peaks as proud as lucifer the firm 
tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the courageous the undaunted and victorious 
fowl that too is ahab all are ahab and this round gold is but the 
image of the rounder globe which like a glass to each and every man in 
turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self great pains small gains for those who 
ask the world to solve them it cannot solve itself methinks now this coined sun 
wears a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign of storms the equinox 
and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at aries from 
storm to storm so be it then born in throes fit that man should live 
in pains and die in pangs so be it then stout stuff for woe to 
work on so be it then fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but claws 
must have left their mouldings there since yesterday murmured starbuck to himself leaning against the 
bulwarks old man seems to read awful writing i have never marked the coin inspectingly 
he goes below let me read a dark valley between three mighty heaven abiding peaks 
that almost seem the trinity in some faint earthly symbol so in this vale of 
death god girds us round and over all our gloom the sun of righteousness still 
shines a beacon and a hope if we bend down our eyes the dark vale 
shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance 
half way to cheer yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at 
midnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in 
vain this coin speaks wisely mildly truly but still sadly to me i will quit 
it lest truth shake me falsely the old mogul soliloquized stubb by the try works 
been twigging it and there goes starbuck from the same and both with faces which 
i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long and all from looking at 
a piece of gold which did i have it now on negro hill or in 
hook not look at it very long ere spending it humph in my poor insignificant 
opinion i regard this as queer i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings 
your doubloons of old spain your doubloons of peru your doubloons of chili your doubloons 
of bolivia your doubloons of popayan with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles and joes 
and half joes and quarter joes what then should there be in this doubloon of 
the equator that is so killing wonderful by golconda let me read it once halloa 
signs and wonders truly that now is what old bowditch in his epitome calls the 
zodiac and what my almanac below calls ditto get the almanac and as i have 
heard devils can be raised with arithmetic try my hand at raising a meaning out 
of these queer curvicues here with the massachusetts calendar the book see now signs and 
wonders and the sun always among hem hem hem here they they alive or the 
ram taurus or the bull and jimimi gemini himself or the twins well the sun 
he wheels among aye here on the coin just crossing the threshold between two of 
twelve sitting rooms all in a ring book you lie there the fact is you 
books must know your places do to give us the bare words and facts but 
we come in to supply the thoughts my small experience so far as the massachusetts 
calendar and navigator and arithmetic go signs and wonders eh pity if there is nothing 
wonderful in signs and significant in wonders a clue somewhere wait a bit by jove 
i have it look you doubloon your zodiac here is the life of man in 
one round chapter and now read it off straight out of the book come almanack 
to begin aries or the dog he begets us then taurus or the bumps us 
the first thing then gemini or the is virtue and vice we try to reach 
virtue when lo comes cancer the crab and drags us back and here going from 
virtue leo a roaring lion lies in the gives a few fierce bites and surly 
dabs with his paw we escape and hail virgo the virgin our first love we 
marry and think to be happy for aye when pop comes libra or the weighed 
and found wanting and while we are very sad about that lord how we suddenly 
jump as scorpio or the scorpion stings us in the rear we are curing the 
wound when whang come the arrows all round sagittarius or the archer is amusing himself 
as we pluck out the shafts stand aside the battering ram capricornus or the goat 
full tilt he comes rushing and headlong we are tossed when aquarius or the water 
bearer pours out his whole deluge and drowns us and to wind up with pisces 
or the fishes we sleep a sermon now writ in high heaven and the sun 
goes through it every year and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty 
jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trouble and so alow here does jolly 
stubb oh the word for aye adieu doubloon but stop here comes little king post 
dodge round the try works now and hear what have to say there before it 
out with something presently so so beginning see nothing here but a round thing made 
of gold and whoever raises a certain whale this round thing belongs to him so 
all this staring been about it is worth sixteen dollars true and at two cents 
the cigar nine hundred and sixty cigars i smoke dirty pipes like stubb but i 
like cigars and nine hundred and sixty of them so here goes flask aloft to 
spy out i call that wise or foolish now if it be really wise it 
has a foolish look to it yet if it be really foolish then has it 
a sort of wiseish look to it but avast here comes our old old hearse 
driver he must have been that is before he took to the sea he luffs 
up before the doubloon halloa and goes round on the other side of the mast 
why a horse shoe nailed on that side and now back again what does that 
mean hark like an old worn out coffee mill prick ears and listen the white 
whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when the sun 
stands in some one of these signs studied signs and know their marks they were 
taught me two score years ago by the old witch in copenhagen now in what 
sign will the sun then be the horse shoe sign for there it is right 
opposite the gold and the horse shoe sign the lion is the horse shoe roaring 
and devouring lion ship old ship my old head shakes to think of thee another 
rendering now but still one text all sorts of men in one kind of world 
you see dodge again here comes like the signs of the zodiac himself what says 
the cannibal as i live comparing notes looking at his thigh bone thinks the sun 
is in the thigh or in the calf or in the bowels i suppose as 
the old women talk astronomy in the back country and by jove found something there 
in the vicinity of his guess sagittarius or the archer no he know what to 
make of the doubloon he takes it for an old button off some trowsers but 
aside again here comes that ghost devil fedallah tail coiled out of sight as usual 
oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual what does he say with that 
look of his ah only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself there 
is a sun on the worshipper depend upon it ho more and more this way 
comes boy would he had died or i half horrible to me he too has 
been watching all of these look now he comes to read with that unearthly idiot 
face stand away again and hear him hark look you look he looks we look 
ye look they look my soul been studying grammar improving his mind poor fellow but 
that he says look you look he looks we look ye look they look getting 
it by again look you look he looks we look ye look they look funny 
i you and he and we ye and they are all bats and a crow 
especially when i stand of this pine tree here caw caw caw caw caw caw 
i a crow and the scare crow there he stands two bones stuck into a 
pair of old trowsers and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket 
if he means me lad could go hang myself any way for the present quit 
vicinity i can stand the rest for they have plain wits but too crazy witty 
for my sanity so so i leave him muttering the navel this doubloon here and 
they are all on fire to unscrew it but unscrew your navel and the consequence 
then again if it stays here that is ugly too for when nailed to the 
mast a sign that things grow desperate ha ha old ahab the white whale nail 
ye this is a pine tree my father in old tolland county cut down a 
pine tree once and found a silver ring grown over in it some old wedding 
ring how did it get there and so say in the resurrection when they come 
to fish up this old mast and find a doubloon lodged in it with bedded 
oysters for the shaggy bark oh the gold the precious precious gold the green hoard 
ye soon hish hish god goes the worlds blackberrying cook ho cook and cook us 
jenny hey hey hey hey hey jenny jenny and get your hoe cake done chapter 
100 leg and arm the pequod of nantucket meets the samuel enderby of london ahoy 
hast seen the white whale so cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english 
colours bearing down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man was standing in 
his hoisted quarter boat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain who was 
carelessly reclining in his own bow he was a darkly tanned burly good natured fine 
looking man of sixty or thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him 
in festoons of blue pilot cloth and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind 
him like the broidered arm of a surcoat seen the white whale you this and 
withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it he held up a white arm 
of sperm whale bone terminating in a wooden head like a mallet my boat cried 
ahab impetuously and tossing about the oars near by to lower in less than a 
minute without quitting his little craft he and his crew were dropped to the water 
and were soon alongside of the stranger but here a curious difficulty presented itself in 
the excitement of the moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg 
he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own 
and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to 
the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel 
at a warning now it is no very easy matter for those who are almost 
hourly used to it like clamber up a side from a boat on the open 
sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and 
then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so deprived of one leg 
and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention ahab now 
found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height 
he could hardly hope to attain it has before been hinted perhaps that every little 
untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably 
irritated or exasperated ahab and in the present instance all this was heightened by the 
sight of the two officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by the 
perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully ornamented 
man ropes for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one 
legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters but 
this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glance how 
affairs stood cried out see i see heaving there jump boys and swing over the 
cutting tackle as good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a 
day or two previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive curved 
blubber hook now clean and dry was still attached to the end this was quickly 
lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the 
curve of the hook it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or 
the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and 
at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling hand over 
hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle soon he was carefully swung 
inside the high bulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm 
frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahab putting out his ivory 
leg and crossing the ivory arm like two sword fish blades cried out in his 
walrus way aye hearty let us shake bones together arm and a leg arm that 
never can shrink see and a leg that never can run where thou see the 
white whale long ago white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towards the 
east and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a telescope 
i saw him on the line last season he took that arm off did he 
asked ahab now sliding down from the capstan and resting on the shoulder as he 
did so he was the cause of it at least and that leg too me 
the yarn said ahab was it was the first time in my life that i 
ever cruised on the line began the englishman was ignorant of the white whale at 
that time well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales 
and my boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too 
that went milling and milling round so that my crew could only trim dish by 
sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale presently up breaches from the bottom of 
the sea a bouncing great whale with a milky white head and hump all feet 
and wrinkles was he it was he cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspended breath 
harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin were my irons cried ahab on me a 
chance then said the englishman good humoredly this old great grandfather with the white head 
and hump runs all afoam into the pod and goes to snapping furiously at my 
fast line i see to part it free the fast old know him it was 
exactly continued the one armed commander do not know but in biting the line it 
got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we know it then so that 
when we afterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump 
instead of the other that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matters stood 
and what a noble great whale it noblest and biggest i ever saw sir in 
my resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in 
and thinking the hap hazard line would get loose or the tooth it was tangled 
to might draw for i have a devil of a crew for a pull on 
a whale line seeing all this i say i jumped into my first here by 
the way captain i was saying i jumped into boat which see was gunwale and 
gunwale with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old great grandfather have 
it but lord look you and souls alive next instant in a jiff i was 
blind as a eyes befogged and bedeadened with black tail looming straight up out of 
it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple no use sterning all then but 
as i was groping at midday with a blinding sun all crown jewels as i 
was groping i say after the second iron to toss it comes the tail like 
a lima tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and flukes 
first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was all chips we 
all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i seized hold of my harpoon pole 
sticking in him and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish but 
a combing sea dashed me off and at the same instant the fish taking one 
good dart forwards went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed second 
iron towing along near me caught me clapping his hand just below his shoulder caught 
me just here i say and bore me down to flames i was thinking when 
when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb ript its way along 
the along the whole length of my out nigh my wrist and up i floated 
that gentleman there will tell you the rest by the way bunger surgeon bunger my 
lad captain now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn the professional gentleman thus 
familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothing specific visible 
to denote his gentlemanly rank on board his face was an exceedingly round but sober 
one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers 
and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one 
hand and a pill box held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at 
the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains but at his introduction of him to 
ahab he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his bidding was a shocking 
bad wound began the whale surgeon taking my advice captain boomer here stood our old 
enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the one armed captain addressing ahab on 
boy our old sammy off to the northward to get out of the blazing hot 
weather there on the line but it was no did all i could sat up 
with him nights was very severe with him in the matter of very severe chimed 
in the patient himself then suddenly altering his voice hot rum toddies with me every 
night till he see to put on the bandages and sending me to bed half 
seas over about three in the morning oh ye stars he sat up with me 
indeed and was very severe in my diet oh a great watcher and very dietetically 
severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh out why ye you know a precious 
jolly rascal but heave ahead boy rather be killed by you than kept alive by 
any other man captain you must have ere this perceived respected the imperturbable godly looking 
bunger slightly bowing to apt to be facetious at times he spins us many clever 
things of that sort but i may as well passant as the french i is 
to say jack bunger late of the reverend a strict total abstinence man i never 
cried the captain never drinks it a sort of fits to him fresh water throws 
him into the hydrophobia but go on with the arm story i may as well 
said the surgeon coolly was about observing sir before captain facetious interruption that spite of 
my best and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worse and worse the truth was 
sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw more than two feet 
and several inches long i measured it with the lead line in short it grew 
black i knew what was threatened and off it came but i had no hand 
in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is against all at it with the 
is the work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had that 
club hammer there put to the end to knock some brains out with i suppose 
as he tried mine once he flies into diabolical passions sometimes do ye see this 
dent his hat and brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowl like cavity in 
his skull but which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever 
having been a the captain there will tell you how that came here he knows 
i said the captain his mother did he was born with it oh you solemn 
rogue bunger was there ever such another bunger in the watery world bunger when you 
die you ought to die in pickle you dog you should be preserved to future 
ages you rascal became of the white whale now cried ahab who thus far had 
been impatiently listening to this by play between the two englishmen cried the one armed 
captain yes well after he sounded we see him again for some time in fact 
as i before hinted i then know what whale it was that had served me 
such a trick till some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard 
about moby some call then i knew it was he thou cross his wake again 
could not fasten want to try to one limb enough what should i do without 
this other arm and thinking moby dick bite so much as he swallows then interrupted 
bunger him your left arm for bait to get the right do you know gravely 
and mathematically bowing to each captain in you know gentlemen that the digestive organs of 
the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence that it is quite impossible for 
him to completely digest even a arm and he knows it too so that what 
you take for the white malice is only his awkwardness for he never means to 
swallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints but sometimes he is 
like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine in ceylon that making believe 
swallow jack knives once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest 
and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more when i gave him an emetic 
and he heaved it up in small tacks see no possible way for him to 
digest that jack knife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system yes captain 
boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one 
arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why 
in that case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at 
you shortly all thank ye bunger said the english captain welcome to the arm he 
has since i help it and know him then but not to another one no 
more white whales for me lowered for him once and that has satisfied me there 
would be great glory in killing him i know that and there is a ship 
load of precious sperm in him but hark ye best let alone you think so 
captain at the ivory leg is but he will still be hunted for all that 
what is best let alone that accursed thing is not always what least allures all 
a magnet how long since thou him last which way heading my soul and curse 
the foul cried bunger stoopingly walking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing the 
thermometer at the boiling point pulse makes these planks beat a lancet from his pocket 
and drawing near to arm roared ahab dashing him against the the boat which way 
heading god cried the english captain to whom the question was put the matter he 
was heading east i think your captain crazy whispering fedallah but fedallah putting a finger 
on his lip slid over the bulwarks to take the steering oar and ahab swinging 
the cutting tackle towards him commanded the sailors to stand by to lower in a 
moment he was standing in the stern and the manilla men were springing to their 
oars in vain the english captain hailed him with back to the stranger ship and 
face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the 
pequod chapter 101 the decanter ere the english ship fades from sight be it set 
down here that she hailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderby 
merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of enderby sons a 
house which in my poor opinion comes not far behind the united royal houses of 
the tudors and bourbons in point of real historical interest how long prior to the 
year of our lord 1775 this great whaling house was in existence my numerous fish 
documents do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fitted out the first 
english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale though for some score of years 
previous ever since 1726 our valiant coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had 
in large fleets pursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not 
elsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to 
harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale and that for half a century they 
were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him in 1778 a 
fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge 
of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape horn and was the first among the nations 
to lower a whale boat of any sort in the great south sea the voyage 
was a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full 
of the precious sperm the example was soon followed by other ships english and american 
and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open but not 
content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself samuel and all his 
many their mother only under their immediate auspices and partly i think at their expense 
the british government was induced to send the sloop of war rattler on a whaling 
voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded by a naval post captain the rattler 
made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much does not appear 
but this is not all in 1819 the same house fitted out a discovery whale 
ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of 
japan that called the a noble experimental cruise and it was thus that the great 
japanese whaling ground first became generally known the syren in this famous voyage was commanded 
by a captain coffin a nantucketer all honor to the enderbies therefore whose house i 
think exists to the present day though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have 
slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world the ship named 
after him was worthy of the honor being a very fast sailer and a noble 
craft every way i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast and 
drank good flip down in the forecastle it was a fine gam we had and 
they were all soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death 
and that fine gam i very long after old ahab touched her planks with his 
ivory minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that ship and may my 
parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever lose sight of it 
flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped it at the rate 
of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for squally off there by 
patagonia and all and called to reef topsails we were so top heavy that we 
had to swing each other aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of 
our jackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling 
gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the masts did not go overboard 
and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had to pass the 
flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much 
diluted and pickled it to my taste the beef was but with body in it 
they said it was bull beef others that it was dromedary beef but i do 
not know for certain how that was they had dumplings too small but substantial symmetrically 
globular and indestructible dumplings i fancied that you could feel them and roll them about 
in you after they were swallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked 
their pitching out of you like billiard balls the that be helped besides it was 
an anti scorbutic in short the bread contained the only fresh fare they had but 
the forecastle was not very light and it was very easy to step over into 
a dark corner when you ate it but all in all taking her from truck 
to helm considering the dimensions of the boilers including his own live parchment boilers fore 
and aft i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship of good fare and 
plenty fine flip and strong crack fellows all and capital from boot heels to hat 
band but why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other english 
whalers i know all such famous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the 
bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and 
drinking and laughing i will tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whalers 
is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale 
research when it has seemed needed the english were preceded in the whale fishery by 
the hollanders zealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extant in the 
fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touching plenty to eat and 
drink for as a general thing the english merchant ship scrimps her crew but not 
so the english whaler hence in the english this thing of whaling good cheer is 
not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin 
which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated during my researches in 
the leviathanic histories i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling 
smell of it i knew must be about whalers the title was coopman wherefore i 
concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery 
as every whale ship must carry its cooper i was reinforced in this opinion by 
seeing that it was the production of one swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a 
very learned man professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa 
claus and st to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box 
of sperm candles for his same dr snodhead so soon as he spied the book 
assured me that did not mean cooper but merchant in short this ancient and learned 
low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland and among other subjects contained a 
very interesting account of its whale fishery and in this chapter it was headed or 
that i found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars 
of 180 sail of dutch whalemen from which list as translated by dr snodhead i 
transcribe the following 400 000 lbs of beef 60 000 lbs friesland pork 150 000 
lbs of stock fish 550 000 lbs of biscuit 72 000 lbs of soft bread 
2 800 firkins of butter 20 000 lbs texel leyden cheese 144 000 lbs cheese 
probably an inferior article 550 ankers of geneva 10 800 barrels of beer most statistical 
tables are parchingly dry in the reading not so in the present case however where 
the reader is flooded with whole pipes barrels quarts and gills of good gin and 
good cheer at the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all 
this beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me 
capable of a transcendental and platonic application and furthermore i compiled supplementary tables of my 
own touching the probable quantity of stock fish etc consumed by every low dutch harpooneer 
in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery in the first place the amount of 
butter and texel and leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their 
naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and 
especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas on the very coasts 
of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train 
oil the quantity of beer too is very large 10 800 barrels now as those 
polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate so that 
the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen including the short voyage to and 
from the spitzbergen sea did not much exceed three months say and reckoning 30 men 
to each of their fleet of 180 sail we have 5 400 low dutch seamen 
in all therefore i say we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for 
a twelve allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin now 
whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might fancy them to have 
been were the right sort of men to stand up in a head and take 
good aim at flying whales this would seem somewhat improbable yet they did aim at 
them and hit them too but this was very far north be it remembered where 
beer agrees well with the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would 
be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in his 
boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford but no more enough 
has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries 
ago were high livers and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an 
example for say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing 
better out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least and 
this empties the decanter chapter 102 a bower in the arsacides hitherto in descriptively treating 
of the sperm whale i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect 
or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features but to a large 
and thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still further 
and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his garters and casting loose the hooks 
and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones set him before you in 
his ultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeleton but how now ishmael how 
is it that you a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about 
the subterranean parts of the whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures 
on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a 
specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land a full grown whale on 
your deck for examination as a cook dishes a roast pig surely not a veritable 
witness have you hitherto been ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege 
of jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters ridge 
pole sleepers and under pinnings making up the frame work of leviathan and belike of 
the tallow vats dairy rooms butteries and cheeseries in his bowels i confess that since 
jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless 
i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship 
i belonged to a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck 
for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and 
for the heads of the lances think you i let that chance go without using 
my boat hatchet and jack knife and breaking the seal and reading all the contents 
of that young cub and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the 
leviathan in their gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted to 
my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides for being at 
tranque years ago when attached to the trading ship dey of algiers i was invited 
to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with the lord of tranque at his retired 
palm villa at pupella a sea side glen not very far distant from what our 
sailors called bamboo town his capital among many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo 
being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought together 
in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent chiefly carved 
woods of wonderful devices chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes and all these 
distributed among whatever natural wonders the wonder freighted tribute rendering waves had cast upon his 
shores chief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after an unusually long 
raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoa nut 
tree whose plumage like tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet when the vast body had 
at last been stripped of its fathom deep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry 
in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen where a 
grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it the ribs were hung with trophies the 
vertebræ were carved with arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests kept 
up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory 
spout while suspended from a bough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees 
like the hair hung sword that so affrighted damocles it was a wondrous sight the 
wood was green as mosses of the icy glen the trees stood high and haughty 
feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath was as a loom with a gorgeous 
carpet on it whereof the ground vine tendrils formed the warp and woof and the 
living flowers the figures all the trees with all their laden branches all the shrubs 
and ferns and grasses the message carrying air all these unceasingly were active through the 
lacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure 
oh busy weaver unseen weaver word flows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore 
all these ceaseless toilings speak weaver thy hand one single word with thee shuttle figures 
float from forth the loom the freshet rushing carpet for ever slides away the weaver 
god he weaves and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal 
voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and 
only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it 
for even so it is in all material factories the spoken words that are inaudible 
among the flying spindles those same words are plainly heard without the walls bursting from 
the opened casements thereby have villainies been detected ah mortal then be heedful for so 
in all this din of the great loom thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar 
now amid the green life restless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worshipped 
skeleton lay gigantic idler yet as the ever woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and 
hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over with 
the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton life folded death 
death trellised life the grim god wived with youthful life and begat him curly headed 
glories now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull 
an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued i 
marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu he laughed 
but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was 
genuine to and fro i paced before this the vines through the with a ball 
of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid its many winding shaded colonnades and arbours but 
soon my line was out and following it back i emerged from the opening where 
i entered i saw no living thing within naught was there but bones cutting me 
a green measuring rod i once more dived within the skeleton from their arrow slit 
in the skull the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib now 
they shouted thou measure this our god for us how long do ye make him 
then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning feet and inches they cracked 
each sconces with their yard great skull seizing that lucky chance i quickly concluded my 
own admeasurements these admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be it 
recorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i 
please because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to to test my accuracy there 
is a leviathanic museum they tell me in hull england one of the whaling ports 
of that country where they have some fine specimens of fin backs and other whales 
likewise i have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have 
what the proprietors call only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the 
united states moreover at a place in yorkshire england burton constable by name a certain 
sir clifford constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of 
moderate size by no means of the full grown magnitude of my friend king in 
both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged were originally claimed by 
their proprietors upon similar grounds king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir 
clifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sir whale has been 
articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawers you can open and shut 
him in all his bony out his ribs like a gigantic swing all day upon 
his lower jaw locks are to be put upon some of his trap doors and 
shutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at 
his side sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery 
in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum 
and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead the skeleton dimensions i shall now 
proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm where i had them 
tattooed as in my wild wanderings at that period there was no other secure way 
of preserving such valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wished the 
other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was 
then least what untattooed parts might did not trouble myself with the odd inches nor 
indeed should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale chapter 103 
measurement of the skeleton in the first place i wish to lay before you a 
particular plain statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we are briefly 
to exhibit such a statement may prove useful here according to a careful calculation i 
have made and which i partly base upon captain estimate of seventy tons for the 
largest sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my careful calculation i 
say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between eighty five and ninety feet in 
length and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference such a whale will 
weigh at least ninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would 
considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants 
think you not then that brains like yoked cattle should be put to this leviathan 
to make him at all budge to any imagination having already in various ways put 
before you his skull spout hole jaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts 
i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of 
his unobstructed bones but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of 
the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the most complicated part 
and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not 
fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm as we proceed otherwise 
you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to 
view in length the sperm skeleton at tranque measured seventy two feet so that when 
fully invested and extended in life he must have been ninety feet long for in 
the whale the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body 
of this seventy two feet his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving some 
fifty feet of plain back bone attached to this back bone for something less than 
a third of its length was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed 
his vitals to me this vast ivory ribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine extending 
far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled the hull of 
a great ship new laid upon the stocks when only some twenty of her naked 
bow ribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the time but a long 
disconnected timber the ribs were ten on a side the first to begin from the 
neck was nearly six feet long the second third and fourth were each successively longer 
till you came to the climax of the fifth or one of the middle ribs 
which measured eight feet and some inches from that part the remaining ribs diminished till 
the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches in general thickness they 
all bore a seemly correspondence to their length the middle ribs were the most arched 
in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges 
over small streams in considering these ribs i could not but be struck anew with 
the circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale is 
by no means the mould of his invested form the largest of the tranque ribs 
one of the middle ones occupied that part of the fish which in life is 
greatest in depth now the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale 
must have been at least sixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more 
than eight feet so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of 
the living magnitude of that part besides for some way where i now saw but 
a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk 
in flesh muscle blood and bowels still more for the ample fins i here saw 
but a few disordered joints and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless 
flukes an utter blank how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man 
to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead attenuated 
skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in the heart of quickest perils only 
when within the eddyings of his angry flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can 
the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out but the spine for that 
the best way we can consider it is with a crane to pile its bones 
high up on end no speedy enterprise but now done it looks much like pillar 
there are forty and odd vertebræ in all which in the skeleton are not locked 
together they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a gothic spire forming solid 
courses of heavy masonry the largest a middle one is in width something less than 
three feet and in depth more than four the smallest where the spine tapers away 
into the tail is only two inches in width and looks something like a white 
billiard ball i was told that there were still smaller ones but they had been 
lost by some little cannibal urchins the children who had stolen them to play marbles 
with thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things 
tapers off at last into simple play chapter 104 the fossil whale from his mighty 
bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate 
would you you could not compress him by good rights he should only be treated 
of in imperial folio not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail 
and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic involutions of 
his intestines where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in 
the subterranean orlop deck of a line of battle ship since i have undertaken to 
manhandle this leviathan it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not 
overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him out to the uttermost 
coil of his bowels having already described him in most of his present habitatory and 
anatomical peculiarities it now remains to magnify him in an archæological fossiliferous and antediluvian point 
of view applied to any other creature than the an ant or a portly terms 
might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case is 
altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the 
dictionary and here be it said that whenever it has been convenient to consult one 
in the course of these dissertations i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of 
johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous uncommon personal bulk more fitted him 
to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me one often 
hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject though it may seem but 
an ordinary one how then with me writing of this leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands 
into placard capitals give me a quill give me crater for an inkstand friends hold 
my arms for in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this leviathan they 
weary me and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to 
include the whole circle of the sciences and all the generations of whales and men 
and mastodons past present and to come with all the revolving panoramas of empire on 
earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding its suburbs such and so magnifying is 
the virtue of a large and liberal theme we expand to its bulk to produce 
a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can 
ever be written on the flea though many there be who have tried it ere 
entering upon the subject of fossil whales i present my credentials as a geologist by 
stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been a stone mason and also a 
great digger of ditches canals and wells wine vaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts 
likewise by way of preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the 
earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct the 
subsequent relics discovered in what are called the tertiary formations seem the connecting or at 
any rate intercepted links between the antichronical creatures and those whose remote posterity are said 
to have entered the ark all the fossil whales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary 
period which is the last preceding the superficial formations and though none of them precisely 
answer to any known species of the present time they are yet sufficiently akin to 
them in general respects to justify their taking rank as cetacean fossils detached broken fossils 
of pre adamite whales fragments of their bones and skeletons have within thirty years past 
at various intervals been found at the base of the alps in lombardy in france 
in england in scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama among the 
more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the year 1779 
was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street opening almost directly upon 
the palace of the tuileries and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp 
in time cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic species 
but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast 
skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year 1842 on the plantation of judge 
creagh in alabama the awe stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the 
bones of one of the fallen angels the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile 
and bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bones of it being 
taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned out that this alleged 
reptile was a whale though of a departed species a significant illustration of the fact 
again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but 
little clue to the shape of his fully invested body so owen rechristened the monster 
zeuglodon and in his paper read before the london geological society pronounced it in substance 
one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out 
of existence when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusks jaws ribs and 
vertebræ all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea monsters but at 
the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical leviathans 
their incalculable seniors i am by a flood borne back to that wondrous period ere 
time itself can be said to have begun for time began with man here grey 
chaos rolls over me and i obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities when 
wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics and in all 
the 25 000 miles of this circumference not an inhabitable breadth of land was visible 
then the whole world was the and king of creation he left his wake along 
the present lines of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree like 
leviathan harpoon had shed older blood than the methuselah seems a school boy i look 
round to shake hands with shem i am horror struck at this antemosaic unsourced existence 
of the unspeakable terrors of the whale which having been before all time must needs 
exist after all humane ages are over but not alone has this leviathan left his 
pre adamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed 
his ancient bust but upon egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claim for them an 
almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable print of his fin in an apartment of 
the great temple of denderah some fifty years ago there was discovered upon the granite 
ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffins and dolphins similar to the 
grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns gliding among them old leviathan swam 
as of yore was there swimming in that planisphere centuries before solomon was cradled nor 
must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale in his 
own osseous post diluvian reality as set down by the venerable john leo the old 
barbary traveller far from the sea side they have a temple the rafters and beams 
of which are made of whale bones for whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes 
cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine that by a secret power 
bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can pass it without immediate death but 
the truth of the matter is that on either side of the temple there are 
rocks that shoot two miles into the sea and wound the whales when they light 
upon they keep a rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon 
the ground with its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of which cannot 
be reached by a man upon a back this rib says john leo is said 
to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it their historians affirm that 
a prophet who of mahomet came from this temple and some do not stand to 
assert that the prophet jonas was cast forth by the whale at the base of 
the temple in this afric temple of the whale i leave you reader and if 
you be a nantucketer and a whaleman you will silently worship there chapter 105 does 
the magnitude diminish he perish inasmuch then as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us 
from the head waters of the eternities it may be fitly inquired whether in the 
long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his 
sires but upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the present 
day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system 
embracing a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whales found in that 
tertiary system those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier 
ones of all the pre adamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the 
alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than seventy feet in 
length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen that the tape measure gives seventy 
two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale and i have heard 
on authority that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the 
time of capture but may it not be that while the whales of the present 
hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods may it 
not be that since time they have degenerated assuredly we must conclude so if we 
are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as pliny and the ancient naturalists generally 
for pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk and aldrovandus of 
others which measured eight hundred feet in walks and thames tunnels of whales and even 
in the days of banks and solander naturalists we find a danish member of the 
academy of sciences setting down certain iceland whales reydan siskur or wrinkled bellies at one 
hundred and twenty yards that is three hundred and sixty feet and lacépède the french 
naturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page 
3 sets down the right whale at one hundred metres three hundred and twenty eight 
feet and this work was published so late as a d 1825 but will any 
whaleman believe these stories no the whale of to day is as big as his 
ancestors in time and if ever i go where pliny is i a whaleman more 
than he was will make bold to tell him so because i cannot understand how 
it is that while the egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even 
pliny was born do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian 
in his socks and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest egyptian 
and nineveh tablets by the relative proportions in which they are drawn just as plainly 
prove that the high bred stall fed prize cattle of smithfield not only equal but 
far exceed in magnitude the fattest of fat kine in the face of all this 
i will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated but 
still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketers whether owing to 
the almost omniscient look outs at the mast heads of the whale ships now penetrating 
even through straits and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world and 
the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts the moot point is whether 
leviathan can long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he 
must not at last be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like the 
last man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final puff comparing 
the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo which not forty years 
ago overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of illinois and missouri and shook their 
iron manes and scowled with their thunder clotted brows upon the sites of populous river 
capitals where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch in 
such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the hunted whale 
cannot now escape speedy extinction but you must look at this matter in every light 
though so short a period a good census of the buffalo in illinois exceeded the 
census of men now in london and though at the present day not one horn 
or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the cause of this 
wondrous extermination was the spear of man yet the far different nature of the whale 
hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan forty men in one ship 
hunting the sperm whales for forty eight months think they have done extremely well and 
thank god if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in 
the days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west when 
the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness and a virgin 
the same number of moccasined men for the same number of months mounted on horse 
instead of sailing in ships would have slain not forty but forty thousand and more 
buffaloes a fact that if need were could be statistically stated nor considered aright does 
it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale for 
example that in former years the latter part of the last century say these leviathans 
in small pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyages 
were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative because as has been elsewhere 
noticed those whales influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense 
caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and pods and schools 
of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfrequent armies that is 
all and equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the so called whale bone whales 
no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them hence that species also 
is declining for they are only being driven from promontory to cape and if one 
coast is no longer enlivened with their jets then be sure some other and remoter 
strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle furthermore concerning these last mentioned 
leviathans they have two firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain 
impregnable and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty swiss have retreated to 
their mountains so hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas the whale 
bone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate 
glassy barriers and walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a 
charmed circle of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man but as perhaps 
fifty of these whale bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot some philosophers of the 
forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions but 
though for some time past a number of these whales not less than 13 000 
have been annually slain on the west coast by the americans alone yet there are 
considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument 
in this matter natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of 
the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say to harto the 
historian of goa when he tells us that at one hunting the king of siam 
took 4 000 elephants that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle 
in the temperate climes and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants 
which have now been hunted for thousands of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal 
and by all the successive monarchs of the they still survive there in great numbers 
much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he has a pasture to 
expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as all asia both americas europe and 
africa new holland and all the isles of the sea combined moreover we are to 
consider that from the presumed great longevity of whales their probably attaining the age of 
a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generations 
must be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea of by 
imagining all the grave yards cemeteries and family vaults of creation yielding up the live 
bodies of all the men women and children who were alive seventy five years ago 
and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe wherefore for 
all these things we account the whale immortal in his species however perishable in his 
individuality he swam the seas before the continents broke water he once swam over the 
site of the tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in flood he despised ark 
and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the netherlands to kill 
off its rats then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost 
crest of the equatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the skies chapter 106 leg 
the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel enderby of london had 
not been unattended with some small violence to his own person he had lighted with 
such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a 
half splintering shock and when after gaining his own deck and his own pivot hole 
there he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it was 
as ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough then the already shaken ivory received 
such an additional twist and wrench that though it still remained entire and to all 
appearances lusty yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy and indeed it seemed small 
matter for wonder that for all his pervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give 
careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for 
it had not been very long prior to the sailing from nantucket that he had 
been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible by some unknown and 
seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had 
stake wise smitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extreme difficulty 
that the agonizing wound was entirely cured nor at the time had it failed to 
enter his monomaniac mind that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but 
the direct issue of a former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that 
as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the 
sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable events do naturally 
beget their like yea more than equally thought ahab since both the ancestry and posterity 
of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint 
of this that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings that while some natural 
enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world but on 
the contrary shall be followed by the joy childlessness of all despair whereas some guilty 
mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond 
the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequality in 
the deeper analysis of the thing for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicities 
ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a 
mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracings out 
not belie the obvious deduction to trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries carries 
us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face 
of all the glad hay making suns and soft cymballing round harvest moons we must 
needs give in to this that the gods themselves are not for ever glad the 
ineffaceable sad birth mark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow 
in the signers unwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might more properly 
in set way have been disclosed before with many other particulars concerning ahab always had 
it remained a mystery to some why it was that for a certain period both 
before and after the sailing of the pequod he had hidden himself away with such 
grand lama like exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as it were 
among the marble senate of the dead captain bruited reason for this thing appeared by 
no means adequate though indeed as touching all deeper part every revelation partook more of 
significant darkness than of explanatory light but in the end it all came out this 
one matter did at least that direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary 
recluseness and not only this but to that ever contracting dropping circle ashore who for 
any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid 
circle the above hinted as it did moodily unaccounted for by itself with terrors not 
entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails so that through their zeal 
for him they had all conspired so far as in them lay to muffle up 
the knowledge of this thing from others and hence it was that not till a 
considerable interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the decks but be all this as 
it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive princes and 
potentates of fire have to do or not with earthly ahab yet in this present 
matter of his leg he took plain practical procedures called the carpenter and when that 
functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay set about making a new leg 
and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of 
jaw ivory sperm whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order 
that a careful selection of the stoutest clearest grained stuff might be secured this done 
the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night and to provide all 
the fittings for it independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use moreover 
the forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold 
and to accelerate the affair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the 
forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed chapter 107 the carpenter seat thyself sultanically 
among the moons of saturn and take high abstracted man alone and he seems a 
wonder a grandeur and a woe but from the same point take mankind in mass 
and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and 
hereditary but most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of the 
high humane abstraction the carpenter was no duplicate hence he now comes in person on 
this stage like all sea going ship carpenters and more especially those belonging to whaling 
vessels he was to a certain off handed practical extent alike experienced in numerous trades 
and callings collateral to his own the pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of 
all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an 
auxiliary material but besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter 
of the pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in 
a large ship upon a three or four voyage in uncivilized and far distant seas 
for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties stove boats sprung spars reforming 
the shape of clumsy bladed oars inserting eyes in the deck or new tree nails 
in the side planks and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business 
he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes both useful and capricious 
the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold was his 
vice bench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices of different sizes and 
both of iron and of wood at all times except when whales were alongside this 
bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the try works a belaying pin 
is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole the carpenter claps it 
into one of his ever ready vices and straightway files it smaller a lost land 
bird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a captive out of clean 
shaved rods of right whale bone and cross beams of sperm whale ivory the carpenter 
makes a pagoda looking cage for it an oarsman sprains his wrist the carpenter concocts 
a soothing lotion stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of 
his every oar screwing each oar in his big vice of wood the carpenter symmetrically 
supplies the constellation a sailor takes a fancy to wear shark bone ear rings the 
carpenter drills his ears another has the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping one 
hand upon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably winces 
under the unconcluded operation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs 
him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth 
thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent and without respect in 
all teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he deemed but top blocks men themselves 
he lightly held for capstans but while now upon so wide a field thus variously 
accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to 
argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing was this man 
more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were impersonal i say for 
it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things that it seemed one with 
the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active in uncounted 
modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you though you dig foundations for cathedrals 
yet was this half horrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an all 
ramifying heartlessness was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutch like antediluvian wheezing 
humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have 
served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of ark 
was it that this old carpenter had been a life long wanderer whose much rolling 
to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed 
off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him he was a stript 
abstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised as a new born babe living without premeditated reference to 
this world or the next you might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him 
involved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seem to 
work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored 
to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by 
a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he was a pure manipulator his 
brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscles 
of his fingers he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum 
in parvo sheffield contrivances assuming the a little a common pocket knife but containing not 
only blades of various sizes but also screw drivers cork screws tweezers awls pens rulers 
nail filers countersinkers so if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw 
driver all they had to do was to open that part of him and the 
screw was fast or if for tweezers take him up by the legs and there 
they were yet as previously hinted this omnitooled open and shut carpenter was after all 
no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a common soul in 
him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty what that was 
whether essence of quicksilver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling but 
there it was and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more 
and this it was this same unaccountable cunning life principle in him this it was 
that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning 
wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a sentry box and this 
soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake chapter 108 
ahab and the carpenter the night watch carpenter standing before his vice bench and by 
the light of two lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg which joist 
is firmly fixed in the vice slabs of ivory leather straps pads screws and various 
tools of all sorts lying about the bench forward the red flame of the forge 
is seen where the blacksmith is at work drat the file and drat the bone 
that is hard which should be soft and that is soft which should be hard 
so we go who file old jaws and shinbones try another aye now this works 
better sneezes halloa this bone dust is sneezes sneezes sneezes my soul it let me 
speak this is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber saw 
a live tree and you get this dust amputate a live bone and you get 
it sneezes come come you old smut there bear a hand and have that ferule 
and buckle screw be ready for them presently lucky now sneezes no knee joint to 
make that might puzzle a little but a mere easy as making hop poles only 
i should like to put a good finish on time time if i but only 
had the time i could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever 
sneezes scraped to a lady in a parlor those buckskin legs and calves of legs 
seen in shop windows compare at all they soak water they do and of course 
get rheumatic and have to be doctored sneezes with washes and lotions just like live 
legs there before i saw it off now i must call his old mogulship and 
see whether the length will be all right too short if anything i guess ha 
the heel we are in luck here he comes or somebody else certain ahab advancing 
during the ensuing scene the carpenter continues sneezing at times well manmaker just in time 
sir if the captain pleases i will now mark the length let me measure sir 
measured for a leg good well not the first time about it there keep thy 
finger on it this is a cogent vice thou hast here carpenter let me feel 
its grip once so so it does pinch some oh sir it will break beware 
no fear i like a good grip i like to feel something in this slippery 
world that can hold man prometheus about there blacksmith i he about he must be 
forging the buckle screw sir now right a partnership he supplies the muscle part he 
makes a fierce red flame there aye sir he must have the white heat for 
this kind of fine work um m so he must i do deem it now 
a most meaning thing that that old greek prometheus who made men they say should 
have been a blacksmith and animated them with fire for made in fire must properly 
belong to fire and so probable how the soot flies this must be the remainder 
the greek made the africans of carpenter when through with that buckle tell him to 
forge a pair of steel shoulder blades a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack sir 
hold while prometheus is about it order a complete man after a desirable pattern imprimis 
fifty feet high in his socks then chest modelled after the thames tunnel then legs 
with roots to to stay in one place then arms three feet through the wrist 
no heart at all brass forehead and about a quarter of an acre of fine 
brains and let me i order eyes to see outwards no but put a sky 
light on top of his head to illuminate inwards there take the order and away 
now he speaking about and he speaking to i should like to know shall i 
keep standing here aside but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome one no no 
no i must have a lantern ho ho it hey here are two sir one 
will serve my turn what art thou thrusting that thief catcher into my face for 
man thrusted light is worse than presented pistols i thought sir that you spoke to 
carpenter carpenter why no very tidy and i may say an extremely gentlemanlike sort of 
business thou art in here carpenter thou rather work in clay sir clay sir mud 
we leave clay to ditchers sir the impious what art thou sneezing about bone is 
rather dusty sir take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself 
under living noses sir ah guess so dear look ye carpenter i dare say thou 
callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman eh well then will it speak thoroughly well 
for thy work if when i come to mount this leg thou makest i shall 
nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that is carpenter my 
old lost leg the flesh and blood one i mean canst thou not drive that 
old adam away truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now yes i have heard 
something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the 
feeling of his old spar but it will be still pricking him at times may 
i humbly ask if it be really so sir it is man look put thy 
live leg here in the place where mine once was so now here is only 
one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul where thou feelest tingling 
life there exactly there there to a hair do i a riddle i should humbly 
call it a poser sir hist then how dost thou know that some entire living 
thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest aye 
and standing there in thy spite in thy most solitary hours then dost thou not 
fear eavesdroppers hold speak and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg 
though it be now so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the 
fiery pains of hell for ever and without a body hah good lord truly sir 
if it comes to that i must calculate over again i think i carry a 
small figure sir look ye pudding heads should never grant premises long before the leg 
is done perhaps an hour sir bungle away at it then and bring it to 
me turns to go oh life here i am proud as greek god and yet 
standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on cursed be that mortal 
inter indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers i would be free as air 
and down in the whole books i am so rich i could have given bid 
for bid with the wealthiest prætorians at the auction of the roman empire which was 
the and yet i owe for the flesh in the tongue i brag with by 
heavens get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to one small compendious 
vertebra so carpenter resuming his work well well well stubb knows him best of all 
and stubb always says queer says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer queer 
says stubb queer and keeps dinning it into mr starbuck all the queer very queer 
and his leg yes now that i think of it his bedfellow has a stick 
of jaw bone for a wife and this is his leg stand on this what 
was that now about one leg standing in three places and all three places standing 
in one was that oh i wonder he looked so scornful at me a sort 
of strange thoughted sometimes they say but only haphazard like then a short little old 
body like me should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall heron 
built captains the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick and a great cry 
for life boats and the leg long and slim sure enough now for most folks 
one pair of legs lasts a lifetime and that must be because they use them 
mercifully as a tender hearted old lady uses her roly poly old coach horses but 
ahab oh a hard driver look driven one leg to death and spavined the other 
for life and now wears out bone legs by the cord halloa there you smut 
bear a hand there with those screws and finish it before the resurrection fellow comes 
a calling with his horn for all legs true or false as brewery men go 
round collecting old beer barrels to fill up again what a leg this is it 
looks like a real live leg filed down to nothing but the core be standing 
on this to morrow be taking altitudes on it halloa i almost forgot the little 
oval slate smoothed ivory where he figures up the latitude so so chisel file and 
sand paper now chapter 109 ahab and starbuck in the cabin according to usage they 
were pumping the ship next morning and lo no inconsiderable oil came up with the 
water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak much concern was shown and 
starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair in sperm whalemen with 
any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semi weekly duty to 
conduct a hose into the hold and drench the casks with sea water which afterwards 
at varying intervals is removed by the pumps hereby the casks are sought to be 
kept damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the mariners readily 
detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo now from the south and west the 
pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isles between which lies one of 
the tropical outlets from the china waters into the pacific and so starbuck found ahab 
with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one 
representing the long eastern coasts of the japanese matsmai and sikoke with his snow white 
new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long 
pruning hook of a jack knife in his hand the wondrous old man with his 
back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old courses again 
there hearing the footstep at the door but not turning round to it deck begone 
ahab mistakes it is i the oil in the hold is leaking sir we must 
up burtons and break out burtons and break out now that we are nearing japan 
heave to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops do that 
sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a 
year what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving sir it is 
so it is if we get it was speaking of the oil in the hold 
sir i was not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak 
all aleak myself aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks but those 
leaky casks are in a leaky ship and a far worse plight than the man 
yet i stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deep 
loaded hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this howling gale 
starbuck not have the burtons hoisted will the owners say sir the owners stand on 
nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons what cares ahab owners owners thou art always prating 
to me starbuck about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience but 
look ye the only real owner of anything is its commander and hark ye my 
conscience is in this keel deck ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the 
cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only 
every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself but within also seemed 
more than half distrustful of itself better man than i might well pass over in 
thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man aye and in a 
happier captain ahab dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me 
deck sir not yet i do entreat and i do dare be forbearing shall we 
not understand each other better than hitherto captain ahab ahab seized a loaded musket from 
the rack forming part of most south sea cabin furniture and pointing it towards starbuck 
exclaimed is one god that is lord over the earth and one captain that is 
lord over the pequod deck for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate 
and his fiery cheeks you would have almost thought that he had really received the 
blaze of the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and as 
he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said hast outraged not insulted me 
sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck thou wouldst but 
laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man waxes brave but 
nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that murmured ahab as starbuck disappeared that he beware of 
something there then unconsciously using the musket for a staff with an iron brow he 
paced to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plaits of his 
forehead relaxed and returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck art 
but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate then raising his 
voice to the crew the sails and close reef the top sails fore and aft 
back the main yard up burton and break out in the main hold it were 
perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that as respecting starbuck ahab thus acted 
it may have been a flash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which 
under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient in the 
important chief officer of his ship however it was his orders were executed and the 
burtons were hoisted chapter 110 queequeg in his coffin upon searching it was found that 
the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound and that the leak must 
be further off so it being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing 
the slumbers of the huge ground tier butts and from that black midnight sending those 
gigantic moles into the daylight above so deep did they go and so ancient and 
corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons that you almost looked next for 
some mouldy corner stone cask containing coins of captain noah with copies of the posted 
placards vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after tierce too of 
water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and iron bundles of hoops were 
hoisted out till at last the piled decks were hard to get about and the 
hollow hull echoed under foot as if you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled 
and rolled in the sea like an air freighted demijohn top heavy was the ship 
as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head well was it that the 
typhoons did not visit them then now at this time it was that my poor 
pagan companion and fast bosom friend queequeg was seized with a fever which brought him 
nigh to his endless end be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures 
are unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain 
the higher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who as harpooneer 
must not only face all the rage of the living whale we have elsewhere his 
dead back in a rolling sea and finally descend into the gloom of the hold 
and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and 
see to their stowage to be short among whalemen the harpooneers are the holders so 
called poor queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you should have stooped over 
the hatchway and peered down upon him there where stripped to his woollen drawers the 
tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard 
at the bottom of a well and a well or an ice house it somehow 
proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his 
sweatings he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after 
some suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill of the door 
of death how he wasted and wasted away in those few long lingering days till 
there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing but as all 
else in him thinned and his cheek bones grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing 
fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply 
looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health 
in him which could not die or be weakened and like circles on the water 
which as they grow fainter expand so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding like the 
rings of eternity an awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you 
sat by the side of this waning savage and saw as strange things in his 
face as any beheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died for whatever is truly wondrous 
and fearful in man never yet was put into words or books and the drawing 
near of death which alike levels all alike impresses all with a last revelation which 
only an author from the dead could adequately tell so us say it dying chaldee 
or greek had higher and holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping 
over the face of poor queequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock and 
the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest and the invisible flood 
tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven not a man of the 
crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himself what he thought of his 
case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked he called one to him 
in the grey morning watch when the day was just breaking and taking his hand 
said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark 
wood like the rich war wood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had 
learned that all whalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes 
and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it was 
not unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior stretched 
him out in his canoe and so left him to be floated away to the 
starry archipelagoes for not only do they believe that the stars are isles but that 
far beyond all visible horizons their own mild uncontinented seas interflow with the blue heavens 
and so form the white breakers of the milky way he added that he shuddered 
at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual sea custom 
tossed like something vile to the death devouring sharks no he desired a canoe like 
those of nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a 
whale boat these coffin canoes were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering 
and much lee way adown the dim ages now when this strange circumstance was made 
known aft the carpenter was at once commanded to do bidding whatever it might include 
there was some heathenish coffin coloured old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage 
had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the lackaday islands and from these dark 
planks the coffin was recommended to be made no sooner was the carpenter apprised of 
the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his 
character proceeded into the forecastle and took measure with great accuracy regularly chalking person as 
he shifted the rule poor fellow have to die now ejaculated the long island sailor 
going to his vice bench the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference now transferringly 
measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be and then made the 
transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities this done he marshalled the planks 
and his tools and to work when the last nail was driven and the lid 
duly planed and fitted he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it inquiring 
whether they were ready for it yet in that direction overhearing the indignant but half 
humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg 
to every consternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him nor was 
there any denying him seeing that of all mortals some dying men are the most 
tyrannical and certainly since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor 
fellows ought to be indulged leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin 
with an attentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock drawn 
from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one 
of the paddles of his boat all by his own request also biscuits were then 
ranged round the sides within a flask of fresh water was placed at the head 
and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot 
and a piece of sail cloth being rolled up for a pillow queequeg now entreated 
to be lifted into his final bed that he might make trial of its comforts 
if any it had he lay without moving a few minutes then told one to 
go to his bag and bring out his little god yojo then crossing his arms 
on his breast with yojo between he called for the coffin lid hatch he called 
it to be placed over him the head part turned over with a leather hinge 
and there lay queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view 
it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced 
in his hammock but ere this was done pip who had been slily hovering near 
by all this while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sobbings 
took him by the hand in the other holding his tambourine rover will ye never 
have done with all this weary roving where go ye now but if the currents 
carry ye to those sweet antilles where the beaches are only beat with water lilies 
will ye do one little errand for me seek out one pip now been missing 
long i think in those far antilles if ye find him then comfort him for 
he must be very sad for look left his tambourine behind found it rig a 
dig dig dig now queequeg die and beat ye your dying march have heard murmured 
starbuck gazing down the scuttle in violent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient 
tongues and that when the mystery is probed it turns out always that in their 
wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some 
lofty scholars so to my fond faith poor pip in this strange sweetness of his 
lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes where learned he that but there 
he speaks again but more wildly now two and two make a general of him 
ho his harpoon lay it across here a dig dig dig huzza oh for a 
game cock now to sit upon his head and crow queequeg dies game ye that 
queequeg dies game ye good heed of that queequeg dies game i say game game 
game but base little pip he died a coward died all upon pip hark ye 
if ye find pip tell all the antilles a runaway a coward a coward a 
coward tell them he jumped from a whale boat never beat my tambourine over base 
pip and hail him general if he were once more dying here no no shame 
upon all upon them let go drown like pip that jumped from a whale boat 
shame shame during all this queequeg lay with closed eyes as if in a dream 
pip was led away and the sick man was replaced in his hammock but now 
that he had apparently made every preparation for death now that his coffin was proved 
a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soon there seemed no need of the box and 
thereupon when some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the cause of 
his sudden convalescence was this a critical moment he had just recalled a little duty 
ashore which he was leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying he 
could not die yet he averred they asked him then whether to live or die 
was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a 
word it was conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere 
sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent 
ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and 
civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing generally speaking a 
sick savage is almost half well again in a day so in good time my 
queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent 
days but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out 
his arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then 
springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit 
for a fight with a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a sea 
chest and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there 
many spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures 
and drawings and it seemed that hereby he was striving in his rude way to 
copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body and this tattooing had been the 
work of a departed prophet and seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks 
had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth 
and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in his 
own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but 
whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own live heart beat against them 
and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living 
parchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thought 
it must have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his when one 
morning turning away from surveying poor devilish tantalization of the gods chapter 111 the pacific 
when gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great south sea 
were it not for other things i could have greeted my dear pacific with uncounted 
thanks for now the long supplication of my youth was answered that serene ocean rolled 
eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue there is one knows not what sweet 
mystery about this sea whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul 
beneath like those fabled undulations of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st john 
and meet it is that over these sea pastures wide rolling watery prairies and fields 
of all four continents the waves should rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly 
for here millions of mixed shades and shadows drowned dreams somnambulisms reveries all that we 
call lives and souls lie dreaming dreaming still tossing like slumberers in their beds the 
ever rolling waves but made so by their restlessness to any meditative magian rover this 
serene pacific once beheld must ever after be the sea of his adoption it rolls 
the midmost waters of the world the indian ocean and atlantic being but its arms 
the same waves wash the moles of the new built californian towns but yesterday planted 
by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of 
asiatic lands older than abraham while all between float milky ways of coral isles and 
low lying endless unknown archipelagoes and impenetrable japans thus this mysterious divine pacific zones the 
whole bulk about makes all coasts one bay to it seems the tide beating heart 
of earth lifted by those eternal swells you needs must own the seductive god bowing 
your head to pan but few thoughts of pan stirred brain as standing like an 
iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one nostril he unthinkingly 
snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must 
be walking and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found 
sea that sea in which the hated white whale must even then be swimming launched 
at length upon these almost final waters and gliding towards the japanese cruising ground the 
old purpose intensified itself his firm lips met like the lips of a vice the 
delta of his veins swelled like overladen brooks in his very sleep his ringing cry 
ran through the vaulted hull all the white whale spouts thick blood chapter 112 the 
blacksmith availing himself of the mild summer cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes 
and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated perth the begrimed 
blistered old blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold again after concluding 
his contributory work for leg but still retained it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts 
by the foremast being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen and harpooneers and bowsmen 
to do some little job for them altering or repairing or new shaping their various 
weapons and boat furniture often he would be surrounded by an eager circle all waiting 
to be served holding boat spades pike heads harpoons and lances and jealously watching his 
every sooty movement as he toiled nevertheless this old was a patient hammer wielded by 
a patient arm no murmur no impatience no petulance did come from him silent slow 
and solemn bowing over still further his chronically broken back he toiled away as if 
toil were life itself and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of 
his heart and so it was miserable a peculiar walk in this old man a 
certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait had at an early period of 
the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners and to the importunity of their persisted 
questionings he had finally given in and so it came to pass that every one 
now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate belated and not innocently one bitter 
midnight on the road running between two country towns the blacksmith half stupidly felt the 
deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in a leaning dilapidated barn the issue 
was the loss of the extremities of both feet out of this revelation part by 
part at last came out the four acts of the gladness and the one long 
and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his drama he was an 
old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedly encountered that thing in 
technicals called ruin he had been an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to 
do owned a house and garden embraced a youthful daughter like loving wife and three 
blithe ruddy children every sunday went to a cheerful looking church planted in a grove 
but one night under cover of darkness and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement 
a desperate burglar slid into his happy home and robbed them all of everything and 
darker yet to tell the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his heart 
it was the bottle conjuror upon the opening of that fatal cork forth flew the 
fiend and shrivelled up his home now for prudent most wise and economic reasons the 
shop was in the basement of his dwelling but with a separate entrance to it 
so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness 
but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of her young armed old hammer whose 
reverberations muffled by passing through the floors and walls came up to her not unsweetly 
in her nursery and so to stout iron lullaby the infants were rocked to slumber 
oh woe on woe oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst thou 
taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him then had 
the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphans a truly venerable legendary sire 
to dream of in their after years and all of them a care killing competency 
but death plucked down some virtuous elder brother on whose whistling daily toil solely hung 
the responsibilities of some other family and left the worse than useless old man standing 
till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest why tell the 
whole the blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between and 
each blow every day grew fainter than the last the wife sat frozen at the 
window with tearless eyes glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children the bellows 
fell the forge choked up with cinders the house was sold the mother dived down 
into the long church yard grass her children twice followed her thither and the houseless 
familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape his every woe unreverenced his grey 
head a scorn to flaxen curls death seems the only desirable sequel for a career 
like this but death is only a launching into the region of the strange untried 
it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense remote the wild 
the watery the unshored therefore to the death longing eyes of such men who still 
have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide does the all contributed and all 
receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable taking terrors and wonderful new 
life adventures and from the hearts of infinite pacifics the thousand mermaids sing to hither 
broken hearted here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death here are wonders 
supernatural without dying for them come hither bury thyself in a life which to your 
now equally abhorred and abhorring landed world is more oblivious than death come hither put 
up thy gravestone too within the churchyard and come hither till we marry thee hearkening 
to these voices east and west by early sunrise and by fall of eve the 
soul responded aye i come and so perth went a whaling chapter 113 the forge 
with matted beard and swathed in a bristling shark skin apron about mid day perth 
was standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an iron wood log 
with one hand holding a pike head in the coals and with the other at 
his lungs when captain ahab came along carrying in his hand a small rusty looking 
leathern bag while yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at 
last perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the red mass 
sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights some of which flew close to ahab 
these thy mother chickens perth they are always flying in thy wake birds of good 
omen too but not to all here they burn but among them without a scorch 
i am scorched all over captain ahab answered perth resting for a moment on his 
hammer am past scorching not easily thou scorch a scar well no more thy shrunk 
voice sounds too calmly sanely woeful to me in no paradise myself i am impatient 
of all misery in others that is not mad thou go mad blacksmith say why 
dost thou not go mad how thou endure without being mad do the heavens yet 
hate thee that thou not go mad wert thou making there an old pike head 
sir there were seams and dents in it thou make it all smooth again blacksmith 
after such hard usage as it had think so sir i suppose thou smoothe almost 
any seams and dents never mind how hard the metal blacksmith sir i think i 
can all seams and dents but one ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and 
leaning with both hands on shoulders ye here ye smoothe out a seam like this 
blacksmith sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow thou blacksmith glad enough would i lay 
my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes answer thou 
smoothe this seam that is the one sir said i not all seams and dents 
but one blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for though thou 
only it here in my flesh it has worked down into the bone of my 
that is all wrinkles but away with play no more gaffs and pikes to day 
look ye here jingling the leathern bag as if it were full of gold coins 
too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part 
perth something that will stick in a whale like his own fin bone the stuff 
flinging the pouch upon the anvil ye blacksmith these are the gathered nail stubbs of 
the steel shoes of racing horses shoe stubbs sir why captain ahab thou hast here 
then the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work know it old man these 
stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers quick forge me 
the harpoon and forge me first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist 
and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow line quick 
blow the fire when at last the twelve rods were made ahab tried them one 
by one by spiralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt 
flaw rejecting the last one that over again perth this done perth was about to 
begin welding the twelve into one when ahab stayed his hand and said he would 
weld his own iron as then with regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil 
perth passing to him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressed 
forge shooting up its intense straight flame the parsee passed silently and bowing over his 
head towards the fire seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil but 
as ahab looked up he slid aside that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for 
muttered stubb looking on from the forecastle parsee smells fire like a fusee and smells 
of it himself like a hot powder pan at last the shank in one complete 
rod received its final heat and as perth to temper it plunged it all hissing 
into the cask of water near by the scalding steam shot up into bent face 
thou brand me perth wincing for a moment with the pain i been but forging 
my own branding iron then god not that yet i fear something captain ahab is 
not this harpoon for the white whale the white fiend but now for the barbs 
thou must make them thyself man here are my best of steel here and make 
the barbs sharp as the needle sleet of the icy sea for a moment the 
old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them them man 
i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup nor pray work 
fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the shank the 
steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmith was about giving 
the barbs their final heat prior to tempering them he cried to ahab to place 
the water cask near water for that i want it of the true death temper 
ahoy there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagans will ye give me as much 
blood as will cover this barb holding it high up a cluster of dark nods 
replied yes three punctures were made in the heathen flesh and the white barbs were 
then tempered non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli deliriously howled ahab 
as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood now mustering the spare poles from 
below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it ahab fitted the 
end to the socket of the iron a coil of new tow line was then 
unwound and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great 
tension pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harp string then 
eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed and now for the seizings 
at one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns were all braided 
and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole was then driven hard up 
into the socket from the lower end the rope was traced half way along the 
length and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine this done pole iron and the 
three inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory 
leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank but 
ere he entered his cabin light unnatural half bantering yet most piteous sound was heard 
oh pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange mummeries not 
unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it chapter 114 
the gilder penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising ground the 
pequod was soon all astir in the fishery often in mild pleasant weather for twelve 
fifteen eighteen and twenty hours on the stretch they were engaged in the boats steadily 
pulling or sailing or paddling after the whales or for an interlude of sixty or 
seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising though with but small success for their pains at 
such times under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow heaving swells seated 
in his boat light as a birch canoe and so sociably mixing with the soft 
waves themselves that like hearth stone cats they purr against the gunwale these are the 
times of dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the skin one 
forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it and would not willingly remember that this 
velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang these are the times when in his whale 
boat the rover softly feels a certain filial confident land like feeling towards the sea 
that he regards it as so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealing only 
the tops of her masts seems struggling forward not through high rolling waves but through 
the tall grass of a rolling prairie as when the western horses only show their 
erected ears while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure the long drawn 
virgin vales the mild blue hill sides as over these there steals the hush the 
hum you almost swear that play wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes in some 
glad may time when the flowers of the woods are plucked and all this mixes 
with your most mystic mood so that fact and fancy half way meeting interpenetrate and 
form one seamless whole nor did such soothing scenes however temporary fail of at least 
as temporary an effect on ahab but if these secret golden keys did seem to 
open in him his own secret golden treasuries yet did his breath upon them prove 
but tarnishing oh grassy glades oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul in ye 
long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life ye men yet may roll 
like young horses in new morning clover and for some few fleeting moments feel the 
cool dew of the life immortal on them would to god these blessed calms would 
last but the mingled mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof calms 
crossed by storms a storm for every calm there is no steady unretracing progress in 
this life we do not advance through fixed gradations and at the last one pause 
unconscious spell thoughtless faith doubt the common doom then scepticism then disbelief resting at last 
in pondering repose of if but once gone through we trace the round again and 
are infants boys and men and ifs eternally where lies the final harbor whence we 
unmoor no more in what rapt ether sails the world of which the weariest will 
never weary where is the father hidden our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded 
mothers die in bearing them the secret of our paternity lies in their grave and 
we must there to learn it and that same day too gazing far down from 
his side into that same golden sea starbuck lowly murmured unfathomable as ever lover saw 
in his young eye me not of thy teeth tiered sharks and thy kidnapping cannibal 
ways let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory i look deep down and do 
believe and stubb fish like with sparkling scales leaped up in that same golden light 
am stubb and stubb has his history but here stubb takes oaths that he has 
always been jolly chapter 115 the pequod meets the bachelor and jolly enough were the 
sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind some few weeks after 
harpoon had been welded it was a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged 
in her last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now in 
glad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vain gloriously sailing round among the widely separated 
ships on the ground previous to pointing her prow for home the three men at 
her mast head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats from the 
stern a whale boat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was 
seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain signals ensigns and 
jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in 
each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which in her 
top mast cross trees you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid and nailed 
to her main truck was a brazen lamp as was afterwards learned the bachelor had 
met with the most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in 
the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish 
not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for 
the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for from the 
ships she had met and these were stowed along the deck and in the and 
state rooms even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling wood and the 
cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil butt lashed down to the 
floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their 
chests and filled them it was humorously added that the cook had clapped a head 
on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffee 
pot and filled it that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and 
filled them that indeed everything was filled with sperm except the pantaloons pockets and those 
he reserved to thrust his hands into in self complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction 
as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the barbarian 
sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of 
her men were seen standing round her huge try pots which covered with the parchment 
like poke or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to 
every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew on the quarter deck the mates 
and harpooneers were dancing with the olive hued girls who had eloped with them from 
the polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast 
and mainmast three long island negroes with glittering fiddle bows of whale ivory were presiding 
over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the company were tumultuously busy at the masonry 
of the try works from which the huge pots had been removed you would have 
almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cries they raised as 
the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea lord and master 
over all this scene the captain stood erect on the elevated quarter deck so that 
the whole rejoicing drama was full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own 
individual diversion and ahab he too was standing on his quarter deck shaggy and black 
with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each all jubilations for things 
passed the other all forebodings as to things to two captains in themselves impersonated the 
whole striking contrast of the scene aboard come aboard cried the gay commander lifting a 
glass and a bottle in the air seen the white whale gritted ahab in reply 
only heard of him but believe in him at all said the other good humoredly 
aboard art too damned jolly sail on hast lost any men enough to speak islanders 
all come aboard old hearty come along soon take that black from your brow come 
along will ye the play a full ship and homeward bound wondrous familiar is a 
fool muttered ahab then aloud art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well 
then call me an empty ship and outward bound so go thy ways and i 
will mine forward there set all sail and keep her to the wind and thus 
while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stubbornly fought against it 
and so the two vessels parted the crew of the pequod looking with grave lingering 
glances towards the receding bachelor but the men never heeding their gaze for the lively 
revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the homeward bound 
craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from 
the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together for that vial 
was filled with nantucket soundings chapter 116 the dying whale not seldom in this life 
when on the right side favourites sail close by us we though all adroop before 
catch somewhat of the rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out so 
seemed it with the pequod for next day after encountering the gay bachelor whales were 
seen and four were slain and one of them by ahab it was far down 
the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done and floating 
in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and whale both stilly died together then 
such a sweetness and such plaintiveness such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air 
that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of 
the manilla isles the spanish land breeze wantonly turned sailor had gone to sea freighted 
with these vesper hymns soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom ahab who had 
sterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil 
boat for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales turning sunwards of the head 
and so strange spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahab conveyed a 
wondrousness unknown before turns and turns him to it slowly but how steadfastly his homage 
rendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions he too worships fire most faithful 
broad baronial vassal of the sun that these too favouring eyes should see these too 
favouring sights look here far water locked beyond all hum of human weal or woe 
in these most candid and impartial seas where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets where 
for long chinese ages the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to as 
stars that shine upon the unknown source here too life dies sunwards full of faith 
but see no sooner dead than death whirls round the corpse and it heads some 
other way thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hast builded thy 
separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas thou art an infidel thou 
queen and too truly speakest to me in the wide slaughtering typhoon and the hushed 
burial of its after calm nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head 
and then gone round again without a lesson to me trebly hooped and welded hip 
of power oh high aspiring rainbowed jet one strivest this one jettest all in vain 
in vain oh whale dost thou seek intercedings with yon all quickening sun that only 
calls forth life but gives it not again yet dost thou darker half rock me 
with a prouder if a darker faith all thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here 
i am buoyed by breaths of once living things exhaled as air but water now 
hail for ever hail o sea in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his 
only rest born of earth yet suckled by the sea though hill and valley mothered 
me ye billows are my foster brothers chapter 117 the whale watch the four whales 
slain that evening had died wide apart one far to windward one less distant to 
leeward one ahead one astern these last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the 
windward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it 
lay by its side all night and that boat was the waif pole was thrust 
upright into the dead spout hole and the lantern hanging from its top cast a 
troubled flickering glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves 
which gently chafed the broad flank like soft surf upon a beach ahab and all 
his crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the 
sharks that spectrally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their 
tails a sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of gomorrah 
ran shuddering through the air started from his slumbers ahab face to face saw the 
parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men 
in a flooded world have dreamed it again said he the hearses have i not 
said old man that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine who are hearsed that 
die on the sea i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this 
voyage two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not 
made by mortal hands and the visible wood of the last one must be grown 
in america aye a strange sight that parsee hearse and its plumes floating over the 
ocean with the waves for the pall bearers ha such a sight we shall not 
soon see it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man 
what was that saying about thyself it come to the last i shall still go 
before thee thy pilot when thou art so gone that ever ere i can follow 
thou must still appear to me to pilot me still it not so well then 
did i believe all ye say oh my pilot i have here two pledges that 
i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it another pledge old man said the 
parsee as his eyes lighted up like fire flies in the only can kill thee 
gallows ye mean am immortal then on land and on sea cried ahab with a 
laugh of derision on land and on sea both were silent again as one man 
the grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the bottom and ere 
noon the dead whale was brought to the ship chapter 118 the quadrant the season 
for the line at length drew near and every day when ahab coming from his 
cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes and the 
eager mariners quickly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyes 
centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the prow for 
the equator in good time the order came it was hard upon high noon and 
ahab seated in the bows of his high hoisted boat was about taking his wonted 
daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude now in that japanese sea the 
days in summer are as freshets of effulgences that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the 
blazing focus of the glassy immeasurable burning glass the sky looks lacquered clouds there are 
none the horizon floats and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors 
of throne well that quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses through which to take sight 
of that solar fire so swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship 
and with his astrological looking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture 
for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise 
meridian meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the parsee was kneeling beneath him on 
the deck and with face thrown up like was eyeing the same sun with him 
only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and his wild face was 
subdued to an earthly passionlessness at length the desired observation was taken and with his 
pencil upon his ivory leg ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that 
precise instant then falling into a revery he again looked up towards the sun and 
murmured to himself sea mark thou high and mighty pilot thou tellest me truly where 
i am canst thou cast the least hint where i shall be or canst thou 
tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living where is moby dick 
this instant thou must be eyeing him these eyes of mine look into the very 
eye that is even now beholding him aye and into the eye that is even 
now equally beholding the objects on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun then 
gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other its numerous cabalistical contrivances he 
pondered again and muttered toy plaything of haughty admirals and commodores and captains the world 
brags of thee of thy cunning and might but what after all canst thou do 
but tell the poor pitiful point where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide 
planet and the hand that holds thee no not one jot more thou canst not 
tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to morrow 
noon and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun science curse thee thou vain 
toy and cursed be all the things that cast eyes aloft to that heaven whose 
live vividness but scorches him as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy 
light o sun level by nature to this horizon are the glances of eyes not 
shot from the crown of his head as if god had meant him to gaze 
on his firmament curse thee thou quadrant dashing it to the deck longer will i 
guide my earthly way by thee the level compass and the level dead reckoning by 
log and by line these shall conduct me and show me my place on the 
sea aye lighting from the boat to the deck i trample on thee thou paltry 
thing that feebly pointest on high thus i split and destroy thee as the frantic 
old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet a sneering 
triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for passed 
over the mute motionless face unobserved he rose and glided away while awestruck by the 
aspect of their commander the seamen clustered together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pacing 
the deck shouted the braces up helm in in an instant the yards swung round 
and as the ship half wheeled upon her heel her three firm seated graceful masts 
erectly poised upon her long ribbed hull seemed as the three horatii pirouetting on one 
sufficient steed standing between the knight heads starbuck watched the tumultuous way and also as 
he went lurching along the deck have sat before the dense coal fire and watched 
it all aglow full of its tormented flaming life and i have seen it wane 
at last down down to dumbest dust old man of oceans of all this fiery 
life of thine what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes cried 
stubb sea coal ye that mr coal not your common charcoal well well i heard 
ahab mutter some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine swears that 
i must play them and no others and damn me ahab but thou actest right 
live in the game and die in it chapter 119 the candles warmest climes but 
nurse the cruellest fangs the tiger of bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure 
skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders gorgeous cuba knows tornadoes that never 
swept tame northern lands so too it is that in these resplendent japanese seas the 
mariner encounters the direst of all storms the typhoon it will sometimes burst from out 
that cloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town towards evening 
of that day the pequod was torn of her canvas and bare poled was left 
to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly ahead when darkness came on sky 
and sea roared and split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed 
the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of 
the tempest had left for its after sport holding by a shroud starbuck was standing 
on the quarter deck at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what 
additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there while stubb and flask were directing 
the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats but all their 
pains seemed naught though lifted to the very top of the cranes the windward quarter 
boat did not escape a great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling high 
teetering side stove in the bottom at the stern and left it again all dripping 
through like a sieve work bad work mr starbuck said stubb regarding the wreck the 
sea will have its way stubb for one fight it you see mr starbuck a 
wave has such a great long start before it leaps all round the world it 
runs and then comes the spring but as for me all the start i have 
to meet it is just across the deck here but never mind all in fun 
so the old song says sings oh jolly is the gale and a joker is 
the whale his tail such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is 
the ocean oh the scud all a his flip only when he stirs in the 
such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the ocean oh thunder 
splits the ships but he only smacks his lips a of this flip such a 
funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the ocean oh stubb cried starbuck 
the typhoon sing and strike his harp here in our rigging but if thou art 
a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace i am not a brave man never 
said i was a brave man i am a coward and i sing to keep 
up my spirits and i tell you what it is mr starbuck no way to 
stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat and when done ten 
to one i sing ye the doxology for a wind up look through my eyes 
if thou hast none of thine own how can you see better of a dark 
night than anybody else never mind how foolish cried starbuck seizing stubb by the shoulder 
and pointing his hand towards the weather bow thou not that the gale comes from 
the eastward the very course ahab is to run for moby dick the very course 
he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove 
in the stern sheets man where he is wont to stand point is stove man 
now jump overboard and sing away if thou must half understand ye in the wind 
yes round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to nantucket soliloquized starbuck 
suddenly heedless of question gale that now hammers at us to stave us we can 
turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home yonder to windward 
all is blackness of doom but to leeward see it lightens up there but not 
with the lightning at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness following 
the flashes a voice was heard at his side and almost at the same instant 
a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead there thunder said ahab groping his way along 
the bulwarks to his pivot hole but suddenly finding his path made plain to him 
by elbowed lances of fire now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore 
is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod 
which at sea some ships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into 
the water but as this conductor must descend to considerable depth that its end may 
avoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if kept constantly towing there it 
would be liable to many mishaps besides interfering not a little with some of the 
rigging and more or less impeding the way in the water because of all this 
the lower parts of a lightning rods are not always overboard but are generally made 
in long slender links so as to be the more readily hauled up into the 
chains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may require rods the rods 
cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had 
just been darting flambeaux to light ahab to his post they overboard drop them over 
fore and aft quick cried ahab have fair play here though we be the weaker 
side yet contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and andes that all the world 
may be secured but out on privileges let them be sir aloft cried starbuck corpusants 
the corpusants all the yard arms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at 
each tri pointed lightning rod end with three tapering white flames each of the three 
tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like three gigantic wax tapers before 
an altar the boat let it go cried stubb at this instant as a swashing 
sea heaved up under his own little craft so that its gunwale violently jammed his 
hand as he was passing a lashing it slipping backward on the deck his uplifted 
eyes caught the flames and immediately shifting his tone he corpusants have mercy on us 
all to sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the trance of the 
calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curses from the topsail 
yard arms when most they teeter over to a seething sea but in all my 
voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when burning finger has been laid on 
the ship when his mene tekel has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage 
while this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard from the enchanted crew who 
in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle all their eyes gleaming in that pale 
phosphorescence like a far away constellation of stars relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic 
jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud 
from which the thunder had come the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his shark white 
teeth which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit 
up by the preternatural light tattooing burned like satanic blue flames on his body the 
tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more the pequod and 
every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall a moment or two passed 
when starbuck going forward pushed against some one it was stubb thinkest thou now man 
i heard thy cry it was not the same in the song no it i 
said the corpusants have mercy on us all and i hope they will still but 
do they only have mercy on long faces they no bowels for a laugh and 
look ye mr too dark to look hear me then i take that mast head 
flame we saw for a sign of good luck for those masts are rooted in 
a hold that is going to be chock block with sperm oil see and so 
all that sperm will work up into the masts like sap in a tree yes 
our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti the good promise we saw at 
that moment starbuck caught sight of face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight glancing upwards 
he cried see and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed 
redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor corpusants have mercy on us all cried stubb again at 
the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame the parsee was 
kneeling in front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from 
the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a 
number of the seamen arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like 
a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig in various enchanted attitudes like 
the standing or stepping or running skeletons in herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck 
but all their eyes upcast aye men cried ahab up at it mark it well 
the white flame but lights the way to the white whale hand me those mainmast 
links there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood 
against fire so then last link held fast in his left hand he put his 
foot upon the parsee and with fixed upward eye and high flung right arm he 
stood erect before the lofty tri pointed trinity of flames thou clear spirit of clear 
fire whom on these seas i as persian once did worship till in the sacramental 
act so burned by thee that to this hour i bear the scar i now 
know thee thou clear spirit and i now know that thy right worship is defiance 
to neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind and for hate thou canst but 
kill and all are killed no fearless fool now fronts thee i own thy speechless 
placeless power but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional 
unintegral mastery in me in the midst of the personified impersonal a personality stands here 
though but a point at best i came i go yet while i earthly live 
the queenly personality lives in me and feels her royal rights but war is pain 
and hate is woe come in thy lowest form of love and i will kneel 
and kiss thee but at thy highest come as mere supernal power and though thou 
launchest navies of full freighted worlds that in here that still remains indifferent oh thou 
clear spirit of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire 
i breathe it back to thee sudden repeated flashes of lightning the nine flames leap 
lengthwise to thrice their previous height ahab with the rest closes his eyes his right 
hand pressed hard upon them own thy speechless placeless power said i not so nor 
was it wrung from me nor do i now drop these links thou canst blind 
but i can then grope thou canst consume but i can then be ashes take 
the homage of these poor eyes and shutter hands i would not take it the 
lightning flashes through my skull mine eye balls ache and ache my whole beaten brain 
seems as beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground oh oh yet blindfold yet will 
i talk to thee light though thou be thou leapest out of darkness but i 
am darkness leaping out of light leaping out of thee the javelins cease open eyes 
see or not there burn the flames oh thou magnanimous now i do glory in 
my genealogy but thou art but my fiery father my sweet mother i know not 
oh cruel what hast thou done with her there lies my puzzle but thine is 
greater thou knowest not how came ye hence callest thyself unbegotten certainly knowest not thy 
beginning hence callest thyself unbegun i know that of me which thou knowest not of 
thyself oh thou omnipotent there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee thou clear spirit to 
whom all thy eternity is but time all thy creativeness mechanical through thee thy flaming 
self my scorched eyes do dimly see it oh thou foundling fire thou hermit immemorial 
thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle thy unparticipated grief here again with haughty agony i 
read my sire leap leap up and lick the sky i leap with thee i 
burn with thee would fain be welded with thee defyingly i worship thee boat the 
boat cried starbuck at thy boat old man harpoon the one forged at fire remained 
firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whale bow but 
the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop 
off and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale 
forked fire as the silent harpoon burned there like a tongue starbuck grasped ahab by 
the god is against thee old man forbear an ill voyage ill begun ill continued 
let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fair wind 
of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this overhearing starbuck the panic 
stricken crew instantly ran to the not a sail was left aloft for the moment 
all the aghast thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry but dashing the 
rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon ahab waved it like 
a torch among them swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast 
loose a end petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart 
that he held the men fell back in dismay and ahab again spoke your oaths 
to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine and heart soul and body 
lungs and life old ahab is bound and that ye may know to what tune 
this heart beats look ye here thus i blow out the last fear and with 
one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame as in the hurricane that sweeps 
the plain men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and 
strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a 
mark for thunderbolts so at those last words of many of the mariners did run 
from him in a terror of dismay chapter 120 the deck towards the end of 
the first night watch ahab standing by the helm starbuck approaching him must send down 
the main top sail yard sir the band is working loose and the lee lift 
is half stranded shall i strike it sir nothing lash it if i had sky 
sail poles sway them up now name anchors are working sir shall i get them 
inboard nothing and stir nothing but lash everything the wind rises but it has not 
got up to my table lands yet quick and see to it masts and keels 
he takes me for the hunch backed skipper of some coasting smack send down my 
main top sail yard ho gluepots loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds and this 
brain truck of mine now sails amid the cloud scud shall i strike that oh 
none but cowards send down their brain trucks in tempest time what a hooroosh aloft 
there i would take it for sublime did i not know that the colic is 
a noisy malady oh take medicine take medicine chapter 121 midnight forecastle bulwarks stubb and 
flask mounted on them and passing additional lashings over the anchors there hanging stubb you 
may pound that knot there as much as you please but you will never pound 
into me what you were just now saying and how long ago is it since 
you said the very contrary you once say that whatever ship ahab sails in that 
ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy just as though it were loaded 
with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward stop now you say so suppose 
i did what then part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind 
besides supposing we are loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward how the devil 
could the lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here why my little man you 
have pretty red hair but you get afire now shake yourself aquarius or the water 
bearer flask might fill pitchers at your coat collar you see then that for these 
extra risks the marine insurance companies have extra guarantees here are hydrants flask but hark 
again and answer ye the other thing first take your leg off from the crown 
of the anchor here though so i can pass the rope now listen the mighty 
difference between holding a lightning rod in the storm and standing close by a mast 
that got any lightning rod at all in a storm you see you timber head 
that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is 
first struck what are you talking about then not one ship in a hundred carries 
rods and ahab man and all of us in no more danger then in my 
poor opinion than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas why 
you king post you i suppose you would have every man in the world go 
about with a small lightning rod running up the corner of his hat like a 
militia skewered feather and trailing behind like his sash why ye be sensible flask easy 
to be sensible why ye then any man with half an eye can be sensible 
know that stubb you sometimes find it rather hard when a soaked through hard to 
be sensible a fact and i am about drenched with this spray never mind catch 
the turn there and pass it seems to me we are lashing down these anchors 
now as if they were never going to be used again tying these two anchors 
here flask seems like tying a hands behind him and what big generous hands they 
are to be sure these are your iron fists hey what a hold they have 
too i wonder flask whether the world is anchored anywhere if she is she swings 
with an uncommon long cable though there hammer that knot down and done so next 
to touching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory i say just wring out 
my jacket skirts will ye thank ye they laugh at long togs so flask but 
seems to me a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms 
afloat the tails tapering down that way serve to carry off the water see same 
with cocked hats the cocks form gable end eave troughs flask no more monkey jackets 
and tarpaulins for me i must mount a swallow tail and drive down a beaver 
so halloa whew there goes my tarpaulin overboard lord lord that the winds that come 
from heaven should be so unmannerly this is a nasty night lad chapter 122 midnight 
aloft and lightning the main top sail yard tashtego passing new lashings around it um 
um stop that thunder plenty too much thunder up here the use of thunder um 
um um we want thunder we want rum give us a glass of rum um 
um um chapter 123 the musket during the most violent shocks of the typhoon the 
man at the jaw bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck 
by its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached to they were some 
play to the tiller was indispensable in a severe gale like this while the ship 
is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast it is by no means uncommon to 
see the needles in the compasses at intervals go round and round it was thus 
with the at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling 
velocity with which they revolved upon the cards it is a sight that hardly anyone 
can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion some hours after midnight the typhoon abated 
so much that through the strenuous exertions of starbuck and engaged forward and the other 
shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main top sails were cut adrift from 
the spars and went eddying away to leeward like the feathers of an albatross which 
sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm tossed bird is on the wing 
the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a storm trysail was 
set further aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision 
again and the the present east south he was to steer if practicable was once 
more given to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale he had only 
steered according to its vicissitudes but as he was now bringing the ship as near 
her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed 
coming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair instantly the yards were squared to 
the lively song of ho the fair wind oh ye ho cheerly men the crew 
singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil 
portents preceding it in compliance with the standing order of his report immediately and at 
any one of the twenty four hours any decided change in the affairs of the 
deck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the reluctantly and gloomily he mechanically went 
below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance ere knocking at his state room he 
involuntarily paused before it a moment the cabin long swings this way and burning fitfully 
and casting fitful shadows upon the old bolted door thin one with fixed blinds inserted 
in place of upper panels the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming 
silence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of the 
elements the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as they stood upright against 
the forward bulkhead starbuck was an honest upright man but out of heart at that 
instant when he saw the muskets there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent 
with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for 
itself would have shot me once he murmured the very musket that he pointed at 
me one with the studded stock let me touch it strange that i who have 
handled so many deadly lances strange that i should shake so now loaded i must 
see aye aye and powder in the pan not good best spill it cure myself 
of this hold the musket boldly while i think come to report a fair wind 
to him but how fair fair for death and doom fair for moby dick a 
fair wind only fair for that accursed fish very tube he pointed at me very 
one this hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i 
handle now and he would fain kill all his crew does he not say he 
will not strike his spars to any gale has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant 
and in these same perilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning 
of the error abounding log and in this very typhoon did he not swear that 
he would have no lightning rods but shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered 
to drag a whole company down to doom with him it would make him the 
wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm 
and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if ahab have his 
way if then he were this aside that crime would not be his ha is 
he muttering in his sleep yes just there there sleeping sleeping aye but still alive 
and soon awake again i withstand thee then old man not reasoning not remonstrance not 
entreaty wilt thou hearken to all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat 
commands this is all thou breathest aye and the men have thy vow all of 
us are ahabs great god forbid is there no other way no lawful way him 
a prisoner to be taken home what hope to wrest this old living power from 
his own living hands only a fool would try it say he were pinioned even 
knotted all over with ropes and hawsers chained down to ring bolts on this cabin 
floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then i could not endure 
the sight could not possibly fly his howlings all comfort sleep itself inestimable reason would 
leave me on the long intolerable voyage what then remains the land is hundreds of 
leagues away and locked japan the nearest i stand alone here upon an open sea 
with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law aye so heaven a 
murderer when its lightning strikes a would be murderer in his bed tindering sheets and 
skin together would i be a murderer then slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he 
placed the loaded end against the door this level hammock swings within his head this 
way a touch and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again mary 
mary boy boy if i wake thee not to death old man who can tell 
to what unsounded deeps body this day week may sink with all the crew great 
god where art thou shall i shall i wind has gone down and shifted sir 
the fore and main topsails are reefed and set she heads her course all oh 
moby dick i clutch thy heart at last such were the sounds that now came 
hurtling from out the old tormented sleep as if voice had caused the long dumb 
dream to speak the yet levelled musket shook like a arm against the panel starbuck 
seemed wrestling with an angel but turning from the door he placed the death tube 
in its rack and left the place too sound asleep mr stubb go thou down 
and wake him and tell him i must see to the deck here thou what 
to say chapter 124 the needle next morning the not yet subsided sea rolled in 
long slow billows of mighty bulk and striving in the gurgling track pushed her on 
like palms outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky and air seemed vast 
outbellying sails the whole world boomed before the wind muffled in the full morning light 
the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his 
bayonet rays moved on in stacks emblazonings as of crowned babylonian kings and queens reigned 
over everything the sea was as a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leaps with 
light and heat long maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time the 
tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright rays produced 
ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the 
rearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake ha 
my ship thou mightest well be taken now for the sea chariot of the sun 
ho ho all ye nations before my prow i bring the sun to ye yoke 
on the further billows hallo a tandem i drive the sea but suddenly reined back 
by some counter thought he hurried towards the helm huskily demanding how the ship was 
heading sou east sir said the frightened steersman liest smiting him with his clenched fist 
east at this hour in the morning and the sun astern upon this every soul 
was confounded for the phenomenon just then observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one 
else but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause thrusting his head half 
way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly 
fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and 
lo the two compasses pointed east and the pequod was as infallibly going west but 
ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man 
with a rigid laugh exclaimed have it it has happened before mr starbuck last thunder 
turned our all thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it 
but never before has it happened to me sir said the pale mate gloomily here 
it must needs be said that accidents like this have in more than one case 
occurred to ships in violent storms the magnetic energy as developed in the needle is 
as all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not 
to be much marvelled at that such things should be instances where the lightning has 
actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging 
the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal all its loadstone 
virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than 
an old knitting needle but in either case the needle never again of itself recovers 
the original virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be affected the 
same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were the 
lowermost one inserted into the kelson deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed 
compasses the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took the precise 
bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted shouted out his 
orders for the course to be changed accordingly the yards were hard up and once 
more the pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fair 
one had only been juggling her meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbuck said 
nothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and in some small degree 
seemed then to be sharing his unmurmuringly acquiesced as for the men though some of 
them lowly rumbled their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate but 
as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was 
only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible for a space 
the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries but chancing to slip with his 
ivory heel he saw the crushed copper sight tubes of the quadrant he had the 
day before dashed to the deck poor proud heaven gazer and pilot yesterday i wrecked 
thee and to day the compasses would fain have wrecked me so so but ahab 
is lord over the level loadstone yet mr lance without a pole a top maul 
and the smallest of the sail needles quick accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the 
thing he was now about to do were certain prudential motives whose object might have 
been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill 
in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the old man 
well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily practicable was not a thing 
to be passed over by superstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portents said he 
steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed him the things he had demanded 
men the thunder turned old needles but out of this bit of steel ahab can 
make one of his own that will point as true as any abashed glances of 
servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors as this was said and with fascinated eyes 
they awaited whatever magic might follow but starbuck looked away with a blow from the 
top maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to 
the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without its touching 
the deck then with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron 
rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly 
hammered that several times the mate still holding the rod as before then going through 
some small strange motions with indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended 
to augment the awe of the crew is called for linen thread and moving to 
the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally suspended the sail needle 
by its middle over one of the compass cards at first the steel went round 
and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its 
place when ahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from 
the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimed ye for yourselves if ahab 
be not lord of the level loadstone the sun is east and that compass swears 
it one after another they peered in for nothing but their own eyes could persuade 
such ignorance as theirs and one after another they slunk away in his fiery eyes 
of scorn and triumph you then saw ahab in all his fatal pride chapter 125 
the log and line while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this 
voyage the log and line had but very seldom been in use owing to a 
confident reliance upon other means of determining the place some merchantmen and many whalemen especially 
when cruising wholly neglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequently 
more for sake than anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course 
steered by the ship as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour 
it had been thus with the pequod the wooden reel and angular log attached hung 
long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks rains and spray had damped 
it sun and wind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a 
thing that hung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as 
he happened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene and 
he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his frantic oath about the 
level log and line the ship was sailing plungingly astern the billows rolled in riots 
there heave the log two seamen came the golden hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman 
the reel one of ye heave they went towards the extreme stern on the lee 
side where the deck with the oblique energy of the wind was now almost dipping 
into the creamy sidelong rushing sea the manxman took the reel and holding it high 
up by the projecting handle ends of the spindle round which the spool of line 
revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahab advanced to him ahab 
stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a 
preliminary hand coil to toss overboard when the old manxman who was intently eyeing both 
him and the line made bold to speak i mistrust it this line looks far 
gone long heat and wet have spoiled it hold old gentleman long heat and wet 
have they spoiled thee thou to hold or truer perhaps life holds thee not thou 
it hold the spool sir but just as my captain says with these grey hairs 
of mine not worth while disputing with a superior confess that there a patched professor 
in queen granite founded college but methinks too subservient where wert thou born the little 
rocky isle of man sir hit the world by that know not sir but i 
was born there the isle of man hey well the other way good a man 
from man a man born in once independent man and now unmanned of man which 
is sucked what up with the reel the dead blind wall butts all inquiring heads 
at last up with it so the log was heaved the loose coils rapidly straightened 
out in a long dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl 
in turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towing resistance of the 
log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely hard snap the overstrained line sagged down 
in one long festoon the tugging log was gone crush the quadrant the thunder turns 
the needles and now the mad sea parts the log line but ahab can mend 
all haul in here tahitian reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make 
another log and mend thou the line see to it he goes now to him 
happened but to me the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world 
haul in haul in tahitian these lines run whole and whirling out come in broken 
and dragging slow ha pip come to help eh pip whom call ye pip pip 
jumped from the whale boat missing see now if ye fished him up here fisherman 
it drags hard i guess holding on jerk him tahiti jerk him off we haul 
in no cowards here ho his arm just breaking water a hatchet a hatchet cut 
it haul in no cowards here captain ahab sir sir pip trying to get on 
board again thou crazy loon cried the manxman seizing him by the arm from the 
quarter deck greater idiot ever scolds the lesser muttered ahab advancing off from that holiness 
where sayest thou pip was boy there sir astern lo lo who art thou boy 
i see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes oh god that 
man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through who art thou boy 
boy sir crier ding dong ding pip pip pip one hundred pounds of clay reward

did beget this luckless child and have abandoned him ye creative libertines here boy cabin 
shall be home henceforth while ahab lives thou touchest my inmost centre boy thou art 
tied to me by cords woven of my heart strings come down this velvet shark 
skin intently gazing at hand and feeling it now had poor pip but felt so 
kind a thing as this perhaps he had been lost this seems to me sir 
as a man rope something that weak souls may hold by oh sir let old 
perth now come and rivet these two hands together the black one with the white 
for i will not let this go boy nor will i thee unless i should 
thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here come then to my cabin lo

omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not what he 
does yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude come i feel prouder 
leading thee by thy black hand than though i grasped an go two daft ones 
now muttered the old manxman daft with strength the other daft with weakness but the 
end of the rotten dripping too mend it eh i think we had best have 
a new line altogether see mr stubb about it chapter 126 the life buoy steering 
now south eastward by levelled steel and her progress solely determined by level log and 
line the pequod held on her path towards the equator making so long a passage 
through such unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade 
winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous 
and desperate scene at last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it 
were of the equatorial fishing ground and in the deep darkness that goes before the 
dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the headed by startled by a 
cry so plaintively wild and half articulated wailings of the ghosts of all murdered one 
and all they started from their reveries and for the space of some moments stood 
or sat or leaned all transfixedly listening like the carved roman slave while that wild 
cry remained within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was 
mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled yet the grey oldest mariner of 
that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men 
in the sea below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey 
dawn when he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask 
not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder those 
rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals and 
some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams that had lost their 
cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her crying and sobbing 
with their human sort of wail but this only the more affected some of them 
because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arising not only from their 
peculiar tones when in distress but also from the human look of their round heads 
and semi intelligent faces seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside in the sea under 
certain circumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for men but the bodings of 
the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one 
of their number that morning at sun rise this man went from his hammock to 
his mast head at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet 
half waked from his sleep for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether 
it was thus with the man there is now no telling but be that as 
it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry was cry 
and a looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and looking down 
a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea the life 
long slender dropped from the stern where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring 
but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this 
cask it had shrunken so that it slowly filled and that parched wood also filled 
at its every pore and the studded iron bound cask followed the sailor to the 
bottom as if to yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one 
and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out 
for the white whale on the white own peculiar ground that man was swallowed up 
in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the time indeed in some 
sort they were not grieved at this event at least as a portent for they 
regarded it not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future but as the fulfilment 
of an evil already presaged they declared that now they knew the reason of those 
wild shrieks they had heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay 
the lost life buoy was now to be replaced starbuck was directed to see to 
it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as in the 
feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage all hands were impatient 
of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end whatever that might 
prove to be therefore they were going to leave the stern unprovided with a buoy 
when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin life 
buoy of a coffin cried starbuck starting queer that i should say said stubb will 
make a good enough one said flask carpenter here can arrange it easily it up 
nothing else for it said starbuck after a melancholy pause it carpenter do not look 
at me coffin i mean dost thou hear me rig it shall i nail down 
the lid sir moving his hand as with a hammer shall i caulk the seams 
sir moving his hand as with a caulking iron shall i then pay over the 
same with pitch sir moving his hand as with a pitch pot what possesses thee 
to this make a life buoy of the coffin and no more stubb mr flask 
come forward with me goes off in a huff the whole he can endure at 
the parts he baulks now i like this i make a leg for captain ahab 
and he wears it like a gentleman but i make a bandbox for queequeg and 
he put his head into it are all my pains to go for nothing with 
that coffin and now ordered to make a life buoy of it like turning an 
old coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now i like this 
cobbling sort of like it at all undignified not my place let brats do tinkerings 
we are their betters i like to take in hand none but clean virgin fair 
and square mathematical jobs something that regularly begins at the beginning and is at the 
middle when midway and comes to an end at the conclusion not a job at 
an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end the old tricks 
to be giving cobbling jobs lord what an affection all old women have for tinkers 
i know an old woman of sixty five who ran away with a bald headed 
young tinker once and the reason i never would work for lonely widow old women 
ashore when i kept my job shop in the vineyard they might have taken it 
into their lonely old heads to run off with me but heigh ho there are 
no caps at sea but snow caps let me see nail down the lid caulk 
the seams pay over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it 
with the snap spring over the stern were ever such things done before with a 
coffin some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied up in the rigging ere they 
would do the job but made of knotty aroostook hemlock i budge cruppered with a 
coffin sailing about with a grave yard tray but never mind we workers in woods 
make bridal bedsteads and card tables as well as coffins and hearses we work by 
the month or by the job or by the profit not for us to ask 
the why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling and then 
we stash it if we can hem do the job now tenderly have many in 
the company all told but forgotten any way have me thirty separate headed life lines 
each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin then if the hull go 
down be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin a sight not seen very 
often beneath the sun come hammer caulking iron pitch pot and marling spike to it 
chapter 127 the deck the coffin laid upon two line tubs between the vice bench 
and the open hatchway the carpenter caulking its seams the string of twisted oakum slowly 
unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock comes 
slowly from the cabin gangway and hears pip following him lad i will be with 
ye again presently he goes not this hand complies with my humor more genially than 
that boy aisle of a church here buoy sir mr orders oh look sir beware 
the hatchway ye man thy coffin lies handy to the vault the hatchway oh so 
it does sir so it does not thou the leg maker look did not this 
stump come from thy shop believe it did sir does the ferrule stand sir enough 
but art thou not also the undertaker sir i patched up this thing here as 
a coffin for queequeg but set me now to turning it into something else tell 
me art thou not an arrant all grasping intermeddling monopolising heathenish old scamp to be 
one day making legs and the next day coffins to clap them in and yet 
again life buoys out of those same coffins thou art as unprincipled as the gods 
and as much of a jack of all trades i do not mean anything sir 
i do as i do gods again hark ye dost thou not ever sing working 
about a coffin the titans they say hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for 
volcanoes and the grave digger in the play sings spade in hand dost thou never 
sir do i sing oh indifferent enough sir for that but the reason why the 
grave digger made music must have been because there was none in his spade sir 
but the caulking mallet is full of it hark to it and because the lid 
a sounding board and what in all things makes the sounding board is naught beneath 
and yet a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same carpenter 
hast thou ever helped carry a bier and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard 
gate going in sir that faith sir only a sort of exclamation all sir um 
go on was about to say sir thou a silk worm dost thou spin thy 
own shroud out of thyself look at thy bosom despatch and get these traps out 
of sight goes aft that was sudden now but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes 
heard that the isle of albemarle one of the gallipagos is cut by the equator 
right in the middle seems to me some sort of equator cuts yon old man 
too right in his middle always under the hot i tell ye looking this oakum 
quick here we go again this wooden mallet is the cork and the professor of 
musical tap ahab to himself a sight a sound the greyheaded woodpecker tapping the hollow 
tree blind and dumb might well be envied now see that thing rests on two 
line tubs full of tow lines a most malicious wag that fellow rat tat so 
seconds tick oh how immaterial are all materials what things real are there but imponderable 
thoughts here the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made the 
expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life a life buoy of 
a coffin does it go further can it be that in some spiritual sense the 
coffin is after all but an immortality preserver think of that but no so far 
gone am i in the dark side of earth that its other side the theoretic 
bright one seems but uncertain twilight to me will ye never have done carpenter with 
that accursed sound i go below let me not see that thing here when i 
return again now then pip talk this over i do suck most wondrous philosophies from 
thee some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee chapter 128 the 
pequod meets the rachel next day a large ship the rachel was descried bearing directly 
down upon the pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men at the time the 
pequod was making good speed through the water but as the broad winged windward stranger 
shot nigh to her the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are 
burst and all life fled from the smitten hull news she brings bad news muttered 
the old manxman but ere her commander who with trumpet to mouth stood up in 
his boat ere he could hopefully hail voice was heard seen the white whale yesterday 
have ye seen a whale boat adrift throttling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected 
question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain himself having 
stopped his way was seen descending her side a few keen pulls and his boat 
hook soon clinched the main chains and he sprang to the deck immediately he was 
recognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation was exchanged was 
he killed killed cried ahab closely advancing was it it seemed that somewhat late on 
the afternoon of the day previous while three of the boats were engaged with a 
shoal of whales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship 
and while they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head 
of moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far to 
leeward whereupon the fourth rigged reserved been instantly lowered in chase after a keen sail 
before the wind this fourth swiftest keeled of to have succeeded in least as well 
as the man at the mast head could tell anything about it in the distance 
he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water 
and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have 
indefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens there was some apprehension but no 
positive alarm as yet the recall signals were placed in the rigging darkness came on 
and forced to pick up her three far to windward going in quest of the 
fourth one in the precisely opposite ship had not only been necessitated to leave that 
boat to its fate till near midnight but for the time to increase her distance 
from it but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded 
all on the missing boat kindling a fire in her try pots for a beacon 
and every other man aloft on the look out but though when she had thus 
sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last 
seen though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her 
and not finding anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boats and 
though she had thus continued doing till daylight yet not the least glimpse of the 
missing keel had been seen the story told the stranger captain immediately went on to 
reveal his object in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with his 
own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart 
on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were will wager something 
now whispered stubb to flask some one in that missing boat wore off that best 
coat mayhap his so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two 
pious whale ships cruising after one missing whale boat in the height of the whaling 
season see flask only see how pale he in the very buttons of his the 
must have been boy my own boy is among them for beg i exclaimed the 
stranger captain to ahab who thus far had but icily received his petition eight and 
forty hours let me charter your will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for 
there be no other eight and forty hours must oh you must and you shall 
do this thing son cried stubb his son lost i take back the coat and 
says ahab we must save that boy drowned with the rest on last night said 
the old manx sailor standing behind them heard all of ye heard their spirits now 
as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the the more melancholy was 
the circumstance that not only was one of the sons among the number of the 
missing crew but among the number of the other crews at the same time but 
on the other hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase 
there had been still another son as that for a time the wretched father was 
plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which was only solved for him by 
his chief instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale ship in such emergencies that 
is when placed between jeopardized but divided boats always to pick up the majority first 
but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason had refrained from mentioning all this and 
not till forced to it by iciness did he allude to his one yet missing 
boy a little lad but twelve years old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving 
hardihood of a paternal love had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils 
and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race nor does 
it unfrequently occur that nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away 
from them for a protracted three or four voyage in some other ship than their 
own so that their first knowledge of a career shall be unenervated by any chance 
display of a natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern meantime now the 
stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab and ahab still stood like an 
anvil receiving every shock but without the least quivering of his own will not go 
said the stranger you say aye to me do to me as you would have 
me do to you in the like case for you too have a boy captain 
but a child and nestling safely at home child of your old age yes you 
relent i see run men now and stand by to square in the yards cried 
not a rope then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every gardiner i will not 
do it even now i lose time good bye good bye god bless ye man 
and may i forgive myself but i must go mr starbuck look at the binnacle 
watch and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers then brace 
forward again and let the ship sail as before hurriedly turning with averted face he 
descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection 
of his so earnest suit but starting from his enchantment gardiner silently hurried to the 
side more fell than stepped into his boat and returned to his ship soon the 
two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange vessel was in view she 
was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small on the 
sea this way and that her yards were swung round starboard and larboard she continued 
to tack now she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her before 
it while all the while her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men as 
three tall cherry trees when the boys are cherrying among the boughs but by her 
still halting course and winding woeful way you plainly saw that this ship that so 
wept with spray still remained without comfort she was rachel weeping for her children because 
they were not chapter 129 the cabin ahab moving to go on deck pip catches 
him by the hand to follow lad i tell thee thou must not follow ahab 
now the hour is coming when ahab would not scare thee from him yet would 
not have thee by him there is that in thee poor lad which i feel 
too curing to my malady like cures like and for this hunt my malady becomes 
my most desired health do thou abide below here where they shall serve thee as 
if thou wert the captain aye lad thou shalt sit here in my own screwed 
chair another screw to it thou must be no no ye have not a whole 
body sir do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg only tread 
upon me sir i ask no more so i remain a part of ye spite 
of million villains this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of man a 
black and crazy methinks like cures like applies to him too he grows so sane 
again tell me sir that stubb did once desert poor little pip whose drowned bones 
now show white for all the blackness of his living skin but i will never 
desert ye sir as stubb did him sir i must go with ye thou speakest 
thus to me much more purpose keels up in him i tell thee no it 
cannot be good master master master so and i will murder thee have a care 
for ahab too is mad listen and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon 
the deck and still know that i am there and now i quit thee thy 
hand true art thou lad as the circumference to its centre so god for ever 
bless thee and if it come to that for ever save thee let what will 
befall ahab goes pip steps one step forward he this instant stood i stand in 
his air alone now were even poor pip here i could endure it but missing 
pip pip ding dong ding seen pip he must be up here try the door 
what neither lock nor bolt nor bar and yet no opening it it must be 
the spell he told me to stay here aye and told me this screwed chair 
was mine here then seat me against the transom in the full middle all her 
keel and her three masts before me here our old sailors say in their black 
seventy fours great admirals sometimes sit at table and lord it over rows of captains 
and lieutenants ha this epaulets epaulets the epaulets all come crowding pass round the decanters 
glad to see ye fill up monsieurs what an odd feeling now when a black 
host to white men with gold lace upon their coats have ye seen one pip 
little negro lad five feet high hang dog look and cowardly jumped from a whale 
boat once him no well then fill up again captains and drink shame upon all 
cowards i name no names shame upon them put one foot upon the table shame 
upon all cowards above there i hear master master i am indeed down hearted when 
you walk over me but here stay though this stern strikes rocks and they bulge 
through and oysters come to join me chapter 130 the hat and now that at 
the proper time and place after so long and wide a preliminary cruise ahab other 
whaling waters to have chased his foe into an ocean fold to slay him the 
more securely there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude 
where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that a vessel had been spoken which 
on the very day preceding had actually encountered moby dick now that all his successive 
meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white 
whale tore his hunters whether sinning or sinned against now it was that there lurked 
a something in the old eyes which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to 
see as the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six night sustains its 
piercing steady central gaze so purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of 
the gloomy crew it domineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings fears 
were fain to hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a single spear or 
leaf in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural vanished stubb no more 
strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one alike joy and 
sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and powdered for the time in 
the clamped mortar of iron soul like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever 
conscious that the old despot eye was on them but did you deeply scan him 
in his more secret confidential hours when he thought no glance but one was on 
him then you would have seen that even as eyes so awed the the inscrutable 
glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it 
such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings 
shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain as it seemed whether 
indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck 
by some unseen body and that shadow was always hovering there for not by night 
even had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go below he would stand 
still for hours but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly 
two watchmen never rest nor at any time by night or day could the mariners 
now step upon the deck unless ahab was before them either standing in his pivot 
hole or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits main mast and the mizen 
or else they saw him standing in the cabin scuttle living foot advanced upon the 
deck as if to step his hat slouched heavily over his eyes so that however 
motionless he stood however the days and nights were added on that he had not 
swung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly 
whether for all this his eyes were really closed at times or whether he was 
still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for a 
whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded night damp gathered in beads of dew 
upon that stone carved coat and hat the clothes that the night had wet the 
next sunshine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he 
went no more beneath the planks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he 
sent for he ate in the same open air that is his two only meals 
and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled 
as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base 
though perished in the upper verdure but though his whole life was now become one 
watch on deck and though the mystic watch was without intermission as his own yet 
these two never seemed to man to the at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter 
made it necessary though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain openly 
and to the awe struck crew they seemed pole like asunder if by day they 
chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far as concerned 
the slightest verbal interchange at times for longest hours without a single hail they stood 
far parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parsee by the mainmast but 
still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown 
shadow in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance and yet somehow did his own proper 
self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinates seemed an independent 
lord the parsee but his slave still again both seemed yoked together and an unseen 
tyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib for be this parsee what 
he may all rib and keel was solid ahab at the first faintest glimmering of 
the dawn his iron voice was heard from aft the mast heads all through the 
day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking 
of the bell was see sharp but when three or four days had slided by 
after meeting the children seeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac 
old man seemed distrustful of his fidelity at least of nearly all except the pagan 
harpooneers he seemed to doubt even whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the 
sight he sought but if these suspicions were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally 
expressing them however his actions might seem to hint them will have the first sight 
of the whale myself said ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hands 
he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single 
sheaved block to secure to the main mast head he received the two ends of 
the downward reeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the 
other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with that end 
yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew 
sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon daggoo queequeg tashtego but 
shunning fedallah and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate said the 
rope give it into thy hands starbuck then arranging his person in the basket he 
gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck being the one 
who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and thus with one 
hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and 
miles astern this side and that the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a 
height when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the 
rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoisted up to 
that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstances its fastened end on 
deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special 
watch of it because in such a wilderness of running rigging whose various different relations 
aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck 
and when the deck ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down 
from the fastenings it would be but a natural fatality if unprovided with a constant 
watchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and 
fall all swooping to the sea so proceedings in this matter were not unusual the 
only strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one only man 
who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to 
of those too whose faithfulness on the look out he had seemed to doubt somewhat 
was strange that this was the very man he should select for his watchman freely 
giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted hands now the first time ahab 
was perched aloft ere he had been there ten minutes one of those red billed 
savage sea hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast heads of 
whalemen in these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head 
in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a thousand feet straight up 
into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying again round his head but with 
his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed not to mark this 
wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no 
uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of 
cunning meaning in almost every sight hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman 
who being posted at the mizen mast head stood directly behind ahab though somewhat lower 
than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them but already the 
sable wing was before the old eyes the long hooked bill at his head with 
a scream the black hawk darted away with his prize an eagle flew thrice round 
head removing his cap to replace it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin 
would be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap was that 
omen accounted good hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with 
it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point 
of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly discerned falling from that vast height 
into the sea chapter 131 the pequod meets the delight the intense pequod sailed on 
the rolling waves and days went by the life buoy coffin still lightly swung and 
another ship most miserably misnamed the delight was descried as she drew nigh all eyes 
were fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whaling ships cross the 
quarter deck at the height of eight or nine feet serving to carry the spare 
unrigged or disabled boats upon the shears were beheld the shattered white ribs and some 
few splintered planks of what had once been a whale boat but you now saw 
through this wreck as plainly as you see through the peeled half unhinged and bleaching 
skeleton of a horse seen the white whale replied the hollow cheeked captain from his 
taffrail and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck killed him harpoon is not 
yet forged that ever will do that answered the other sadly glancing upon a rounded 
hammock on the deck whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together 
forged and snatching levelled iron from the crotch ahab held it out ye nantucketer here 
in this hand i hold his death tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are 
these barbs and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the 
fin where the white whale most feels his accursed life god keep thee old thou 
to the bury but one of five stout men who were alive only yesterday but 
were dead ere night only that one i bury the rest were buried before they 
died you sail upon their tomb then turning to his ye ready there place the 
plank then on the rail and lift the body so towards the hammock with uplifted 
the resurrection and the forward up helm cried ahab like lightning to his men but 
the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash 
that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so quick indeed but 
that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism 
as ahab now glided from the dejected delight the strange life buoy hanging at the 
stern came into conspicuous relief yonder look yonder men cried a foreboding voice in her 
wake vain oh ye strangers ye fly our sad burial ye but turn us your 
taffrail to show us your coffin chapter 132 the symphony it was a clear steel 
blue day the firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all pervading 
azure only the pensive air was transparently pure and soft with a look and the 
robust and man like sea heaved with long strong lingering swells as chest in his 
sleep hither and thither on high glided the snow white wings of small unspeckled birds 
these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air but to and fro in the 
deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushed mighty leviathans sword fish and sharks and 
these were the strong troubled murderous thinkings of the masculine sea but though thus contrasting 
within the contrast was only in shades and shadows without those two seemed one it 
was only the sex as it were that distinguished them aloft like a royal czar 
and king the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea 
even as bride to groom and at the girdling line of the horizon a soft 
and tremulous seen here at the the fond throbbing trust the loving alarms with which 
the poor bride gave her bosom away tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with 
wrinkles haggardly firm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the 
ashes of ruin untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn lifting his 
splintered helmet of a brow to the fair forehead of heaven oh immortal infancy and 
innocency of the azure invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us sweet childhood of 
air and sky how oblivious were ye of old close coiled woe but so have 
i seen little miriam and martha laughing eyed elves heedlessly gambol around their old sire 
sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt 
out crater of his brain slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle ahab leaned over 
the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his 
gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the 
lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment 
the cankerous thing in his soul that glad happy air that winsome sky did at 
last stroke and caress him the step mother world so long threw affectionate arms round 
his stubborn neck and did seem to joyously sob over him as if over one 
that however wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save 
and to bless from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea 
nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop starbuck saw 
the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed 
to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the 
centre of the serenity around careful not to touch him or be noticed by him 
he yet drew near to him and stood there ahab turned starbuck it is a 
mild mild wind and a mild looking sky on such a much such a sweetness 
as struck my first boy harpooneer of eighteen years ago forty years of continual whaling 
forty years of privation and peril and storm time forty years on the pitiless sea 
for forty years has ahab forsaken the peaceful land for forty years to make war 
on the horrors of the deep aye and yes starbuck out of those forty years 
i have not spent three ashore when i think of this life i have led 
the desolation of solitude it has been the masoned walled town of a exclusiveness which 
admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country weariness heaviness guinea coast 
slavery of solitary command i think of all this only half suspected not so keenly 
known to me how for forty years i have fed upon dry salted emblem of 
the dry nourishment of my soil the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his 
daily hand and broken the fresh bread to my mouldy whole oceans away from that 
young girl wife i wedded past fifty and sailed for cape horn the next day 
leaving but one dent in my marriage wife a widow with her husband alive aye 
i widowed that poor girl when i married her starbuck and then the madness the 
frenzy the boiling blood and the smoking brow with which for a thousand lowerings old 
ahab has furiously foamingly chased his a demon than a man aye what a forty 
fool has old ahab been why this strife of the chase why weary and palsy 
the arm at the oar and the iron and the lance how the richer or 
better is ahab now behold oh starbuck is it not hard that with this weary 
load i bear one poor leg should have been snatched from under me here brush 
this old hair aside it blinds me that i seem to weep locks so grey 
did never grow but from out some ashes but do i look very old so 
very very old starbuck i feel deadly faint bowed and humped as though i were 
adam staggering beneath the piled centuries since paradise god god god my heart my brain 
mockery bitter biting mockery of grey hairs have i lived enough joy to wear ye 
and seem and feel thus intolerably old close stand close to me starbuck let me 
look into a human eye it is better than to gaze into sea or sky 
better than to gaze upon god by the green land by the bright hearth stone 
this is the magic glass man i see my wife and my child in thine 
eye no no stay on board on board not when i do when branded ahab 
gives chase to moby dick that hazard shall not be thine no no not with 
the far away home i see in that eye my captain my captain noble soul 
grand old heart after all why should any one give chase to that hated fish 
away with me let us fly these deadly waters let us home wife and child 
too are and child of his brotherly sisterly play fellow youth even as thine sir 
are the wife and child of thy loving longing paternal old age away let us 
away instant let me alter the course how cheerily how hilariously o my captain would 
we bowl on our way to see old nantucket again i think sir they have 
some such mild blue days even as this in nantucket have they have i have 
seen summer days in the morning about this it is his noon nap boy vivaciously 
wakes sits up in bed and his mother tells him of me of cannibal old 
me how i am abroad upon the deep but will yet come back to dance 
him again my mary my mary herself she promised that my boy every morning should 
be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his sail yes yes 
no more it is done we head for nantucket come my captain study out the 
course and let us away see see the face from the window the hand on 
the hill but glance was averted like a blighted fruit tree he shook and cast 
his last cindered apple to the soil is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is 
it what cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor commands me that against 
all natural lovings and longings i so keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on 
all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural 
heart i durst not so much as dare is ahab ahab is it i god 
or who that lifts this arm but if the great sun move not of himself 
but is as an errand boy in heaven nor one single star can revolve but 
by some invisible power how then can this one small heart beat this one small 
brain think thoughts unless god does that beating does that thinking does that living and 
not i by heaven man we are turned round and round in this world like 
yonder windlass and fate is the handspike and all the time lo that smiling sky 
and this unsounded sea look see yon albicore who put it into him to chase 
and fang that flying fish where do murderers go man to doom when the judge 
himself is dragged to the bar but it is a mild mild wind and a 
mild looking sky and the air smells now as if it blew from a far 
away meadow they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes starbuck 
and the mowers are sleeping among the new mown hay sleeping aye toil we how 
we may we all sleep at last on the field sleep aye and rust amid 
greenness as last scythes flung down and left in the half cut but blanched to 
a hue with despair the mate had stolen away ahab crossed the deck to gaze 
over on the other side but started at two reflected fixed eyes in the water 
there fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail chapter 133 the day that night 
in the mid watch when the old his wont at forth from the scuttle in 
which he leaned and went to his pivot hole he suddenly thrust out his face 
fiercely snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious dog will in drawing nigh to 
some barbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon that peculiar odor 
sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale was palpable to 
all the watch nor was any mariner surprised when after inspecting the compass and then 
the dog vane and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as 
possible ahab rapidly ordered the course to be slightly altered and the sail to be 
shortened the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak by the sight 
of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and 
resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it the polished metallic like marks of some 
swift tide rip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream the mast heads call 
all hands thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck daggoo 
roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle 
so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands see cried ahab flattening 
his face to the sky nothing sir was the sound hailing down in reply sails 
alow and aloft and on both sides all sail being set he now cast loose 
the life line reserved for swaying him to the main royal mast head and in 
a few moments they were hoisting him thither when while but two thirds of the 
way aloft and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main top sail 
and top gallant sail he raised a gull like cry in the air she blows 
she blows a hump like a snow hill it is moby dick fired by the 
cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look outs the men on deck 
rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing 
ahab had now gained his final perch some feet above the other look outs tashtego 
standing just beneath him on the cap of the top gallant mast so that the 
head was almost on a level with heel from this height the whale was now 
seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing his high 
sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air to the credulous mariners 
it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit 
atlantic and indian oceans did none of ye see it before cried ahab hailing the 
perched men all around him saw him almost that same instant sir that captain ahab 
did and i cried out said tashtego the same instant not the the doubloon is 
mine fate reserved the doubloon for me i only none of ye could have raised 
the white whale first there she blows she blows she blows there again again he 
cried in long drawn lingering methodic tones attuned to the gradual prolongings of the visible 
jets going to sound in stunsails down top gallant sails stand by three boats mr 
starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship helm there luff luff a point 
so steady man steady there go flukes no no only black water all ready the 
boats there stand by stand by lower me mr starbuck lower lower quicker and he 
slid through the air to the deck is heading straight to leeward sir cried stubb 
away from us cannot have seen the ship yet dumb man stand by the braces 
hard down the helm up shiver her her well that boats boats soon all the 
boats but were dropped all the boat sails the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting 
to leeward and ahab heading the onset a pale death glimmer lit up sunken eyes 
a hideous motion gnawed his mouth like noiseless nautilus shells their light prows sped through 
the sea but only slowly they neared the foe as they neared him the ocean 
grew still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over its waves seemed a noon meadow 
so serenely it spread at length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting 
prey that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible sliding along the sea as if 
an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish foam 
he saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond before it far 
out on the soft turkish rugged waters went the glistening white shadow from his broad 
milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue waters interchangeably 
flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright 
bubbles arose and danced by his side but these were broken again by the light 
toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea alternate with their fitful flight 
and like to some flag staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy the 
tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white back and at 
intervals one of the cloud of soft toed fowls hovering and to and fro skimming 
like a canopy over the fish silently perched and rocked on this pole the long 
tail feathers streaming like pennons a gentle mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the 
gliding whale not the white bull jupiter swimming away with ravished europa clinging to his 
graceful horns his lovely leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness 
rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that great majesty supreme 
did surpass the glorified white whale as he so divinely swam on each soft with 
the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide each bright side 
the whale shed off enticings no wonder there had been some among the hunters who 
namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity had ventured to assail it but had 
fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes yet calm enticing calm oh whale 
thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no matter how 
many in that same way thou have bejuggled and destroyed before and thus through the 
serene tranquillities of the tropical sea among waves whose hand clappings were suspended by exceeding 
rapture moby dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged 
trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw but soon the fore part of 
him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a 
high arch like natural bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air the 
grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight hoveringly halting and dipping on 
the wing the white sea fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left 
with oars apeak and paddles down the sheets of their sails adrift the three boats 
now stilly floated awaiting moby reappearance hour said ahab standing rooted in his stern and 
he gazed beyond the place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to 
leeward it was only an instant for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his 
head as he swept the watery circle the breeze now freshened the sea began to 
swell birds birds cried tashtego in long indian file as when herons take wing the 
white birds were now all flying towards boat and when within a few yards began 
fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous expectant cries their vision 
was keener than ahab could discover no sign in the sea but suddenly as he 
peered down and down into its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no 
bigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose till 
it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white glistening 
teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom it was moby open mouth and scrolled jaw 
his vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea the glittering 
mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open doored marble tomb and giving one sidelong 
sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition then 
calling upon fedallah to change places with him went forward to the bows and seizing 
harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern now by 
reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its bow by anticipation 
was made to face the head while yet under water but as if perceiving this 
stratagem moby dick with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself as it 
were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat through and through 
through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying 
on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its 
bows full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high 
up into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a row lock 
the bluish pearl white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of 
head and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whale now shook the 
slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse with unastonished eyes fedallah gazed and 
crossed his arms but the tiger yellow crew were tumbling over each heads to gain 
the uttermost stern and now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as 
the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his body 
being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from the bows for 
the bows were almost inside of him as it were and while the other boats 
involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then it was that monomaniac 
ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and 
helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized the long 
bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe as 
now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwales bent in 
collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enormous shears sliding further aft bit the 
craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the 
two floating wrecks these floated aside the broken ends drooping the crew at the stern 
wreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash 
them across at that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped ahab the first 
to perceive the intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed 
his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one final effort 
to push the boat out of the bite but only slipping further into the mouth 
and tilting over sideways as it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on 
the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so 
he fell flat faced upon the sea ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now 
lay at a little distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in 
the billows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body so that 
when his vast wrinkled forehead twenty or more feet out of the now rising swells 
with all their confluent waves dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray still 
higher into the air so in a gale the but half baffled channel billows only 
recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud 
this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives its designation pitchpoling from its 
being likened to that preliminary up and down poise of the whale lance in the 
exercise called pitchpoling previously described by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively 
view whatever objects may be encircling him but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick 
swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful 
wake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault the sight 
of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the blood of grapes and mulberries 
cast before elephants in the book of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam 
of the insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swim he could still 
keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless head was 
seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst from the fragmentary 
stern fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end 
could not succor him more than enough was it for them to look to themselves 
for so revolvingly appalling was the white aspect and so planetarily swift the ever contracting 
circles he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them and though the other boats 
unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike 
lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways ahab 
and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape with straining eyes 
then they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now 
become the old head meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the 
mast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene and was 
now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed her on that moment a breaking 
sea dashed on him from moby dick and whelmed him for the time but struggling 
out of it again and chancing to rise on a towering crest he shouted on 
the whale him off the prows were pointed and breaking up the charmed circle she 
effectually parted the white whale from his victim as he sullenly swam off the boats 
flew to the rescue dragged into boat with blood shot blinded eyes the white brine 
caking in his wrinkles the long tension of bodily strength did crack and helplessly he 
yielded to his doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottom of boat 
like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants far inland nameless wails came from 
him as desolate sounds from out ravines but this intensity of his physical prostration did 
but so much the more abbreviate it in an compass great hearts sometimes condense to 
one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler whole 
lives and so such hearts though summary in each one suffering still if the gods 
decree it in their life time aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up 
of instantaneous intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures contain the entire 
circumferences of inferior souls harpoon said ahab half way rising and draggingly leaning on one 
bended it safe sir for it was not darted this is it said stubb showing 
it it before me missing men two three four five were five oars sir and 
here are five men good me man i wish to stand so so i see 
him there there going to leeward still what a leaping spout off from me the 
eternal sap runs up in bones again set the sail out oars the helm it 
is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew being picked up 
by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus continued 
with what is called double banked oars it was thus now but the added power 
of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale for he seemed 
to have treble banked his every fin swimming with a velocity which plainly showed that 
if now under these circumstances pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged if 
not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such 
an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some one 
brief vicissitude the ship itself then as it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate 
means of overtaking the chase accordingly the boats now made for her and were soon 
swayed up to their two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by 
then hoisting everything to her side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching 
it with stun sails like the double jointed wings of an albatross the pequod bore 
down in the leeward wake of moby dick at the well known methodic intervals the 
glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast heads and when he would be 
reported as just gone down ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck 
binnacle watch in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired 
his voice was heard is the doubloon now see him and if the reply was 
no sir straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch in this way 
the day wore on ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing the planks as 
he was thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft or to 
bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still greater 
to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own 
wrecked boat which had been dropped upon the quarter deck and lay there reversed broken 
bow to shattered stern at last he paused before it and as in an already 
over clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old 
face there now stole some such added gloom as this stubb saw him pause and 
perhaps intending not vainly though to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up 
a valiant place in his mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck thistle the ass 
refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha soulless thing is this that 
laughs before a wreck man man did i not know thee brave as fearless fire 
and as mechanical i could swear thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be 
heard before a wreck sir said starbuck drawing near a solemn sight an omen and 
an ill one omen dictionary if the gods think to speak outright to man they 
will honorably speak outright not shake their heads and give an old darkling hint ye 
two are the opposite poles of one thing starbuck is stubb reversed and stubb is 
starbuck and ye two are all mankind and ahab stands alone among the millions of 
the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neighbors cold shiver now aloft there see 
him sing out for every spout though he spout ten times a second the day 
was nearly done only the hem of his golden robe was rustling soon it was 
almost dark but the look out men still remained unset see the spout now sir 
a voice from the air heading when last seen before sir to leeward he will 
travel slower now night down royals and top gallant stun sails mr starbuck we must 
not run over him before morning making a passage now and may heave to a 
while helm there keep her full before the wind come down stubb send a fresh 
hand to the fore mast head and see it manned till morning advancing towards the 
doubloon in the main this gold is mine for i earned it but i shall 
let it abide here till the white whale is dead and then whosoever of ye 
first raises him upon the day he shall be killed this gold is that and 
if on that day i shall again raise him then ten times its sum shall 
be divided among all of ye away now deck is thine sir and so saying 
he placed himself half way within the scuttle and slouching his hat stood there till 
dawn except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on chapter 
134 the day at day break the three mast heads were punctually manned afresh see 
him cried ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread nothing sir 
up all hands and make sail he travels faster than i thought for top gallant 
sails they should have been kept on her all night but no but resting for 
the rush here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continued 
through day into night and through night into day is a thing by no means 
unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such is the wonderful skill prescience of experience 
and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders that from 
the simple observation of a whale when last descried they will under certain given circumstances 
pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a 
time while out of sight as well as his probable rate of progression during that 
period and in these cases somewhat as a pilot when about losing sight of a 
coast whose general trending he well knows and which he desires shortly to return to 
again but at some further point like as this pilot stands by his compass and 
takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more certainly 
to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so does the fisherman 
at his compass with the whale for after being chased and diligently marked through several 
hours of daylight then when night obscures the fish the future wake through the darkness 
is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the coast is 
to him so that to this wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ 
in water a wake is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the 
steadfast land and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly 
known in its every pace that with watches in their hands men time his rate 
as doctors that of a pulse and lightly say of it the up train or 
the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an 
hour even so almost there are occasions when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of 
the deep according to the observed humor of his speed and say to themselves so 
many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles will have about reached 
this or that degree of latitude or longitude but to render this acuteness at all 
successful in the end the wind and the sea must be the allies for of 
what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him 
he is exactly ninety three leagues and a quarter from his port inferable from these 
statements are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales the ship tore on 
leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon ball missent becomes a 
plough share and turns up the level field salt and hemp cried stubb this swift 
motion of the deck creeps up legs and tingles at the heart this ship and 
i are two brave fellows ha some one take me up and launch me spine 
wise on the sea by live oaks my a keel ha ha we go the 
gait that leaves no dust behind she blows blows ahead was now the mast head 
cry aye cried stubb knew on and split your spout o whale the mad fiend 
himself is after ye blow your your lungs will dam off your blood as a 
miller shuts his watergate upon the stream and stubb did but speak out for well 
nigh all that crew the frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them 
bubblingly up like old wine worked anew whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them 
might have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the 
growing awe of ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed as 
timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison the hand of fate had snatched 
all their souls and by the stirring perils of the previous day the rack of 
the past suspense the fixed unfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went 
plunging towards its flying mark by all these things their hearts were bowled along the 
wind that made great bellies of their sails and rushed the vessel on by arms 
invisible as irresistible this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them 
to the race they were one man not thirty for as the one ship that 
held them all though it was put together of all contrasting and maple and pine 
wood iron and pitch and all these ran into each other in the one concrete 
hull which shot on its way both balanced and directed by the long central keel 
even so all the individualities of the crew this valor that fear guilt and guiltiness 
all varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal goal which 
ahab their one lord and keel did point to the rigging lived the mast heads 
like the tops of tall palms were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs clinging to 
a spar with one hand some reached forth the other with impatient wavings others shading 
their eyes from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking yards all the 
spars in full bearing of mortals ready and ripe for their fate ah how they 
still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them 
sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried ahab when after the 
lapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had been heard me up 
men ye have been deceived not moby dick casts one odd jet that way and 
then disappears it was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some 
other thing for the whale spout as the event itself soon proved for hardly had 
ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck when 
he struck the key note to an orchestra that made the air vibrate as with 
the combined discharges of rifles the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard nearer 
to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile dick 
bodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings not by the 
peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the white whale now reveal 
his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching rising with his utmost 
velocity from the furthest depths the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the 
pure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place 
to the distance of seven miles and more in those moments the torn enraged waves 
he shakes off seem his mane in some cases this breaching is his act of 
defiance she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in his immeasurable bravadoes the 
white whale tossed himself salmon like to heaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain 
of the sea and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray 
that he raised for the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and stood 
there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity to the dim mistiness 
of an advancing shower in a vale breach your last to the sun moby dick 
cried ahab hour and thy harpoon are at hand down all of ye but one 
man at the fore the boats by unmindful of the tedious rope ladders of the 
shrouds the men like shooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstays and 
halyards while ahab less dartingly but still rapidly was dropped from his perch away he 
cried so soon as he had reached his spare one rigged the afternoon previous starbuck 
the ship is away from the boats but keep near them lower all as if 
to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first assailant himself 
moby dick had turned and was now coming for the three crews boat was central 
and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale head and head 
is pull straight up to his forehead not uncommon thing for when within a certain 
limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the sidelong vision but ere that 
close limit was gained and while yet all three boats were plain as the three 
masts to his eye the white whale churning himself into furious speed almost in an 
instant as it were rushing among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail 
offered appalling battle on every side and heedless of the irons darted at him from 
every boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were 
made but skilfully manœuvred incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for 
a while eluded him though at times but by a breadth while all the time 
unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds but at last in his 
untraceable evolutions the white whale so crossed and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled 
the slack of the three lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of 
themselves warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though now for a 
moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more tremendous 
charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out more line and then was rapidly hauling 
and jerking in upon it that way to disencumber it of some lo sight more 
savage than the embattled teeth of sharks caught and in the mazes of the line 
loose harpoons and lances with all their bristling barbs and points came flashing and dripping 
up to the chocks in the bows of boat only one thing could be done 
seizing the boat knife he critically reached then rays of steel dragged in the line 
beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sundering the rope near the 
the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea and was all fast again that instant 
the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines 
by so doing irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flask towards his 
flukes dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf beaten beach and then 
diving down into the sea disappeared in a boiling maelstrom in which for a space 
the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round like the grated nutmeg 
in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch while the two crews were yet circling in 
the waters reaching out after the revolving line tubs oars and other floating furniture while 
aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching his legs upwards 
to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks and stubb was lustily singing out for some 
one to ladle him up and while the old of his pulling into the creamy 
pool to rescue whom he could that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils yet 
unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wires arrow like shooting perpendicularly from 
the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom and sent it 
turning over and over into the air till it fell ahab and his men struggled 
out from under it like seals from a sea side cave the first uprising momentum 
of the its direction as he struck the launched him along it to a little 
distance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his back to 
it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to 
side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of 
the boats touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and came sideways smiting the 
sea but soon as if satisfied that his work for that time was done he 
pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean and trailing after him the intertangled lines continued 
his leeward way at a methodic pace as before the attentive ship having descried the 
whole fight again came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up 
the floating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught at and safely landed 
them on her decks some sprained shoulders wrists and ankles livid contusions wrenched harpoons and 
lances inextricable intricacies of rope shattered oars and planks all these were there but no 
fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one as with fedallah the 
day before so ahab was now found grimly clinging to his broken half which afforded 
a comparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him as the previous mishap but 
when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fastened upon him as instead 
of standing by himself he still half hung upon the shoulder of starbuck who had 
thus far been the foremost to assist him his ivory leg had been snapped off 
leaving but one short sharp splinter aye starbuck sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner 
who he will and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has ferrule has 
not stood sir said the carpenter now coming up put good work into that leg 
no bones broken sir i hope said stubb with true concern and all splintered to 
pieces stubb see it even with a broken bone old ahab is untouched and i 
account no living bone of mine one jot more me than this dead one lost 
nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old ahab in 
his own proper and inaccessible being can any lead touch yonder floor any mast scrape 
yonder roof there which way to leeward sir helm then pile on the sail again 
ship keepers down the rest of the spare boats and rig starbuck away and muster 
the crews me first help thee towards the bulwarks sir oh oh how this splinter 
gores me now accursed fate that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such 
a craven mate body man not thee give me something for a that shivered lance 
will do muster the men surely i have not seen him yet by heaven it 
cannot be call them all the old hinted thought was true upon mustering the company 
the parsee was not there parsee cried must have been caught black vomit wrench thee 
all of ye above alow cabin gone but quickly they returned to him with the 
tidings that the parsee was nowhere to be found sir said among the tangles of 
your thought i saw him dragging under my line my line gone what means that 
little word death knell rings in it that old ahab shakes as if he were 
the belfry the harpoon too over the litter there see it forged iron men the 
white no no fool this hand did dart it in the fish there keep him 
hands to the rigging of the the the irons the irons the royals pull on 
all the sheets there steady steady for your life ten times girdle the unmeasured globe 
yea and dive straight through it but slay him yet god but for one single 
instant show thyself cried starbuck never wilt thou capture him old name no more of 
this worse than madness two days chased twice stove to splinters thy very leg once 
more snatched from under thee thy evil shadow good angels mobbing thee with warnings more 
wouldst thou have we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man 
shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea shall we be 
towed by him to the infernal world oh oh and blasphemy to hunt him more 
of late felt strangely moved to thee ever since that hour we both what in 
one eyes but in this matter of the whale be the front of thy face 
to me as the palm of this lipless unfeatured blank ahab is for ever ahab 
man this whole immutably decreed rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this 
ocean rolled fool i am the lieutenant i act under orders look thou underling that 
thou obeyest mine round me men ye see an old man cut down to the 
stump leaning on a shivered lance propped up on a lonely foot part but a 
centipede that moves upon a hundred legs i feel strained half stranded as ropes that 
tow dismasted frigates in a gale and i may look so but ere i break 
hear me crack and till ye hear that know that hawser tows his purpose yet 
believe ye men in the things called omens then laugh aloud and cry encore for 
ere they drown drowning things will twice rise to the surface then rise again to 
sink for evermore so with moby days will be the third aye men rise once 
more only to spout his last feel brave men brave fearless fire cried stubb as 
mechanical muttered ahab then as the men went forward he muttered on things called omens 
and yesterday i talked the same to starbuck there concerning my broken boat oh how 
valiantly i seek to drive out of hearts clinched so fast in mine parsee gone 
and he was to go before still was to be seen again ere i could 
that a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the 
whole line of judges a beak it pecks my brain solve it though when dusk 
descended the whale was still in sight to leeward so once more the sail was 
shortened and everything passed nearly as on the previous night only the sound of hammers 
and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight as the men toiled 
by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their 
fresh weapons for the morrow meantime of the broken keel of wrecked craft the carpenter 
made him another leg while still as on the night before slouched ahab stood fixed 
within his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial sat due 
eastward for the earliest sun chapter 135 the chase day the morning of the third 
day dawned fair and fresh and once more the solitary night man at the fore 
mast head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look outs who dotted every mast 
and almost every spar see him cried ahab but the whale was not yet in 
sight his infallible wake though but follow that wake all helm there steady as thou 
goest and hast been going what a lovely day again were it a new made 
world and made for a summer house to the angels and this morning the first 
of its throwing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that world 
food for thought had ahab time to think but ahab never thinks he only feels 
feels feels tingling enough for mortal man to audacity god only has that right and 
privilege thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a calmness and our poor 
hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much for that and yet sometimes thought 
my brain was very calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which 
the contents turned to ice and shiver it and still this hair is growing now 
this moment growing and heat must breed it but no like that sort of common 
grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius 
lava how the wild winds blow it they whip it about me as the torn 
shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to a vile wind that 
has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells and wards of hospitals 
and ventilated them and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces out upon it 
tainted were i the wind blow no more on such a wicked miserable world crawl 
somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet a noble and heroic thing the 
wind who ever conquered it in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow 
run tilting at it and you but run through it ha a coward wind that 
strikes stark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow even ahab 
is a braver nobler thing than that would now the wind but had a body 
but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these things are 
bodiless but only bodiless as objects not as agents a most special a most cunning 
oh a most malicious difference and yet i say again and swear it now that 
something all glorious and gracious in the wind these warm trade winds at least that 
in the clear heavens blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous mildness and veer 
not from their mark however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack 
and mightiest mississippies of the land swift and swerve about uncertain where to go at 
last and by the eternal poles these same trades that so directly blow my good 
ship on these trades or something like so unchangeable and full as strong blow my 
keeled soul along to it aloft there what see sir and noon at hand the 
doubloon goes a begging see the sun aye aye it must be so oversailed him 
how got the start aye chasing me now not i him bad i might have 
known it too fool the harpoons towing aye aye i have run him by last 
night about about come down all of ye but the regular look outs man the 
braces steering as she had done the wind had been somewhat on the quarter so 
that now being pointed in the reverse direction the braced ship sailed hard upon the 
breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake the wind he now 
steers for the open jaw murmured starbuck to himself as he coiled the new hauled 
main brace upon the rail keep us but already my bones feel damp within me 
and from the inside wet my flesh i misdoubt me that i disobey my god 
in obeying him by to sway me up cried ahab advancing to the hempen basket 
should meet him soon aye sir and straightway starbuck did bidding and once more ahab 
swung on high a whole hour now passed gold beaten out to ages time itself 
now held long breaths with keen suspense but at last some three points off the 
weather bow ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three mast heads three 
shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it to forehead i 
meet thee this third time moby dick on deck there sharper up crowd her into 
the eye too far off to lower yet mr starbuck the sails shake stand over 
that helmsman with a top maul so so he travels fast and i must down 
but let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea time 
for that an old old sight and yet somehow so young aye and not changed 
a wink since i first saw it a boy from the sand hills of nantucket 
the same same same to noah as to me a soft shower to leeward such 
lovely leewardings they must lead something else than common land more palmy than the palms 
leeward the white whale goes that way look to windward then the better if the 
bitterer quarter but good bye good bye old mast head this aye tiny mosses in 
these warped cracks no such green weather stains on head the difference now between old 
age and but aye old mast we both grow old together sound in our hulls 
though are we not my ship aye minus a leg all by heaven this dead 
wood has the better of my live flesh every way i compare with it and 
known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the 
most vital stuff of vital fathers that he said he should still go before me 
my pilot and yet to be seen again but where will i have eyes at 
the bottom of the sea supposing i descend those endless stairs and all night been 
sailing from him wherever he did sink to aye aye like many more thou direful 
truth as touching thyself o parsee but ahab there thy shot fell short good bye 
mast a good eye upon the whale the while gone talk to morrow nay to 
night when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail he gave 
the word and still gazing round him was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air 
to the deck in due time the boats were lowered but as standing in his 
stern ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent he waved to the mate 
held one of the tackle ropes on bade him pause the third time my ship 
starts upon this voyage starbuck sir thou wilt have it so ships sail from their 
ports and ever afterwards are missing starbuck sir saddest truth men die at ebb tide 
some at low water some at the full of the flood i feel now like 
a billow all one crested comb starbuck i am old hands with me man their 
hands met their eyes fastened tears the glue my captain my captain not a brave 
man that weeps how great the agony of the persuasion then away ahab tossing the 
arm from him by the crew in an instant the boat was pulling round close 
under the stern sharks the sharks cried a voice from the low cabin window there 
master my master come back but ahab heard nothing for his own voice was high 
lifted then and the boat leaped on yet the voice spake true for scarce had 
he pushed from the ship when numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark 
waters beneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they 
dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites it 
is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale boats in those swarming seas the 
sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over 
the banners of marching regiments in the east but these were the first sharks that 
had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried and 
whether it was that crew were all such tiger yellow barbarians and therefore their flesh 
more musky to the senses of the matter sometimes well known to affect them it 
was they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others of wrought steel 
murmured starbuck gazing over the side and following with his eyes the receding thou yet 
ring boldly to that sight thy keel among ravening sharks and followed by them open 
mouthed to the chase and this the critical third day when three days flow together 
in one continuous intense pursuit be sure the first is the morning the second the 
noon and the third the evening and the end of that that end what it 
may oh my god what is this that shoots through me and leaves me so 
deadly calm yet expectant at the top of a shudder future things swim before me 
as in empty outlines and skeletons all the past is somehow grown dim mary girl 
thou fadest in pale glories behind me boy i seem to see but thy eyes 
grown wondrous blue strangest problems of life seem clearing but clouds sweep my end coming 
my legs feel faint like his who has footed it all day feel thy heart 
it yet stir thyself starbuck it move speak aloud head there see ye my hand 
on the hill there thy keenest eye upon the boats well the whale again off 
that hawk see he tears the to the red flag flying at the main he 
soars away with it the old man now thou that sight oh ahab shudder the 
boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mast downward pointed 
arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at 
the next rising he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel the 
becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence as the head beat waves hammered and hammered against 
the opposing bow drive in your nails oh ye waves to their uttermost heads drive 
them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no coffin and no 
hearse can be mine hemp only can kill me ha ha suddenly the waters around 
them slowly swelled in broad circles then quickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a 
submerged berg of ice swiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound was heard 
a subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with trailing ropes and 
harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea shrouded in 
a thin drooping veil of mist it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air 
and then fell swamping back into the deep crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed 
for an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes 
leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale 
way cried ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward to the attack but 
maddened by fresh irons that corroded in him moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all 
the angels that fell from heaven the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad 
white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together as head on he came churning 
his tail among the boats and once more flailed them apart spilling out the irons 
and lances from the two boats and dashing in one side of the upper part 
of their bows but leaving almost without a scar while daggoo and queequeg were stopping 
the strained planks and as the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one 
entire flank as he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went 
up lashed round and round to the back pinioned in the turns upon turns in 
which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around 
him the half torn body of the parsee was seen his sable raiment frayed to 
shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab the harpoon dropped from his hand 
befooled in a long lean parsee i see thee again and thou goest before and 
this this then is the hearse that thou didst promise but i hold thee to 
the last letter of thy word where is the second hearse away mates to the 
ship those boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return 
to me if not ahab is enough to men the first thing that but offers 
to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are not 
other men but my arms and my legs and so obey me the whale gone 
down again but he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escaping 
with the corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounter 
had been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick was now again steadily 
swimming forward and had almost passed the ship thus far had been sailing in the 
contrary direction to him though for the present her headway had been stopped he seemed 
swimming with his utmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path 
in the sea ahab cried starbuck too late is it even now the third day 
to desist see moby dick seeks thee not it is thou thou that madly seekest 
him setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward 
by both oars and canvas and at last when ahab was sliding by the vessel 
so near as plainly to distinguish face as he leaned over the rail he hailed 
him to turn the vessel about and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious 
interval glancing upwards he saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three mast 
heads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just 
been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them one after 
the other through the port holes as he sped he also caught flying glimpses of 
stubb and flask busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances as 
he saw all this as he heard the hammers in the broken boats far other 
hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking that 
the vane or flag was gone from the main mast head he shouted to tashtego 
who had just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer 
and nails and so nail it to the mast whether fagged by the three running 
chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether 
it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the white way 
now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once 
more though indeed the last start had not been so long a one as before 
and still as ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him and so 
pertinaciously stuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the 
blades became jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost every 
dip them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars pull on the 
better rest the jaw than the yielding water at every bite sir the thin blades 
grow smaller and smaller will last long enough pull on who can these sharks swim 
to feast on the whale or on ahab pull on aye all alive near him 
the helm take the helm let me pass so saying two of the oarsmen helped 
him forward to the bows of the still flying boat at length as the craft 
was cast to one side and ran ranging along with the white flank he seemed 
strangely oblivious of its the whale sometimes ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist 
which thrown off from the spout curled round his great monadnock hump he was even 
thus close to him when with body arched back and both arms lengthwise high lifted 
to the poise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the 
hated whale as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked into 
a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow and 
without staving a hole in it so suddenly canted the boat over that had it 
not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung ahab 
would once more have been tossed into the sea as it was three of the 
foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its were 
flung out but so fell that in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale 
again and rising to its level on a combing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again 
the third man helplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimming almost simultaneously with a 
mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering sea but 
when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and 
hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow 
the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain 
and tug it snapped in the empty air breaks in me some sinew cracks whole 
again oars oars burst in upon him hearing the tremendous rush of the sea crashing 
boat the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that 
evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing in it 
the source of all his persecutions bethinking may larger and nobler foe of a sudden 
he bore down upon its advancing prow smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam 
ahab staggered his hand smote his forehead grow blind hands stretch out before me that 
i may yet grope my way night whale the ship cried the cringing oarsmen oars 
slope downwards to thy depths o sea that ere it be for ever too late 
ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark i see the ship the 
ship dash on my men will ye not save my ship but as the oarsmen 
violently forced their boat through the sledge hammering seas the before whale smitten bow ends 
of two planks burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay 
nearly level with the waves its half wading splashing crew trying hard to stop the 
gap and bale out the pouring water meantime for that one beholding instant mast head 
hammer remained suspended in his hand and the red flag half wrapping him as with 
a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him as his own forward flowing heart 
while starbuck and stubb standing upon the bowsprit beneath caught sight of the down coming 
monster just as soon as he whale the whale up helm up helm oh all 
ye sweet powers of air now hug me close let not starbuck die if die 
he must in a fainting fit up helm i fools the jaw the jaw is 
this the end of all my bursting prayers all my life long fidelities oh ahab 
ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again he turns to 
meet us oh his unappeasable brow drives on towards one whose duty tells him he 
cannot depart my god stand by me now not by me but stand under me 
whoever you are that will now help stubb for stubb too sticks here i grin 
at thee thou grinning whale who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but own 
unwinking eye and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all 
too soft would it were stuffed with brushwood i grin at thee thou grinning whale 
look ye sun moon and stars i call ye assassins of as good a fellow 
as ever spouted up his ghost for all that i would yet ring glasses with 
ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh thou grinning whale but 
be plenty of gulping soon why fly ye not o ahab for me off shoes 
and jacket to it let stubb die in his drawers a most mouldy and over 
salted death though cherries cherries oh flask for one red cherry ere we die i 
only wish that we were where they grow oh stubb i hope my poor drawn 
my part pay ere this if not few coppers will now come to her for 
the voyage is up from the bows nearly all the seamen now hung inactive hammers 
bits of plank lances and harpoons mechanically retained in their hands just as they had 
darted from their various employments all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale which from 
side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular 
foam before him as he rushed retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in his whole 
aspect and spite of all that mortal man could do the solid white buttress of 
his forehead smote the starboard bow till men and timbers reeled some fell flat upon 
their faces like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull 
like necks through the breach they heard the waters pour as mountain torrents down a 
flume ship the hearse second hearse cried ahab from the boat wood could only be 
american diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel but turning 
under water swiftly shot to the surface again far off the other bow but within 
a few yards of boat where for a time he lay quiescent turn my body 
from the sun what ho tashtego let me hear thy hammer oh ye three unsurrendered 
spires of mine thou uncracked keel and only god bullied hull thou firm deck and 
haughty helm and pole pointed prow glorious ship must ye then perish and without me 
am i cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains oh lonely 
death on lonely life oh now i feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost 
grief ho ho from all your furthest bounds pour ye now in ye bold billows 
of my whole foregone life and top this one piled comber of my death towards 
thee i roll thou all destroying but unconquering whale to the last i grapple with 
thee from heart i stab at thee for sake i spit my last breath at 
thee sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can 
be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to 
thee thou damned whale thus i give up the spear the harpoon was darted the 
stricken whale flew forward with igniting velocity the line ran through the grooves foul ahab 
stooped to clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught him round 
the neck and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim he was shot out of 
the boat ere the crew knew he was gone next instant the heavy eye splice 
in the final end flew out of the stark empty tub knocked down an oarsman 
and smiting the sea disappeared in its depths for an instant the tranced crew stood 
still then turned ship great god where is the ship soon they through dim bewildering 
mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in the gaseous fata morgana only the uppermost 
masts out of water while fixed by infatuation or fidelity or fate to their once 
lofty perches the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea and now 
concentric circles seized the lone boat itself and all its crew and each floating oar 
and every lance pole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and round in one 
vortex carried the smallest chip of the pequod out of sight but as the last 
whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving 
a few inches of the erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of 
the flag which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying billows they almost touched 
that instant a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air 
in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar 
a sky hawk that tauntingly had followed the main truck downwards from its natural home 
among the stars pecking at the flag and incommoding tashtego there this bird now chanced 
to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling 
that etherial thrill the submerged savage beneath in his death gasp kept his hammer frozen 
there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shrieks and his imperial beak thrust 
upwards and his whole captive form folded in the flag of ahab went down with 
his ship which like satan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a 
living part of heaven along with her and helmeted herself with it now small fowls 
flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf a sullen white surf beat against its steep 
sides then all collapsed and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it 
rolled five thousand years ago epilogue i only am escaped alone to tell job the 
done why then here does any one step forth one did survive the wreck it 
so chanced that after the disappearance i was he whom the fates ordained to take 
the place of bowsman when that bowsman assumed the vacant post the same who when 
on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat 
was dropped astern so floating on the margin of the ensuing scene and in full 
sight of it when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me i was 
then but slowly drawn towards the closing vortex when i reached it it had subsided 
to a creamy pool round and round then and ever contracting towards the button like 
black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle like another ixion i did 
revolve till gaining that vital centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberated by 
reason of its cunning spring and owing to its great buoyancy rising with great force 
the coffin life buoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over and floated by my 
side buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day and night i floated 
on a soft and dirgelike main the unharming sharks they glided by as if with

1805 chapter i prince so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the 
buonapartes but i warn you if you tell me that this means war if you 
still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that really believe he is 
will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend 
no longer my slave as you call yourself but how do you do i see 
i have frightened down and tell me all the news it was in july 1805 
and the speaker was the well known anna pávlovna schérer maid of honor and favorite 
of the empress márya fëdorovna with these words she greeted prince vasíli kurágin a man 
of high rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her reception anna 
pávlovna had had a cough for some days she was as she said suffering from 
la grippe grippe being then a new word in st petersburg used only by the 
elite all her invitations without exception written in french and delivered by a scarlet liveried 
footman that morning ran as follows you have nothing better to do count or prince 
and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too 
terrible i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and schérer what 
a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception he 
had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars 
on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in that 
refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and with the gentle 
patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and 
at court he went up to anna pávlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his 
bald scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofa of all dear 
friend tell me how you are set your mind at rest said he without altering 
his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could 
be discerned one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like 
these if one has any feeling said anna pávlovna are staying the whole evening i 
hope the fete at the english today is wednesday i must put in an appearance 
there said the prince daughter is coming for me to take me there thought fete 
had been canceled i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome they had 
known that you wished it the entertainment would have been put off said the prince 
who like a wound up clock by force of habit said things he did not 
even wish to be believed tease well and what has been decided about dispatch you 
know everything can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless tone 
has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats and i believe 
that we are ready to burn ours prince vasíli always spoke languidly like an actor 
repeating a stale part anna pávlovna schérer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed 
with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes 
even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to 
disappoint the expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it did 
not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled 
child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor 
considered it necessary to correct in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna 
pávlovna burst out speak to me of austria perhaps i understand things but austria never 
has wished and does not wish for war she is betraying us russia alone must 
save europe our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it 
that is the one thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has 
to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that 
god will not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of 
revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and 
villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just one whom i ask you 
can we rely on england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the 
emperor loftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and 
still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer did novosíltsev get none the 
english have not understood and cannot understand the self abnegation of our emperor who wants 
nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they promised 
nothing and what little they have promised they will not perform prussia has always declared 
that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe is powerless before him and i believe 
a word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian neutrality is just a 
trap i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch 
he will save europe she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity think said the 
prince with a smile if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you 
would have captured the king of consent by assault you are so eloquent will you 
give me a cup of tea a moment à propos she added becoming calm again 
am expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is connected with 
the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best french families he is one of 
the genuine émigrés the good ones and also the abbé morio do you know that 
profound thinker he has been received by the emperor had you heard shall be delighted 
to meet them said the prince tell me he added with studied carelessness as if 
it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask 
was the chief motive of his visit it true that the dowager empress wants baron 
funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a 
poor creature prince vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son but others were 
trying through the dowager empress márya fëdorovna to secure it for the baron anna pávlovna 
almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right 
to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with funke has been recommended to 
the dowager empress by her sister was all she said in a dry and mournful 
tone as she named the empress anna face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and 
sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her 
illustrious patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup and 
again her face clouded over with sadness the prince was silent and looked indifferent but 
with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pávlovna wished both 
to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended 
to the empress and at the same time to console him so she said about 
your family do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured 
by her they say she is amazingly beautiful the prince bowed to signify his respect 
and gratitude often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince 
and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were 
ended and the time had come for intimate often think how unfairly sometimes the joys 
of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i speak 
of anatole your youngest i like him she added in a tone admitting of no 
rejoinder and raising her eyebrows such charming children and really you appreciate them less than 
anyone and so you deserve to have them and she smiled her ecstatic smile help 
it said the prince would have said i lack the bump of paternity joke i 
mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i am dissatisfied with 
your younger son between and her face assumed its melancholy expression was mentioned at her 
and you were pitied the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting 
a reply he frowned would you have me do he said at last know i 
did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools 
hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that is 
the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way more natural and 
animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly 
coarse and unpleasant why are children born to such men as you if you were 
not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pávlovna 
looking up pensively am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that 
my children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to 
bear that is how i explain it to myself it be helped he said no 
more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture anna pávlovna meditated you 
never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she asked say old maids have a 
mania for matchmaking and though i feel that weakness in myself as yet i know 
a little person who is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of 
yours princess mary bolkónskaya prince vasíli did not reply though with the quickness of memory 
and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the 
head that he was considering this information you know he said at last evidently unable 
to check the sad current of his thoughts anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles 
a year and he went on after a pause will it be in five years 
if he goes on like this presently he added what we fathers have to put 
up with is this princess of yours rich father is very rich and stingy he 
lives in the country he is the well known prince bolkónski who had to retire 
from the army under the late emperor and was nicknamed king of prussia he is 
very clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has 
a brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately he is an 
aide de camp of and will be here tonight dear annette said the prince suddenly 
taking anna hand and for some reason drawing it downwards that affair for me and 
i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe with an f as a village 
elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich and of good family and 
all i want and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised 
the maid of hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro 
as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction said anna pávlovna reflecting 
speak to lise young wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged 
it shall be on your behalf that start my apprenticeship as old maid chapter ii 
anna drawing room was gradually filling the highest petersburg society was assembled there people differing 
widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged 
prince daughter the beautiful hélène came to take her father to the entertainment she wore 
a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor the youthful little princess bolkónskaya 
known as la femme la plus séduisante de pétersbourg was also there she had been 
married during the previous winter and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings 
but only to small receptions prince son hippolyte had come with mortemart whom he introduced 
the abbé morio and many others had also come the most fascinating woman in petersburg 
to each new arrival anna pávlovna said have not yet seen my aunt or do 
not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old 
lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come sailing in from 
another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and slowly turning her eyes 
from the visitor to her aunt anna pávlovna mentioned each name and then left them 
each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them 
knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them cared about 
anna pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval the aunt 
spoke to each of them in the same words about their health and her own 
and the health of her majesty thank god was better today and each visitor though 
politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a sense of relief at 
having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening the 
young princess bolkónskaya had brought some work in a gold embroidered velvet bag her pretty 
little upper lip on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible was too short 
for her teeth but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when 
she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the case 
with a thoroughly attractive woman her shortness of her upper lip and her half open 
to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight 
of this pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life 
and health and carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young ones 
who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a little 
while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life and health 
all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile and the 
constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a specially amiable mood 
that day the little princess went round the table with quick short swaying steps her 
workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa 
near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself 
and to all around her have brought my work said she in french displaying her 
bag and addressing all present annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick 
on me she added turning to her hostess wrote that it was to be quite 
a small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and she spread out 
her arms to show her short waisted lace trimmed dainty gray dress girdled with a 
broad ribbon just below the breast tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone 
else replied anna pávlovna know said the princess in the same tone of voice and 
still in french turning to a general husband is deserting me he is going to 
get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she added addressing prince 
vasíli and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter the 
beautiful hélène a delightful woman this little princess is said prince vasíli to anna pávlovna 
one of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with close cropped 
hair spectacles the light colored breeches fashionable at that time a very high ruffle and 
a brown dress coat this stout young man was an illegitimate son of count bezúkhov 
a well known grandee of time who now lay dying in moscow the young man 
had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only just 
returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his first appearance in 
society anna pávlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in 
her drawing room but in spite of this lowest grade greeting a look of anxiety 
and fear as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place 
came over her face when she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger 
than the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the 
clever though shy but observant and natural expression which distinguished him from everyone else in 
that drawing room is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a 
poor invalid said anna pávlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted 
him to her pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as if in 
search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess 
with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance anna alarm was justified for pierre 
turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her health anna 
pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words you know the abbé morio he is 
a most interesting man i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it 
is very interesting but hardly feasible think so rejoined anna pávlovna in order to say 
something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now committed 
a reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady before she had finished 
speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get 
away with his head bent and his big feet spread apart he began explaining his 
reasons for thinking the plan chimerical will talk of it later said anna pávlovna with 
a smile and having got rid of this young man who did not know how 
to behave she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready 
to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag as the foreman 
of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes round and 
notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more 
noise than it should and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper 
motion so anna pávlovna moved about her drawing room approaching now a silent now a 
too noisy group and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in 
steady proper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident 
she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round mortemart to 
listen to what was being said there and again when he passed to another group 
whose center was the abbé pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna 
was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all the intellectual lights 
of petersburg were gathered there and like a child in a toyshop did not know 
which way to look afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard 
seeing the self confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was 
always expecting to hear something very profound at last he came up to morio here 
the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own 
views as young people are fond of doing chapter iii anna reception was in full 
swing the spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the 
aunt beside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn face was 
rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company had settled into three 
groups one chiefly masculine had formed round the abbé another of young people was grouped 
round the beautiful princess hélène prince daughter and the little princess bolkónskaya very pretty and 
rosy though rather too plump for her age the third group was gathered round mortemart 
and anna pávlovna the vicomte was a nice looking young man with soft features and 
polished manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself 
at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself anna pávlovna was obviously 
serving him up as a treat to her guests as a clever maître serves up 
as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen 
it in the kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pávlovna served up to 
her guests first the vicomte and then the abbé as peculiarly choice morsels the group 
about mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the duc the vicomte said that the 
duc had perished by his own magnanimity and that there were particular reasons for hatred 
of him yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna pávlovna with a 
pleasant feeling that there was something à la louis xv in the sound of that 
sentence nous çela vicomte the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness 
to comply anna pávlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone to listen to his 
tale vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pávlovna to one of the guests vicomte 
is a wonderful raconteur said she to another evidently he belongs to the best society 
said she to a third and the vicomte was served up to the company in 
the choicest and most advantageous style like a well garnished joint of roast beef on 
a hot dish the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile 
over here hélène dear said anna pávlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting 
some way off the center of another group the princess smiled she rose with the 
same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the smile of a perfectly beautiful 
woman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy with 
a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparkling diamonds she passed between the men 
who made way for her not looking at any of them but smiling on all 
as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders 
back and in the fashion of those days were very much she seemed to bring 
the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward anna pávlovna hélène was 
so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry but on 
the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty she 
seemed to wish but to be unable to diminish its effect lovely said everyone who 
saw her and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled 
by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with 
her unchanging smile i doubt my ability before such an audience said he smilingly inclining 
his head the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered 
a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time the story was being told she 
sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round arm altered in shape by its pressure 
on the table now at her still more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a 
diamond necklace from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever 
the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pávlovna at once adopted just the 
expression she saw on the maid of face and again relapsed into her radiant smile 
the little princess had also left the tea table and followed hélène a moment get 
my work now then what are you thinking of she went on turning to prince 
hippolyte me my workbag there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking 
merrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat i 
am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin she took up her 
work prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle and moving a chair close 
to hers seated himself beside her le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance 
to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of this 
resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features were like his but while in her case 
everything was lit up by a joyous self satisfied youthful and constant smile of animation 
and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrary was 
dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self confidence while his body was 
thin and weak his eyes nose and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied 
grimace and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions not going to be 
a ghost story said he sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette 
as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak no my dear fellow 
said the astonished narrator shrugging his shoulders i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in 
a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he 
had uttered them he spoke with such self confidence that his hearers could not be 
sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he was dressed in 
a dark green dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayée 
as he called it shoes and silk stockings the vicomte told his tale very neatly 
it was an anecdote then current to the effect that the duc had gone secretly 
to paris to visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came upon bonaparte who 
also enjoyed the famous favors and that in his presence napoleon happened to fall into 
one of the fainting fits to which he was subject and was thus at the 
mercy the latter spared him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by death the story 
was very pretty and interesting especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one 
another and the ladies looked agitated said anna pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the 
little princess whispered the little princess sticking the needle into her work as if to 
testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with 
it the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue but just 
then anna pávlovna who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so 
alarmed her noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé so 
she hurried to the rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé 
about the balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the young simple minded 
eagerness was explaining his pet theory both were talking and listening too eagerly and too 
naturally which was why anna pávlovna disapproved means are the balance of power in europe 
and the rights of the people the abbé was saying is only necessary for one 
powerful nation like as she is said to place herself disinterestedly at the head of 
an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of europe 
and it would save the world how are you to get that balance pierre was 
beginning at that moment anna pávlovna came up and looking severely at pierre asked the 
italian how he stood russian climate the face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected 
sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversing with women am so enchanted by the 
brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society more especially of the feminine society 
in which i have had the honor of being received that i have not yet 
had time to think of the climate said he not letting the abbé and pierre 
escape anna pávlovna the more conveniently to keep them under observation brought them into the 
larger circle chapter iv just then another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew bolkónski 
the little husband he was a very handsome young man of medium height with firm 
clearcut features everything about him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured step 
offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife it was evident that he 
not only knew everyone in the drawing room but had found them to be so 
tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them and among all 
these faces that he found so tedious none seemed to bore him so much as 
that of his pretty wife he turned away from her with a grimace that distorted 
his handsome face kissed anna hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company 
are off to the war prince said anna pávlovna kutúzov said bolkónski speaking french and 
stressing the last syllable of the name like a frenchman been pleased to take me 
as an aide de camp lise your wife will go to the country you not 
ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife said his wife addressing her husband in 
the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men vicomte has been telling 
us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte prince andrew screwed up his eyes 
and turned away pierre who from the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched 
him with glad affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he looked 
round prince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm but 
when he saw beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile now 
so you too are in the great world said he to pierre knew you would 
be here replied pierre will come to supper with you may i he added in 
a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story 
impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressing hand to show that there was no need 
to ask the question he wished to say something more but at that moment prince 
vasíli and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to 
let them pass must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasíli to the frenchman holding 
him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising unfortunate fete 
at the deprives me of a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you i am 
very sorry to leave your enchanting party said he turning to anna pávlovna his daughter 
princess hélène passed between the chairs lightly holding up the folds of her dress and 
the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with 
rapturous almost frightened eyes as she passed him lovely said prince andrew said pierre in 
passing prince vasíli seized hand and said to anna pávlovna this bear for me he 
has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time i 
have seen him in society nothing is so necessary for a young man as the 
society of clever women anna pávlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she 
knew his father to be a connection of prince the elderly lady who had been 
sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasíli in the anteroom all 
the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear worn face 
and it now expressed only anxiety and fear about my son borís prince said she 
hurrying after him into the anteroom remain any longer in petersburg tell me what news 
i may take back to my poor boy although prince vasíli listened reluctantly and not 
very politely to the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an ingratiating 
and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go away would it 
cost you to say a word to the emperor and then he would be transferred 
to the guards at once said she me princess i am ready to do all 
i can answered prince vasíli it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i 
should advise you to appeal to rumyántsev through prince golítsyn that would be the best 
way the elderly lady was a princess drubetskáya belonging to one of the best families 
in russia but she was poor and having long been out of society had lost 
her former influential connections she had now come to petersburg to procure an appointment in 
the guards for her only son it was in fact solely to meet prince vasíli 
that she had obtained an invitation to anna reception and had sat listening to the 
story prince words frightened her an embittered look clouded her once handsome face but only 
for a moment then she smiled again and clutched prince arm more tightly to me 
prince said she have never yet asked you for anything and i never will again 
nor have i ever reminded you of my friendship for you but now i entreat 
you for sake to do this for my i shall always regard you as a 
benefactor she added hurriedly be angry but promise i have asked golítsyn and he has 
refused be the kindhearted man you always were she said trying to smile though tears 
were in her eyes we shall be late said princess hélène turning her beautiful head 
and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door influence 
in society however is a capital which has to be economized if it is to 
last prince vasíli knew this and having once realized that if he asked on behalf 
of all who begged of him he would soon be unable to ask for himself 
he became chary of using his influence but in princess case he felt after her 
second appeal something like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was quite 
true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career 
moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those having once 
made up their minds will not rest until they have gained their end and are 
prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour and 
even to make scenes this last consideration moved him dear anna mikháylovna said he with 
his usual familiarity and weariness of tone is almost impossible for me to do what 
you ask but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your memory 
i will do the son shall be transferred to the guards here is my hand 
on it are you satisfied dear benefactor this is what i expected from knew your 
kindness he turned to go a word when he has been transferred to the guards 
she faltered are on good terms with michael ilariónovich kutúzov recommend borís to him as 
adjutant then i shall be at rest and then prince vasíli smiled i promise that 
you know how kutúzov is pestered since his appointment as commander in chief he told 
me himself that all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons 
as adjutants but do promise i let you go my dear benefactor said his beautiful 
daughter in the same tone as before shall be late au revoir good by you 
hear her tomorrow you will speak to the emperor but about kutúzov i promise promise 
do promise vasíli cried anna mikháylovna as he went with the smile of a coquettish 
girl which at one time probably came naturally to her but was now very ill 
suited to her careworn face apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of 
habit employed all the old feminine arts but as soon as the prince had gone 
her face resumed its former cold artificial expression she returned to the group where the 
vicomte was still talking and again pretended to listen while waiting till it would be 
time to leave her task was accomplished chapter v what do you think of this 
latest comedy the coronation at milan asked anna pávlovna of the comedy of the people 
of genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte and monsieur buonaparte sitting on 
a throne and granting the petitions of the nations adorable it is enough to make 
head whirl it is as if the whole world had gone crazy prince andrew looked 
anna pávlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile me la donne gare à 
qui la touche they say he was very fine when he said that he remarked 
repeating the words in italian mi dato guai a chi la tocchi god has given 
it to me let him who touches it beware hope this will prove the last 
drop that will make the glass run over anna pávlovna continued sovereigns will not be 
able to endure this man who is a menace to everything sovereigns i do not 
speak of russia said the vicomte polite but hopeless sovereigns madame what have they done 
for louis xvii for the queen or for madame elizabeth nothing and he became more 
animated believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the bourbon cause 
the sovereigns why they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper and sighing disdainfully he 
again changed his position prince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some 
time through his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess and having asked 
for a needle began tracing the condé coat of arms on the table he explained 
this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do 
it de gueules engrêlé de gueules condé said he the princess listened smiling buonaparte remains 
on the throne of france a year longer the vicomte continued with the air of 
a man who in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else 
does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts will have 
gone too far by intrigues violence exile and executions french mean good french have been 
forever destroyed and then he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished 
to make a remark for the conversation interested him but anna pávlovna who had him 
under observation interrupted emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference 
of hers to the imperial family declared that he will leave it to the french 
people themselves to choose their own form of government and i believe that once free 
from the usurper the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its 
rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant is doubtful said 
prince andrew le vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far i 
think it will be difficult to return to the old regime what i have heard 
said pierre blushing and breaking into the conversation all the aristocracy has already gone over 
to side is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without looking at pierre 
the present time it is difficult to know the real state of french public opinion 
has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile it was evident that he 
did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him though without looking 
at him showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it prince 
andrew continued after a short silence again quoting words opened my antechambers and they crowded 
in i do not know how far he was justified in saying so in the 
least replied the vicomte the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to 
regard him as a hero if to some people he went on turning to anna 
pávlovna ever was a hero after the murder of the duc there was one martyr 
more in heaven and one hero less on earth before anna pávlovna and the others 
had time to smile their appreciation of the epigram pierre again broke into the conversation 
and though anna pávlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate she was unable to 
stop him execution of the duc declared monsieur pierre a political necessity and it seems 
to me that napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself 
the whole responsibility of that deed mon dieu muttered anna pávlovna in a terrified whisper 
monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul said the little princess 
smiling and drawing her work nearer to her oh exclaimed several voices said prince hippolyte 
in english and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand the vicomte 
merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued 
say so he continued desperately the bourbons fled from the revolution leaving the people to 
anarchy and napoleon alone understood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general 
good he could not stop short for the sake of one life you come over 
to the other table suggested anna pávlovna but pierre continued his speech without heeding her 
cried he becoming more and more eager is great because he rose superior to the 
revolution suppressed its abuses preserved all that was good in of citizenship and freedom of 
speech and of the only for that reason did he obtain power if having obtained 
power without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the 
rightful king i should have called him a great man remarked the vicomte could not 
do that the people only gave him power that he might rid them of the 
bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man the revolution was a 
grand thing continued monsieur pierre betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth 
and his wish to express all that was in his mind revolution and regicide a 
grand thing well after that but you come to this other table repeated anna pávlovna 
contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant smile am not speaking of regicide i 
am speaking about ideas ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an ironical voice 
were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most important what is important 
are the rights of man emancipation from prejudices and equality of citizenship and all these 
ideas napoleon has retained in full force and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if 
at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were sounding 
words which have long been discredited who does not love liberty and equality even our 
saviour preached liberty and equality have people since the revolution become happier on the contrary 
we wanted liberty but buonaparte has destroyed it prince andrew kept looking with an amused 
smile from pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess in the 
first moment of outburst anna pávlovna despite her social experience was horror struck but when 
she saw that sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that 
it was impossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in 
a vigorous attack on the orator my dear monsieur pierre said she do you explain 
the fact of a great man executing a even an ordinary man innocent and untried 
should like said the vicomte ask how monsieur explains the 18th brumaire was not that 
an imposture it was a swindle and not at all like the conduct of a 
great man the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said the little princess 
shrugging her shoulders a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolyte pierre not 
knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled his smile was unlike the 
half smile of other people when he smiled his grave even rather gloomy look was 
instantaneously replaced by childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to ask forgiveness the 
vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young jacobin 
was not so terrible as his words suggested all were silent do you expect him 
to answer you all at once said prince andrew in the actions of a statesman 
one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person as a general and 
as an emperor so it seems to me yes of course pierre chimed in pleased 
at the arrival of this reinforcement must admit continued prince andrew napoleon as a man 
was great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where he 
gave his hand to the plague stricken but but there are other acts which it 
is difficult to justify prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness 
of remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to 
go suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend and asking them 
all to be seated began was told a charming moscow story today and must treat 
you to it excuse me must tell it in russian or the point will be 
lost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian as a frenchman 
would speak after spending about a year in russia everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly 
did he demand their attention to his story is in moscow a lady une dame 
and she is very stingy she must have two footmen behind her carriage and very 
big ones that was her taste and she had a maid also big she said 
here prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty said oh yes she said 
to the maid on a livery get up behind the carriage and come with me 
while i make some calls here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before 
his audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several persons among them the 
elderly lady and anna pávlovna did however smile went suddenly there was a great wind 
the girl lost her hat and her long hair came down here he could contain 
himself no longer and went on between gasps of laughter the whole world knew and 
so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told it or why 
it had to be told in russian still anna pávlovna and the others appreciated prince 
social tact in so agreeably ending unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote the conversation 
broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls about theatricals and 
who would meet whom and when and where chapter vi having thanked anna pávlovna for 
her charming soiree the guests began to take their leave pierre was ungainly stout about 
the average height broad with huge red hands he did not know as the saying 
is how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one that 
is how to say something particularly agreeable before going away besides this he was absent 
minded when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the three 
cornered hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general asked him to 
restore it all his absent mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in 
it was however redeemed by his kindly simple and modest expression anna pávlovna turned toward 
him and with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion nodded and said 
hope to see you again but i also hope you will change your opinions my 
dear monsieur pierre when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but 
again everybody saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps are opinions but you see 
what a capital good natured fellow i am and everyone including anna pávlovna felt this 
prince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to the footman 
who was helping him on with his cloak listened indifferently to his chatter with prince 
hippolyte who had also come into the hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty 
pregnant princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass in annette or you will 
catch cold said the little princess taking leave of anna pávlovna is settled she added 
in a low voice anna pávlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the 
match she contemplated between anatole and the little sister in law rely on you my 
dear said anna pávlovna also in a low tone to her and let me know 
how her father looks at the matter au revoir she left the hall prince hippolyte 
approached the little princess and bending his face close to her began to whisper something 
two footmen the and his own stood holding a shawl and a cloak waiting for 
the conversation to finish they listened to the french sentences which to them were meaningless 
with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess 
as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh am very glad i did not 
go to the said prince hippolyte it has been a delightful evening has it not 
delightful say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing up her downy 
little lip the pretty women in society will be there all for you will not 
be there not all said prince hippolyte smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the 
footman whom he even pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess either from 
awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after the shawl had been adjusted 
he kept his arm around her for a long time as though embracing her still 
smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her husband prince eyes were closed 
so weary and sleepy did he seem you ready he asked his wife looking past 
her prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashion reached to 
his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porch following the princess 
whom a footman was helping into the carriage au revoir cried he stumbling with his 
tongue as well as with his feet the princess picking up her dress was taking 
her seat in the dark carriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte under 
pretense of helping was in way me sir said prince andrew in russian in a 
cold disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path am expecting you pierre 
said the same voice but gently and affectionately the postilion started the carriage wheels rattled 
prince hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom 
he had promised to take home mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself beside 
hippolyte in the carriage little princess is very nice very nice indeed quite french and 
he kissed the tips of his fingers hippolyte burst out laughing you know you are 
a terrible chap for all your innocent airs continued the vicomte pity the poor husband 
that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch hippolyte spluttered again and 
amid his laughter said you were saying that the russian ladies are not equal to 
the french one has to know how to deal with them pierre reaching the house 
first went into prince study like one quite at home and from habit immediately lay 
down on the sofa took from the shelf the first book that came to his 
hand it was commentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middle 
have you done to mlle schérer she will be quite ill now said prince andrew 
as he entered the study rubbing his small white hands pierre turned his whole body 
making the sofa creak he lifted his eager face to prince andrew smiled and waved 
his hand abbé is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the 
right light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible do not know how to express 
it not by a balance of political power it was evident that prince andrew was 
not interested in such abstract conversation everywhere say all one thinks mon cher well have 
you at last decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or a 
diplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silence pierre sat up on the sofa with 
his legs tucked under him i yet know i like either the one or the 
other you must decide on something your father expects it pierre at the age of 
ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor and had remained away till 
he was twenty when he returned to moscow his father dismissed the abbé and said 
to the young man go to petersburg look round and choose your profession i will 
agree to anything here is a letter to prince vasíli and here is money write 
to me all about it and i will help you in everything pierre had already 
been choosing a career for three months and had not decided on anything it was 
about this choice that prince andrew was speaking pierre rubbed his forehead he must be 
a freemason said he referring to the abbé whom he had met that evening is 
all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him us talk business have you been to the 
horse guards i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted 
to tell you there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war 
for freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army 
but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is not 
right prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at childish words he put on the air 
of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense but it would in 
fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one prince andrew gave 
to this naïve question no one fought except on his own conviction there would be 
no wars he said that would be splendid said pierre prince andrew smiled ironically likely 
it would be splendid but it will never come about why are you going to 
the war asked pierre for i know i must besides that i am going he 
paused am going because the life i am leading here does not suit me chapter 
vii the rustle of a dress was heard in the next room prince andrew shook 
himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it had had in 
anna drawing room pierre removed his feet from the sofa the princess came in she 
had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other 
prince andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her is it she began as 
usual in french settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair is it annette 
never got married how stupid you men all are not to have married her excuse 
me for saying so but you have no sense about women what an argumentative fellow 
you are monsieur pierre i am still arguing with your husband i understand why he 
wants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess with none of the 
embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women the princess 
started evidently words touched her to the quick that is just what i tell him 
said she understand it i in the least understand why men live without wars how 
is it that we women want anything of the kind need it now you shall 
judge between us i always tell him here he is aide de camp a most 
brilliant position he is so well known so much appreciated by everyone the other day 
at the i heard a lady asking that the famous prince andrew i did indeed 
she laughed is so well received everywhere he might easily become aide de camp to 
the emperor you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously annette and i were 
speaking of how to arrange it what do you think pierre looked at his friend 
and noticing that he did not like the conversation gave no reply are you starting 
he asked speak of his going i hear it spoken of said the princess in 
the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing 
room and which was so plainly ill suited to the family circle of which pierre 
was almost a member when i remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken 
off and then you know andré she looked significantly at her husband afraid afraid she 
whispered and a shudder ran down her back her husband looked at her as if 
surprised to notice that someone besides pierre and himself was in the room and addressed 
her in a tone of frigid politeness is it you are afraid of lise i 
understand said he what egotists men all are all all egotists just for a whim 
of his own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alone 
in the country my father and sister remember said prince andrew gently all the same 
without my friends and he expects me not to be afraid her tone was now 
querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a joyful but an animal squirrel 
like expression she paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy 
before pierre though the gist of the matter lay in that still understand what you 
are afraid of said prince andrew slowly not taking his eyes off his wife the 
princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despair andrew i must say 
you have changed oh how you have doctor tells you to go to bed earlier 
said prince andrew had better go the princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy 
lip quivered prince andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the room pierre looked 
over his spectacles with naïve surprise now at him and now at her moved as 
if about to rise too but changed his mind should i mind monsieur pierre being 
here exclaimed the little princess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a 
tearful grimace have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have changed so to 
me what have i done to you you are going to the war and have 
no pity for me why is it was all prince andrew said but that one 
word expressed an entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herself regret 
her words but she went on hurriedly treat me like an invalid or a child 
i see it all did you behave like that six months ago i beg you 
to desist said prince andrew still more emphatically pierre who had been growing more and 
more agitated as he listened to all this rose and approached the princess he seemed 
unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself yourself princess 
it seems so to you because i assure you i myself have experienced and so 
because no excuse me an outsider is out of place here no distress yourself good 
by prince andrew caught him by the hand wait pierre the princess is too kind 
to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you he 
thinks only of himself muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears said prince andrew 
dryly raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted suddenly the 
angry squirrel like expression of the pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look 
of fear her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her face and her own assumed the 
timid deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail 
dieu mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one hand she went up 
to her husband and kissed him on the forehead night lise said he rising and 
courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger chapter viii the 
friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierre continually glanced at prince andrew prince 
andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand us go and have supper he said 
with a sigh going to the door they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious 
dining room everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore that 
imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married halfway through supper prince 
andrew leaned his elbows on the table and with a look of nervous agitation such 
as pierre had never before seen on his face began to one who has long 
had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out never marry my dear 
fellow my advice never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done 
all you are capable of and until you have ceased to love the woman of 
your choice and have seen her plainly as she is or else you will make 
a cruel and irrevocable mistake marry when you are old and good for all that 
is good and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on 
trifles yes yes yes look at me with such surprise if you marry expecting anything 
from yourself in the future you will feel at every step that for you all 
is ended all is closed except the drawing room where you will be ranged side 
by side with a court lackey and an idiot but the good and he waved 
his arm pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and the 
good natured expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend in amazement wife continued 
prince andrew an excellent woman one of those rare women with whom a honor is 
safe but o god what would i not give now to be unmarried you are 
the first and only one to whom i mention this because i like you as 
he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkónski who had lolled 
in anna easy chairs and with half closed eyes had uttered french phrases between his 
teeth every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes 
in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light it 
was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more impassioned he 
became in these moments of almost morbid irritation understand why i say this he continued 
it is the whole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career said 
he though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte bonaparte when he worked went step by step 
toward his goal he was free he had nothing but his aim to consider and 
he reached it but tie yourself up with a woman and like a chained convict 
you lose all freedom and all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you 
down and torments you with regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and are the enchanted 
circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the war the greatest war 
there ever was and i know nothing and am fit for nothing i am very 
amiable and have a caustic wit continued prince andrew at anna they listen to me 
and that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you 
only knew what those society women are and women in general my father is right 
selfish vain stupid trivial in what women are when you see them in their true 
colors when you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in 
them but nothing nothing nothing no marry my dear fellow marry concluded prince andrew seems 
funny to me said pierre you you should consider yourself incapable and your life a 
spoiled life you have everything before you everything and you he did not finish his 
sentence but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much 
he expected of him in the future can he talk like that thought pierre he 
considered his friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree 
just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be best described as strength of 
will pierre was always astonished at prince calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memory 
his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and had an opinion about everything 
but above all at his capacity for work and study and if pierre was often 
struck by lack of capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly addicted 
he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength even 
in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise and commendation are essential 
just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly part is played 
out said prince andrew the use of talking about me let us talk about you 
he added after a silence smiling at his reassuring thoughts that smile was immediately reflected 
on face what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxing into 
a careless merry smile am i an illegitimate son he suddenly blushed crimson and it 
was plain that he had made a great effort to say this a name and 
without means and it really but he did not say what was the present i 
am free and am all right only i the least idea what i am to 
do i wanted to consult you seriously prince andrew looked kindly at him yet his 
and affectionate as it a sense of his own superiority am fond of you especially 
as you are the one live man among our whole set yes all right choose 
what you will all the same be all right anywhere but look here give up 
visiting those kurágins and leading that sort of life it suits you so this debauchery 
dissipation and the rest of it would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging 
his shoulders my dear fellow women understand it replied prince andrew who are comme il 
faut a different matter but the set of women and i understand pierre was staying 
at prince vasíli and sharing the dissipated life of his son anatole the son whom 
they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince sister you know said pierre 
as if suddenly struck by a happy thought i have long been thinking of it 
leading such a life i decide or think properly about anything head aches and one 
spends all money he asked me for tonight but i go give me your word 
of honor not to go my honor chapter ix it was past one when pierre 
left his friend it was a cloudless northern summer night pierre took an open cab 
intending to drive straight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more 
he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light 
enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like 
morning or evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole kurágin was expecting 
the usual set for cards that evening after which there was generally a drinking bout 
finishing with visits of a kind pierre was very fond of should like to go 
to thought he but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go 
there then as happens to people of weak character he desired so passionately once more 
to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go the 
thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to prince andrew was of no account 
because before he gave it he had already promised prince anatole to come to his 
gathering thought he such of are conventional things with no definite meaning especially if one 
considers that by tomorrow one may be dead or something so extraordinary may happen to 
one that honor and dishonor will be all the same pierre often indulged in reflections 
of this sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions he went to reaching the large 
house near the horse barracks in which anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended 
the stairs and went in at the open door there was no one in the 
anteroom empty bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of alcohol 
and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance cards and supper were over but 
the visitors had not yet dispersed pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first 
room in which were the remains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him 
was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses from the third room 
came sounds of laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and 
general commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window 
three others were romping with a young bear one pulling him by the chain and 
trying to set him at the others bet a hundred on stevens shouted one no 
holding on cried another bet on dólokhov cried a third you part our hands leave 
bruin alone a bet on one draught or he loses shouted a fourth bring a 
bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the 
group without a coat and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front a bit 
you fellows here is pétya good man cried he addressing pierre another voice from a 
man of medium height with clear blue eyes particularly striking among all these drunken voices 
by its sober ring cried from the window here part the bets this was dólokhov 
an officer of the semënov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist who was living with 
anatole pierre smiled looking about him merrily understand it all about a bit he is 
not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole and taking a glass from the table 
he went up to pierre of all you must drink pierre drank one glass after 
another looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round 
the window and listening to their chatter anatole kept on refilling glass while explaining that 
dólokhov was betting with stevens an english naval officer that he would drink a bottle 
of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs 
hanging out on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the last glass 
i let you go i said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to 
the window dólokhov was holding the hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of 
the bet addressing himself particularly to anatole and pierre dólokhov was of medium height with 
curly hair and light blue eyes he was about twenty five like all infantry officers 
he wore no mustache so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face 
was clearly seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middle of 
the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one 
and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth 
this together with the resolute insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made 
it impossible not to notice his face dólokhov was a man of small means and 
no connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles dólokhov lived with him 
and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them including anatole 
himself respected him more than they did anatole dólokhov could play all games and nearly 
always won however much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness both kurágin and dólokhov 
were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg the bottle of 
rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill 
was being forced out by two footmen who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the 
directions and shouts of the gentlemen around anatole with his swaggering air strode up to 
the window he wanted to smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the 
frame but could not move it he smashed a pane have a try hercules said 
he turning to pierre pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out 
with a crash it right out or think holding on said dólokhov the englishman bragging 
eh is it all right said anatole rate said pierre looking at dólokhov who with 
a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window from which the light 
of the sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible dólokhov the 
bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window sill cried he standing 
there and addressing those in the room all were silent bet fifty spoke french that 
the englishman might understand him but he did not speak it very bet fifty imperials 
or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressing the englishman fifty 
replied the latter right fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle of rum 
without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this he stooped and 
pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window without holding on to anything is that 
right right said the englishman anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one 
of the buttons of his coat and looking down at englishman was repeating the terms 
of the wager to him in english cried dólokhov hammering with the bottle on the 
window sill to attract attention a bit kurágin listen if anyone else does the same 
i will pay him a hundred imperials do you understand the englishman nodded but gave 
no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not anatole did not release 
him and though he kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translating 
words into english a thin young lad an hussar of the life guards who had 
been losing that evening climbed on the window sill leaned over and looked down oh 
oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement up 
cried dólokhov pushing him away from the window the lad jumped awkwardly back into the 
room tripping over his spurs placing the bottle on the window sill where he could 
reach it easily dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs 
pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on his seat lowered his 
hands moved a little to the right and then to the left and took up 
the bottle anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill though it 
was already quite light back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit 
up from both sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in front pierre stood 
smiling but silent one man older than the others present suddenly pushed forward with a 
scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of shirt say this is folly 
be killed said this more sensible man anatole stopped him touch him startle him and 
then be killed eh what then eh dólokhov turned round and again holding on with 
both hands arranged himself on his seat anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the 
words separately through his thin compressed lips will throw him down there now then saying 
this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle and lifted it to 
his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand to balance himself one 
of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that 
position without taking his eyes from the window and from back anatole stood erect with 
staring eyes the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the man who had 
wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself 
on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face from which 
a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear all 
were still pierre took his hands from his eyes dólokhov still sat in the same 
position only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt 
collar and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with 
the effort the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting 
yet further back is it so long thought pierre it seemed to him that more 
than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dólokhov made a backward movement with his spine 
and his arm trembled nervously this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip 
as he sat on the sloping ledge as he began slipping down his head and 
arm wavered still more with the strain one hand moved as if to clutch the 
window sill but refrained from touching it pierre again covered his eyes and thought he 
would never open them again suddenly he was aware of a stir all around he 
looked up dólokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but radiant face 
empty he threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly dólokhov jumped down 
he smelt strongly of rum done fine fellow a bet for you devil take you 
came from different sides the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the 
money dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak pierre jumped upon the window sill who 
wishes to bet with me do the same thing he suddenly cried without a bet 
there tell them to bring me a bottle do it bring a bottle him do 
it let him do it said dólokhov smiling next have you gone mad no one 
would let you why you go giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices drink 
it have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging the table with a determined and 
drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window they seized him by his 
arms but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying never 
manage him that way said anatole a bit and get round him listen take your 
bet tomorrow but now we are all going to on then cried pierre on and 
take bruin with us and he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted 
it from the ground and began dancing round the room with it chapter x prince 
vasíli kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskáya who had spoken to him 
on behalf of her only son borís on the evening of anna soiree the matter 
was mentioned to the emperor an exception made and borís transferred into the regiment of 
semënov guards with the rank of cornet he received however no appointment to staff despite 
all anna endeavors and entreaties soon after anna reception anna mikháylovna returned to moscow and 
went straight to her rich relations the rostóvs with whom she stayed when in the 
town and where her darling bóry who had only just entered a regiment of the 
line and was being at once transferred to the guards as a cornet had been 
educated from childhood and lived for years at a time the guards had already left 
petersburg on the tenth of august and her son who had remained in moscow for 
his equipment was to join them on the march to radzivílov it was st day 
and the name day of two of the mother and the youngest named nataly ever 
since the morning carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually bringing visitors 
to the countess big house on the povarskáya so well known to all moscow the 
countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors 
who came to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in relays the countess was 
a woman of about forty five with a thin oriental type of face evidently worn 
out with had had twelve a languor of motion and speech resulting from weakness gave 
her a distinguished air which inspired respect princess anna mikháylovna drubetskáya who as a member 
of the household was also seated in the drawing room helped to receive and entertain 
the visitors the young people were in one of the inner rooms not considering it 
necessary to take part in receiving the visitors the count met the guests and saw 
them off inviting them all to dinner am very very grateful to you mon cher 
or called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone dear whether 
they were above or below him in thank you for myself and for our two 
dear ones whose name day we are keeping but mind you come to dinner or 
i shall be offended ma chère on behalf of the whole family i beg you 
to come mon cher these words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation and 
with the same expression on his full cheerful clean shaven face the same firm pressure 
of the hand and the same quick repeated bows as soon as he had seen 
a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing 
room drew a chair toward him or her and jauntily spreading out his legs and 
putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life 
and knows how to live he swayed to and fro with dignity offered surmises about 
the weather or touched on questions of health sometimes in russian and sometimes in very 
bad but self confident french then again like a man weary but unflinching in the 
fulfillment of duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking his scanty gray 
hairs over his bald patch also asked them to dinner sometimes on his way back 
from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble 
dining hall where tables were being set out for eighty people and looking at the 
footmen who were bringing in silver and china moving tables and unfolding damask table linen 
he would call dmítri vasílevich a man of good family and the manager of all 
his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say dmítri see 
that things are all as they should be right the great thing is the serving 
it and with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room lvóvna karágina 
and her daughter announced the gigantic footman in his bass voice entering the drawing room 
the countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her 
portrait on it quite worn out by these callers however see her and no more 
she is so affected ask her in she said to the footman in a sad 
voice as if saying well finish me off a tall stout and proud looking woman 
with a round faced smiling daughter entered the drawing room their dresses rustling countess what 
an age she has been laid up poor child at the ball and countess apráksina 
i was so delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices interrupting one another and 
mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs then one of those 
conversations began which last out until at the first pause the guests rise with a 
rustle of dresses and say am so delighted health and countess apráksina and then again 
rustling pass into the anteroom put on cloaks or mantles and drive away the conversation 
was on the chief topic of the day the illness of the wealthy and celebrated 
beau of day count bezúkhov and about his illegitimate son pierre the one who had 
behaved so improperly at anna reception am so sorry for the poor count said the 
visitor is in such bad health and now this vexation about his son is enough 
to kill him is that asked the countess as if she did not know what 
the visitor alluded to though she had already heard about the cause of count distress 
some fifteen times what comes of a modern education exclaimed the visitor seems that while 
he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked now in 
petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled 
by the police say so replied the countess chose his friends badly interposed anna mikháylovna 
son he and a certain dólokhov have it is said been up to heaven only 
knows what and they have had to suffer for it dólokhov has been degraded to 
the ranks and son sent back to moscow anatole father managed somehow to get his 
affair hushed up but even he was ordered out of petersburg what have they been 
up to asked the countess are regular brigands especially dólokhov replied the visitor is a 
son of márya ivánovna dólokhova such a worthy woman but there just fancy those three 
got hold of a bear somewhere put it in a carriage and set off with 
it to visit some actresses the police tried to interfere and what did the young 
men do they tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the 
bear into the moyka canal and there was the bear swimming about with the policeman 
on his back a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted the 
count dying with laughter how dreadful how can you laugh at it count yet the 
ladies themselves could not help laughing was all they could do to rescue the poor 
man continued the visitor to think it is cyril vladímirovich son who amuses himself in 
this sensible manner and he was said to be so well educated and clever this 
is all that his foreign education has done for him i hope that here in 
moscow no one will receive him in spite of his money they wanted to introduce 
him to me but i quite declined i have my daughters to consider do you 
say this young man is so rich asked the countess turning away from the girls 
who at once assumed an air of inattention children are all illegitimate i think pierre 
also is illegitimate the visitor made a gesture with her hand should think he has 
a score of them princess anna mikháylovna intervened in the conversation evidently wishing to show 
her connections and knowledge of what went on in society fact of the matter is 
said she significantly and also in a half whisper knows count reputation he has lost 
count of his children but this pierre was his favorite handsome the old man still 
was only a year ago remarked the countess have never seen a handsomer man is 
very much altered now said anna mikháylovna as i was saying prince vasíli is the 
next heir through his wife but the count is very fond of pierre looked after 
his education and wrote to the emperor about him so that in the case of 
his he is so ill that he may die at any moment and dr lorrain 
has come from one knows who will inherit his immense fortune pierre or prince vasíli 
forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles i know it all very well for prince 
vasíli told me himself besides cyril vladímirovich is my second cousin also my godfather she 
added as if she attached no importance at all to the fact vasíli arrived in 
moscow yesterday i hear he has come on some inspection business remarked the visitor but 
between ourselves said the princess is a pretext the fact is he has come to 
see count cyril vladímirovich hearing how ill he is do you know my dear that 
was a capital joke said the count and seeing that the elder visitor was not 
listening he turned to the young ladies can just imagine what a funny figure that 
policeman cut and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form 
again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats well 
and in particular drinks well do come and dine with us he said chapter xi 
silence ensued the countess looked at her callers smiling affably but not concealing the fact 
that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave the 
daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother when 
suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to 
the door and the noise of a chair falling over and a girl of thirteen 
hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock darted in and stopped short 
in the middle of the room it was evident that she had not intended her 
flight to bring her so far behind her in the doorway appeared a student with 
a crimson coat collar an officer of the guards a girl of fifteen and a 
plump rosy faced boy in a short jacket the count jumped up and swaying from 
side to side spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who 
had run in here she is he exclaimed laughing pet whose name day it is 
my dear pet chère there is a time for everything said the countess with feigned 
severity spoil her ilyá she added turning to her husband do you do my dear 
i wish you many happy returns of your name day said the visitor a charming 
child she added addressing the mother this black eyed wide mouthed girl not pretty but 
full of childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice with 
black curls tossed backward thin bare arms little legs in lace frilled drawers and feet 
in low just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child 
though the child is not yet a young woman escaping from her father she ran 
to hide her flushed face in the lace of her paying the least attention to 
her severe began to laugh she laughed and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about 
a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock you see my doll 
mimi you see was all natásha managed to utter to her everything seemed funny she 
leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud ringing fit of laughter that 
even the prim visitor could not help joining in then go away and take your 
monstrosity with you said the mother pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness and turning 
to the visitor she added is my youngest girl natásha raising her face for a 
moment from her mantilla glanced up at her through tears of laughter and again hid 
her face the visitor compelled to look on at this family scene thought it necessary 
to take some part in it me my dear said she to natásha mimi a 
relation of yours a daughter i suppose natásha did not like the tone of condescension 
to childish things she did not reply but looked at her seriously meanwhile the younger 
generation borís the officer anna son nicholas the undergraduate the eldest son sónya the fifteen 
year old niece and little pétya his youngest boy had all settled down in the 
drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement 
and mirth that shone in all their faces evidently in the back rooms from which 
they had dashed out so impetuously the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing 
room talk of society scandals the weather and countess apráksina now and then they glanced 
at one another hardly able to suppress their laughter the two young men the student 
and the officer friends from childhood were of the same age and both handsome fellows 
though not alike borís was tall and fair and his calm and handsome face had 
regular delicate features nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression dark hairs 
were already showing on his upper lip and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm 
nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room he evidently tried to find something to 
say but failed borís on the contrary at once found his footing and related quietly 
and humorously how he had known that doll mimi when she was still quite a 
young lady before her nose was broken how she had aged during the five years 
he had known her and how her head had cracked right across the skull having 
said this he glanced at natásha she turned away from him and glanced at her 
younger brother who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter and unable 
to control herself any longer she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast 
as her nimble little feet would carry her borís did not laugh were meaning to 
go out you mamma do you want the carriage he asked his mother with a 
smile yes go and tell them to get it ready she answered returning his smile 
borís quietly left the room and went in search of natásha the plump boy ran 
after them angrily as if vexed that their program had been disturbed chapter xii the 
only young people remaining in the drawing room not counting the young lady visitor and 
the eldest daughter who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like 
a grown up person were nicholas and sónya the niece sónya was a slender little 
brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes thick 
black plaits coiling twice round her head and a tawny tint in her complexion and 
especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck by 
the grace of her movements by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs and 
by a certain coyness and reserve of manner she reminded one of a pretty half 
grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat she evidently considered it proper 
to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling but in spite of herself 
her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join 
the army with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single 
instant impose upon anyone and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only 
to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as 
they too could like natásha and borís escape from the drawing room yes my dear 
said the count addressing the visitor and pointing to nicholas friend borís has become an 
officer and so for sake he is leaving the university and me his old father 
and entering the military service my dear and there was a place and everything waiting 
for him in the archives department that friendship remarked the count in an inquiring tone 
they say that war has been declared replied the visitor been saying so a long 
while said the count say so again and again and that will be the end 
of it my dear friendship for you he repeated joining the hussars the visitor not 
knowing what to say shook her head not at all from friendship declared nicholas flaring 
up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion is not from friendship at 
all i simply feel that the army is my vocation he glanced at his cousin 
and the young lady visitor and they were both regarding him with a smile of 
approbation the colonel of the pávlograd hussars is dining with us today he has been 
here on leave and is taking nicholas back with him it be helped said the 
count shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him have 
already told you papa said his son if you wish to let me go stay 
but i know i am no use anywhere except in the army i am not 
a diplomat or a government clerk know how to hide what i feel as he 
spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at sónya and the 
young lady visitor the little kitten feasting her eyes on him seemed ready at any 
moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature right all right said 
the old count always flares up this buonaparte has turned all their heads they all 
think of how he rose from an ensign and became emperor well well god grant 
it he added not noticing his sarcastic smile the elders began talking about bonaparte julie 
karágina turned to young rostóv a pity you at the on thursday it was so 
dull without you said she giving him a tender smile the young man flattered sat 
down nearer to her with a coquettish smile and engaged the smiling julie in a 
confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of 
sónya who blushed and smiled unnaturally in the midst of his talk he glanced round 
at her she gave him a passionately angry glance and hardly able to restrain her 
tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips she got up and left the 
room all animation vanished he waited for the first pause in the conversation and then 
with a distressed face left the room to find sónya plainly all these young people 
wear their hearts on their sleeves said anna mikháylovna pointing to nicholas as he went 
out voisinage she added cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood said the countess when the brightness 
these young people had brought into the room had vanished and as if answering a 
question no one had put but which was always in her mind how much suffering 
how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them 
now and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy one is always 
always anxious especially just at this age so dangerous both for girls and boys all 
depends on the bringing up remarked the visitor quite right continued the countess now i 
have always thank god been my friend and had their full confidence said she repeating 
the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from 
them know i shall always be my first confidante and that if nicholas with his 
impulsive nature does get into mischief a boy help it he will all the same 
never be like those petersburg young men they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the 
count who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was 
splendid fancy wants to be an hussar one to do my dear a charming creature 
your younger girl is said the visitor little volcano a regular volcano said the count 
after me and what a voice she has though my daughter i tell the truth 
when i say be a singer a second salomoni we have engaged an italian to 
give her lessons she too young i have heard that it harms the voice to 
train it at that age no not at all too young replied the count our 
mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen in love with borís already just 
fancy said the countess with a gentle smile looking at borís and went on evidently 
concerned with a thought that always occupied her you see if i were to be 
severe with her and to forbid it goodness knows what they might be up to 
on the she meant that they would be kissing as it is i know every 
word she utters she will come running to me of her own accord in the 
evening and tell me everything perhaps i spoil her but really that seems the best 
plan with her elder sister i was stricter i was brought up quite differently remarked 
the handsome elder daughter countess véra with a smile but the smile did not enhance 
beauty as smiles generally do on the contrary it gave her an unnatural and therefore 
unpleasant expression véra was good looking not at all stupid quick at learning was well 
brought up and had a pleasant voice what she said was true and appropriate yet 
strange to say visitors and countess to look at her as if wondering why she 
had said it and they all felt awkward are always too clever with their eldest 
children and try to make something exceptional of them said the visitor the good of 
denying it my dear our dear countess was too clever with véra said the count 
what of that turned out splendidly all the same he added winking at véra the 
guests got up and took their leave promising to return to dinner manners i thought 
they would never go said the countess when she had seen her guests out chapter 
xiii when natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as 
the conservatory there she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room 
waiting for borís to come out she was already growing impatient and stamped her foot 
ready to cry at his not coming at once when she heard the young discreet 
steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly at this natásha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs 
and hid there borís paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a 
little dust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examined 
his handsome face natásha very still peered out from her ambush waiting to see what 
he would do he stood a little while before the glass smiled and walked toward 
the other door natásha was about to call him but changed her mind him look 
for me thought she hardly had borís gone than sónya flushed in tears and muttering 
angrily came in at the other door natásha checked her first impulse to run out 
to her and remained in her hiding place under an invisible see what went on 
in the world she was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure sónya muttering to herself 
kept looking round toward the drawing room door it opened and nicholas came in what 
is the matter with you how can you said he running up to her nothing 
nothing leave me alone sobbed sónya i know what it is if you do so 
much the better and you can go back to her o onya look here how 
can you torture me and yourself like that for a mere fancy said nicholas taking 
her hand sónya did not pull it away and left off crying natásha not stirring 
and scarcely breathing watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes will happen now thought she 
what is anyone in the world to me you alone are everything said nicholas i 
will prove it to you like you to talk like that then i only forgive 
me sónya he drew her to him and kissed her how nice thought natásha and 
when sónya and nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called borís 
to her come here said she with a sly and significant look have something to 
tell you here here and she led him into the conservatory to the place among 
the tubs where she had been hiding borís followed her smiling is the something asked 
he she grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had thrown down on 
one of the tubs picked it up the doll said she borís looked attentively and 
kindly at her eager face but did not reply you want to well then come 
here said she and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll 
closer she whispered she caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look of 
solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face me would you like to kiss me 
she whispered almost inaudibly glancing up at him from under her brows smiling and almost 
crying from excitement borís blushed funny you are he said bending down to her and 
blushing still more but he waited and did nothing suddenly she jumped up onto a 
tub to be higher than he embraced him so that both her slender bare arms 
clasped him above his neck and tossing back her hair kissed him full on the 
lips then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs 
and stood hanging her head he said know that i love you but are in 
love with me natásha broke in i am but please let us do like that 
in another four years then i will ask for your hand natásha considered fourteen fifteen 
sixteen she counted on her slender little fingers right then settled a smile of joy 
and satisfaction lit up her eager face replied borís said the little girl death itself 
she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining 
sitting room chapter xiv after receiving her visitors the countess was so tired that she 
gave orders to admit no more but the porter was told to be sure to 
invite to dinner all who came congratulate the countess wished to have a tête à 
tête talk with the friend of her childhood princess anna mikháylovna whom she had not 
seen properly since she returned from petersburg anna mikháylovna with her tear worn but pleasant 
face drew her chair nearer to that of the countess you i will be quite 
frank said anna mikháylovna are not many left of us old friends why i so 
value your friendship anna mikháylovna looked at véra and paused the countess pressed her hand 
she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite is it you 
have so little tact you see you are not wanted here go to the other 
girls or the handsome véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt you 
had told me sooner mamma i would have gone she replied as she rose to 
go to her own room but as she passed the sitting room she noticed two 
couples sitting one pair at each window she stopped and smiled scornfully sónya was sitting 
close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her the first he had 
ever written borís and natásha were at the other window and ceased talking when véra 
entered sónya and natásha looked at véra with guilty happy faces it was pleasant and 
touching to see these little girls in love but apparently the sight of them roused 
no pleasant feeling in véra often have i asked you not to take my things 
she said have a room of your own and she took the inkstand from nicholas 
a minute in a minute he said dipping his pen always manage to do things 
at the wrong time continued véra came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone 
felt ashamed of you though what she said was quite just perhaps for that very 
reason no one replied and the four simply looked at one another she lingered in 
the room with the inkstand in her hand at your age what secrets can there 
be between natásha and borís or between you two all nonsense véra what does it 
matter to you said natásha in defense speaking very gently she seemed that day to 
be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone silly said véra am ashamed of 
you secrets indeed have secrets of their own answered natásha getting warmer interfere with you 
and berg should think not said véra there can never be anything wrong in my 
behavior but just tell mamma how you are behaving with borís ilyníchna behaves very well 
to me remarked borís have nothing to complain of borís you are such a diplomat 
that it is really tiresome said natásha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly she 
used the word which was just then much in vogue among the children in the 
special sense they attached to it does she bother me and she added turning to 
véra never understand it because never loved anyone you have no heart you are a 
madame de genlis and nothing this nickname bestowed on véra by nicholas was considered very 
stinging your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people go and flirt with berg 
as much as you please she finished quickly shall at any rate not run after 
a young man before visitors now done what you wanted put in unpleasant things to 
everyone and upset them go to the nursery all four like a flock of scared 
birds got up and left the room unpleasant things were said to me remarked véra 
said none to anyone de genlis madame de genlis shouted laughing voices through the door 
the handsome véra who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone smiled and 
evidently unmoved by what had been said to her went to the looking glass and 
arranged her hair and scarf looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become 
still colder and calmer in the drawing room the conversation was still going on my 
dear said the countess life is not all roses either i know that at the 
rate we are living our means last long all the club and his easygoing nature 
even in the country do we get any rest theatricals hunting and heaven knows what 
besides but talk about me tell me how you managed everything i often wonder at 
you at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to moscow to 
petersburg to those ministers and great people and know how to deal with them all 
quite astonishing how did you get things settled i possibly do it my love answered 
anna mikháylovna grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without 
means and with a son you love to distraction one learns many things then she 
added with a certain pride lawsuit taught me much when i want to see one 
of those big people i write a note so and so desires an interview with 
so and so and then i take a cab and go myself two three or 
four i get what i want i mind what they think of me and to 
whom did you apply about bóry asked the countess see yours is already an officer 
in the guards while my nicholas is going as a cadet no one to interest 
himself for him to whom did you apply prince vasíli he was so kind he 
at once agreed to everything and put the matter before the emperor said princess anna 
mikháylovna enthusiastically quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end prince 
vasíli aged much asked the countess have not seen him since we acted together at 
the theatricals i expect he has forgotten me he paid me attentions in those days 
said the countess with a smile is just the same as ever replied anna mikháylovna 
with amiability his position has not turned his head at all he said to me 
am sorry i can do so little for you dear princess i am at your 
command yes he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation but nataly you 
know my love for my son i would do anything for his happiness and my 
affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one 
continued anna mikháylovna sadly dropping her voice wretched lawsuit takes all i have and makes 
no progress would you believe it i have literally not a penny and know how 
to equip borís she took out her handkerchief and began to cry need five hundred 
rubles and have only one twenty five ruble note i am in such a state 
my only hope now is in count cyril vladímirovich bezúkhov if he will not assist 
his know he is allow him something for his maintenance all my trouble will have 
been thrown away i shall not be able to equip him the eyes filled with 
tears and she pondered in silence often think though perhaps a sin said the princess 
here lives count cyril vladímirovich bezúkhov so rich all alone that tremendous fortune and what 
is his life worth a burden to him and life is only just beginning he 
will leave something to borís said the countess only knows my dear these rich grandees 
are so selfish still i will take borís and go to see him at once 
and i shall speak to him straight out let people think what they will of 
me really all the same to me when my fate is at stake the princess 
rose now two and you dine at four there will just be time and like 
a practical petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time anna mikháylovna 
sent someone to call her son and went into the anteroom with him by my 
dear said she to the countess who saw her to the door and added in 
a whisper so that her son should not hear me good luck you going to 
count cyril vladímirovich my dear said the count coming out from the dining hall into 
the anteroom and he added he is better ask pierre to dine with us he 
has been to the house you know and danced with the children be sure to 
invite him my dear we will see how tarás distinguishes himself today he says count 
orlóv never gave such a dinner as ours will be chapter xv dear borís said 
princess anna mikháylovna to her son as countess carriage in which they were seated drove 
over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of count cyril vladímirovich 
house dear borís said the mother drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and 
laying it timidly and tenderly on her arm affectionate and attentive to him count cyril 
vladímirovich is your godfather after all and your future depends on him remember that my 
dear and be nice to him as you so well know how to be only 
i knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it answered her son coldly i 
have promised and will do it for your sake although the hall porter saw carriage 
standing at the entrance after scrutinizing the mother and son who without asking to be 
announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches 
and looking significantly at the old cloak he asked whether they wanted the count or 
the princesses and hearing that they wished to see the count said his excellency was 
worse today and that his excellency was not receiving anyone may as well go back 
said the son in french dear exclaimed his mother imploringly again laying her hand on 
his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him borís said no more 
but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak friend said anna mikháylovna 
in gentle tones addressing the hall porter know count cyril vladímirovich is very ill why 
i have come i am a relation i shall not disturb him my friend i 
only need see prince vasíli sergéevich he is staying here is he not please announce 
me the hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs and turned away drubetskáya 
to see prince vasíli sergéevich he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches shoes 
and a swallow tail coat who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing 
the mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large venetian mirror 
in the wall and in her trodden down shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs dear 
she said to her son once more stimulating him by a touch promised me the 
son lowering his eyes followed her quietly they entered the large hall from which one 
of the doors led to the apartments assigned to prince vasíli just as the mother 
and son having reached the middle of the hall were about to ask their way 
of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered the bronze handle of 
one of the doors turned and prince vasíli came a velvet coat with a single 
star on his breast as was his custom when at leave of a good looking 
dark haired man this was the celebrated petersburg doctor lorrain it is certain said the 
prince humanum est errare but replied the doctor swallowing his and pronouncing the latin words 
with a french accent to err is human well very well seeing anna mikháylovna and 
her son prince vasíli dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and 
with a look of inquiry the son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly 
clouded his face and he smiled slightly prince in what sad circumstances we meet again 
and how is our dear invalid said she as though unaware of the cold offensive 
look fixed on her prince vasíli stared at her and at borís questioningly and perplexed 
borís bowed politely prince vasíli without acknowledging the bow turned to anna mikháylovna answering her 
query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the 
patient it possible exclaimed anna mikháylovna how awful it is terrible to think this is 
my son she added indicating borís wanted to thank you himself borís bowed again politely 
me prince a heart will never forget what you have done for us am glad 
i was able to do you a service my dear anna mikháylovna said prince vasíli 
arranging his lace frill and in tone and manner here in moscow to anna mikháylovna 
whom he had placed under an obligation assuming an air of much greater importance than 
he had done in petersburg at anna reception to serve well and show yourself worthy 
added he addressing borís with severity am glad are you here on leave he went 
on in his usual tone of indifference am awaiting orders to join my new regiment 
your excellency replied borís betraying neither annoyance at the brusque manner nor a desire to 
enter into conversation but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a 
searching glance you living with your mother am living at countess replied borís again adding 
excellency is with ilyá rostóv who married nataly shinshiná said anna mikháylovna know i know 
answered prince vasíli in his monotonous voice never could understand how nataly made up her 
mind to marry that unlicked bear a perfectly absurd and stupid fellow and a gambler 
too i am told a very kind man prince said anna mikháylovna with a pathetic 
smile as though she too knew that count rostóv deserved this censure but asked him 
not to be too hard on the poor old man do the doctors say asked 
the princess after a pause her worn face again expressing deep sorrow give little hope 
replied the prince i should so like to thank uncle once for all his kindness 
to me and borís he is his godson she added her tone suggesting that this 
fact ought to give prince vasíli much satisfaction prince vasíli became thoughtful and frowned anna 
mikháylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count fortune 
and hastened to reassure him it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to 
uncle said she uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern know his character noble 
upright but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses they 
are still young she bent her head and continued in a whisper he performed his 
final duty prince how priceless are those last moments it can make things no worse 
and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill we women 
prince and she smiled tenderly know how to say these things i absolutely must see 
him however painful it may be for me i am used to suffering evidently the 
prince understood her and also understood as he had done at anna that it would 
be difficult to get rid of anna mikháylovna not such a meeting be too trying 
for him dear anna mikháylovna said he us wait until evening the doctors are expecting 
a crisis one cannot delay prince at such a moment consider that the welfare of 
his soul is at stake ah it is awful the duties of a christian a 
door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses the niece 
entered with a cold stern face the length of her body was strikingly out of 
proportion to her short legs prince vasíli turned to her how is he the same 
but what can you expect this noise said the princess looking at anna mikháylovna as 
at a stranger my dear i hardly knew you said anna mikháylovna with a happy 
smile ambling lightly up to the niece have come and am at your service to 
help you nurse my uncle i imagine what you have gone through and she sympathetically 
turned up her eyes the princess gave no reply and did not even smile but 
left the room as anna mikháylovna took off her gloves and occupying the position she 
had conquered settled down in an armchair inviting prince vasíli to take a seat beside 
her she said to her son with a smile shall go in to see the 
count my uncle but you my dear had better go to pierre meanwhile and forget 
to give him the invitation they ask him to dinner i suppose he go she 
continued turning to the prince the contrary replied the prince who had plainly become depressed 
shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man here he 
is and the count has not once asked for him he shrugged his shoulders a 
footman conducted borís down one flight of stairs and up another to rooms chapter xvi 
pierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself in petersburg and 
had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to moscow the story told 
about him at count was true pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to 
a bear he had now been for some days in moscow and was staying as 
usual at his house though he expected that the story of his escapade would be 
already known in moscow and that the ladies about his were never favorably disposed toward 
have used it to turn the count against him he nevertheless on the day of 
his arrival went to his part of the house entering the drawing room where the 
princesses spent most of their time he greeted the ladies two of whom were sitting 
at embroidery frames while a third read aloud it was the eldest who was one 
who had met anna mikháylovna the two younger ones were embroidering both were rosy and 
pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip 
which made her much prettier pierre was received as if he were a corpse or 
a leper the eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with 
frightened eyes the second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngest the one with 
the mole who was of a cheerful and lively disposition bent over her frame to 
hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw she drew her wool 
down through the canvas and scarcely able to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying 
to make out the pattern do you do cousin said pierre recognize me recognize you 
only too well too well is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly 
as usual but unabashed count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you have done 
your best to increase his mental sufferings i see the count pierre again asked if 
you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can see him olga go 
and see whether beef tea is is almost time she added giving pierre to understand 
that they were busy and busy making his father comfortable while evidently he pierre was 
only busy causing him annoyance olga went out pierre stood looking at the sisters then 
he bowed and said i will go to my rooms you will let me know 
when i can see him and he left the room followed by the low but 
ringing laughter of the sister with the mole next day prince vasíli had arrived and 
settled in the house he sent for pierre and said to him dear fellow if 
you are going to behave here as you did in petersburg you will end very 
badly that is all i have to say to you the count is very very 
ill and you must not see him at all since then pierre had not been 
disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs when borís appeared at 
his door pierre was pacing up and down his room stopping occasionally at a corner 
to make menacing gestures at the wall as if running a sword through an invisible 
foe and glaring savagely over his spectacles and then again resuming his walk muttering indistinct 
words shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating is done for said he scowling and pointing his 
finger at someone unseen pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the rights 
of man is sentenced to but before at that moment imagined himself to be napoleon 
in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover 
and captured pronounce sentence he saw a well built and handsome young officer entering his 
room pierre paused he had left moscow when borís was a boy of fourteen and 
had quite forgotten him but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took borís 
by the hand with a friendly smile you remember me asked borís quietly with a 
pleasant smile have come with my mother to see the count but it seems he 
is not well it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him answered pierre 
trying to remember who this young man was borís felt that pierre did not recognize 
him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the least 
embarrassment looked pierre straight in the face rostóv asks you to come to dinner today 
said he after a considerable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortable count rostóv exclaimed pierre 
joyfully you are his son ilyá only fancy i know you at first do you 
remember how we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot such an age are 
mistaken said borís deliberately with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile am borís son of 
princess anna mikháylovna drubetskáya rostóv the father is ilyá and his son is nicholas i 
never knew any madame jacquot pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by 
mosquitoes or bees dear what am i thinking about mixed everything up one has so 
many relatives in moscow so you are borís of course well now we know where 
we are and what do you think of the boulogne expedition the english will come 
off badly you know if napoleon gets across the channel i think the expedition is 
quite feasible if only villeneuve make a mess of things borís knew nothing about the 
boulogne expedition he did not read the papers and it was the first time he 
had heard name here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than 
with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone know nothing about it and have 
not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy with gossip he continued now they are 
talking about you and your father pierre smiled in his good natured way as if 
afraid for his sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret but 
borís spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into eyes has nothing else to do 
but gossip borís went on is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune 
though he may perhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he will it is 
all very horrid interrupted pierre horrid pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently 
say something disconcerting to himself it must seem to you said borís flushing slightly but 
not changing his tone or attitude must seem to you that everyone is trying to 
get something out of the rich man it does thought pierre i just wish to 
say to avoid misunderstandings that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my 
mother among such people we are very poor but for my own part at any 
rate for the very reason that your father is rich i regard myself as a 
relation of his and neither i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything 
from him for a long time pierre could not understand but when he did he 
jumped up from the sofa seized borís under the elbow in his quick clumsy way 
and blushing far more than borís began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame 
and vexation this is strange do you suppose i who could think i know very 
well but borís again interrupted him am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps you 
did not like it you must excuse me said he putting pierre at ease instead 
of being put at ease by him i hope i have not offended you i 
always make it a rule to speak out well what answer am i to take 
will you come to dinner at the and borís having apparently relieved himself of an 
onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it became 
quite pleasant again but i say said pierre calming down are a wonderful fellow what 
you have just said is good very good of course you know me we have 
not met for such a long time not since we were children you might think 
that i i understand quite understand i could not have done it myself i should 
not have had the courage but splendid i am very glad to have made your 
acquaintance queer he added after a pause you should have suspected me he began to 
laugh what of it i hope get better acquainted and he pressed hand you know 
i have not once been in to see the count he has not sent for 
me i am sorry for him as a man but what can one do so 
you think napoleon will manage to get an army across asked borís with a smile 
pierre saw that borís wished to change the subject and being of the same mind 
he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the boulogne expedition a footman came in 
to summon princess was going pierre in order to make better acquaintance promised to come 
to dinner and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into eyes after 
he had gone pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time 
no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance 
of that pleasant intelligent and resolute young man as often happens in early youth especially 
to one who leads a lonely life he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young 
man and made up his mind that they would be friends prince vasíli saw the 
princess off she held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful is 
dreadful dreadful she was saying cost me what it may i shall do my duty 
i will come and spend the night he must not be left like this every 
moment is precious i think why his nieces put it off perhaps god will help 
me to find a way to prepare him adieu prince may god support you ma 
bonne answered prince vasíli turning away from her he is in a dreadful state said 
the mother to her son when they were in the carriage hardly recognizes anybody understand 
is his attitude to pierre asked the son will will show that my dear our 
fate also depends on it why do you expect that he will leave us anything 
my dear he is so rich and we are so poor that is hardly a 
sufficient reason mamma heaven how ill he is exclaimed the mother chapter xvii after anna 
mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit count cyril vladímirovich bezúkhov countess rostóva 
sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes at last 
she rang is the matter with you my dear she said crossly to the maid 
who kept her waiting some minutes you wish to serve me then find you another 
place the countess was upset by her sorrow and humiliating poverty and was therefore out 
of sorts a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her 
maid and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness am very sorry answered the maid the 
count to come to me the count came waddling in to see his wife with 
a rather guilty look as usual little countess what a sauté of game au madère 
we are to have my dear i tasted it the thousand rubles i paid for 
tarás were not ill spent he is worth it he sat down by his wife 
his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair are your commands 
little countess see my dear that mess she said pointing to his waistcoat the sauté 
most likely she added with a smile you see count i want some money her 
face became sad little countess and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook 
want a great deal count i want five hundred rubles and taking out her cambric 
handkerchief she began wiping her waistcoat immediately immediately hey there he called out in a 
tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to 
obey the summons dmítri to me dmítri a man of good family who had been 
brought up in the house and now managed all his affairs stepped softly into the 
room is what i want my dear fellow said the count to the deferential young 
man who had entered me he reflected a moment bring me seven hundred rubles yes 
but mind bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time but nice clean 
ones for the countess dmítri clean ones please said the countess sighing deeply would you 
like them your excellency asked dmítri me to inform you but be uneasy he added 
noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a 
sign of approaching anger was forgetting do you wish it brought at once yes just 
so bring it give it to the countess a treasure that dmítri is added the 
count with a smile when the young man had departed is never any with him 
a thing i hate everything is possible money count money how much sorrow it causes 
in the world said the countess i am in great need of this sum my 
little countess are a notorious spendthrift said the count and having kissed his hand he 
went back to his study when anna mikháylovna returned from count the money all in 
clean notes was lying ready under a handkerchief on the little table and anna mikháylovna 
noticed that something was agitating her my dear asked the countess what a terrible state 
he is in one would not know him he is so ill i was only 
there a few moments and hardly said a word for sake refuse me the countess 
began with a blush that looked very strange on her thin dignified elderly face and 
she took the money from under the handkerchief anna mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and 
stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment is for borís 
from me for his outfit anna mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping the countess 
wept too they wept because they were friends and because they were kindhearted and because 
from to think about such a base thing as money and because their youth was 
over but those tears were pleasant to them both chapter xviii countess rostóva with her 
daughters and a large number of guests was already seated in the drawing room the 
count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of turkish 
pipes from time to time he went out to ask she come yet they were 
expecting márya dmítrievna akhrosímova known in society as le terrible dragon a lady distinguished not 
for wealth or rank but for common sense and frank plainness of speech márya dmítrievna 
was known to the imperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg and 
both cities wondered at her laughed privately at her rudenesses and told good stories about 
her while none the less all without exception respected and feared her in the room 
which was full of tobacco smoke they talked of the war that had been announced 
in a manifesto and about the recruiting none of them had yet seen the manifesto 
but they all knew it had appeared the count sat on the sofa between two 
guests who were smoking and talking he neither smoked nor talked but bending his head 
first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure 
and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom he egged on against each 
other one of them was a sallow clean shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled 
face already growing old though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man he 
sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and having 
stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing 
up his eyes this was an old bachelor shinshín a cousin of the a man 
with sharp as they said in moscow society he seemed to be condescending to his 
companion the latter a fresh rosy officer of the guards irreproachably washed brushed and buttoned 
held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled 
the smoke letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings this was lieutenant berg 
an officer in the semënov regiment with whom borís was to travel to join the 
army and about whom natásha had teased her elder sister véra speaking of berg as 
her the count sat between them and listened attentively his favorite occupation when not playing 
boston a card game he was very fond of was that of listener especially when 
he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another then old chap mon très 
honorable alphonse kárlovich said shinshín laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russian expressions with 
the choicest french was a peculiarity of his speech comptez vous faire des rentes sur 
you want to make something out of your company you expect to make an income 
out of the government peter nikoláevich i only want to show that in the cavalry 
the advantages are far less than in the infantry just consider my own position now 
peter nikoláevich berg always spoke quietly politely and with great precision his conversation always related 
entirely to himself he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any 
topic that had no direct bearing on himself he could remain silent for hours without 
being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but as soon 
as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction 
my position peter nikoláevich were i in the cavalry i should get not more than 
two hundred rubles every four months even with the rank of lieutenant but as it 
is i receive two hundred and thirty said he looking at shinshín and the count 
with a joyful pleasant smile as if it were obvious to him that his success 
must always be the chief desire of everyone else that peter nikoláevich by exchanging into 
the guards i shall be in a more prominent position continued berg vacancies occur much 
more frequently in the foot guards then just think what can be done with two 
hundred and thirty rubles i even manage to put a little aside and to send 
something to my father he went on emitting a smoke ring balance y est a 
german knows how to skin a flint as the proverb says remarked shinshín moving his 
pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count so that 
squares matters the count burst out laughing the other guests seeing that shinshín was talking 
came up to listen berg oblivious of irony or indifference continued to explain how by 
exchanging into the guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of 
the cadet corps how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he as 
senior in the company might easily succeed to the post how popular he was with 
everyone in the regiment and how satisfied his father was with him berg evidently enjoyed 
narrating all this and did not seem to suspect that others too might have their 
own interests but all he said was so prettily sedate and the naïveté of his 
youthful egotism was so obvious that he disarmed his hearers my boy get along wherever 
you or warrant said shinshín patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off 
the sofa berg smiled joyously the count followed by his guests went into the drawing 
room it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests expecting 
the summons to zakúska avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to 
move about and talk in order to show that they are not at all impatient 
for their food the host and hostess look toward the door and now and then 
glance at one another and the visitors try to guess from these glances who or 
what they are waiting important relation who has not yet arrived or a dish that 
is not yet ready hors pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly 
in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across 
blocking the way for everyone the countess tried to make him talk but he went 
on naïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered 
all her questions in monosyllables he was in the way and was the only one 
who did not notice the fact most of the guests knowing of the affair with 
the bear looked with curiosity at this big stout quiet man wondering how such a 
clumsy modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman have only lately 
arrived the countess asked him madame replied he looking around him have not yet seen 
my husband madame he smiled quite inappropriately have been in paris recently i believe i 
suppose very interesting interesting the countess exchanged glances with anna mikháylovna the latter understood that 
she was being asked to entertain this young man and sitting down beside him she 
began to speak about his father but he answered her as he had the countess 
only in monosyllables the other guests were all conversing with one another razumóvskis it was 
charming you are very kind countess apráksina was heard on all sides the countess rose 
and went into the ballroom dmítrievna came her voice from there came the answer in 
a rough voice and márya dmítrievna entered the room all the unmarried ladies and even 
the married ones except the very oldest rose márya dmítrievna paused at the door tall 
and stout holding high her fifty year old head with its gray curls she stood 
surveying the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up márya 
dmítrievna always spoke in russian and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping 
and to her children she said in her loud full toned voice which drowned all 
others you old sinner she went on turning to the count who was kissing her 
hand feeling dull in moscow i daresay nowhere to hunt with your dogs but what 
is to be done old man just see how these nestlings are growing up and 
she pointed to the girls must look for husbands for them whether you like it 
or not said she my cossack márya dmítrievna always called natásha a cossack and she 
stroked the arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand know 
a scamp of a girl but i like her she took a pair of pear 
shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and having given them to the rosy natásha 
who beamed with the pleasure of her day fete turned away at once and addressed 
herself to pierre eh friend come here a bit said she assuming a soft high 
tone of voice here my friend and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher 
pierre approached looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles nearer come nearer 
friend i used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when 
he was in favor and in your case my evident duty she paused all were 
silent expectant of what was to follow for this was clearly only a prelude fine 
lad my word a fine lad his father lies on his deathbed and he amuses 
himself setting a policeman astride a bear for shame sir for shame it would be 
better if you went to the war she turned away and gave her hand to 
the count who could hardly keep from laughing i suppose it is time we were 
at table said márya dmítrievna the count went in first with márya dmítrievna the countess 
followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to them 
because nicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came anna mikháylovna with 
shinshín berg gave his arm to véra the smiling julie karágina went in with nicholas 
after them other couples followed filling the whole dining hall and last of all the 
children tutors and governesses followed singly the footmen began moving about chairs scraped the band 
struck up in the gallery and the guests settled down in their places then the 
strains of the household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks the 
voices of visitors and the soft steps of the footmen at one end of the 
table sat the countess with márya dmítrievna on her right and anna mikháylovna on her 
left the other lady visitors were farther down at the other end sat the count 
with the hussar colonel on his left and shinshín and the other male visitors on 
his right midway down the long table on one side sat the grown up young 
people véra beside berg and pierre beside borís and on the other side the children 
tutors and governesses from behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing 
at his wife and her tall cap with its light blue ribbons and busily filled 
his glasses not neglecting his own the countess in turn without omitting her duties as 
hostess threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald 
head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair at 
the end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time at the end 
the voices sounded louder and louder especially that of the colonel of hussars who growing 
more and more flushed ate and drank so much that the count held him up 
as a pattern to the other guests berg with tender smiles was saying to véra 
that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling borís was telling his new 
friend pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with natásha who was sitting opposite 
pierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate a great deal of the 
two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without 
omitting a single dish or one of the wines these latter the butler thrust mysteriously 
forward wrapped in a napkin from behind the next shoulders and whispered or as the 
case might be of the four crystal glasses engraved with the monogram that stood before 
his plate pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment gazing with ever 
increasing amiability at the other guests natásha who sat opposite was looking at borís as 
girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just 
kissed for the first time sometimes that same look fell on pierre and that funny 
lively little look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why nicholas sat at some 
distance from sónya beside julie karágina to whom he was again talking with the same 
involuntary smile sónya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she 
turned pale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas and julie were 
saying to one another the governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent 
any slight that might be put upon the children the german tutor was trying to 
remember all the dishes wines and kinds of dessert in order to send a full 
description of the dinner to his people in germany and he felt greatly offended when 
the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by he frowned trying 
to appear as if he did not want any of that wine but was mortified 
because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from 
greediness that he wanted it but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge chapter xix 
at the end of the table the talk grew more and more animated the colonel 
told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in petersburg and that a 
copy which he had himself seen had that day been forwarded by courier to the 
commander in chief why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte remarked shinshín has 
stopped cackle and i fear it will be our turn next the colonel was a 
stout tall plethoric german evidently devoted to the service and patriotically russian he resented remark 
is for the reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a german accent the 
reasson zat ze emperor knows zat he declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew 
wiz indifference ze danger vreatening russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze empire 
as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances he spoke this last word with particular 
emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter then with the unerring 
official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto and 
the wish which constitutes the sole and absolute establish peace in europe on firm now 
decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition 
for the attainment of that purpose my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking a 
tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval vous le proverbe 
jerome do not roam but turn spindles at home said shinshín puckering his brows and 
smiling nous convient à merveille 2 suvórov knew what he was about yet they beat 
him à plate couture 3 and where are we to find suvórovs now je vous 
demande un peu 4 said he continually changing from french to russian do you know 
the proverb 2 that suits us down to the ground 3 hollow 4 i just 
ask you that must vight to the last tr r op of our plood said 
the colonel thumping the table ve must tie for our emperor and zen all vill 
pe vell and ve must discuss it as little as po o he dwelt particularly 
on the word possible po o ossible he ended again turning to the count is 
how ve old hussars look at it and an end of it and how do 
you a young man and a young hussar how do you judge of it he 
added addressing nicholas who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned 
from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel am quite of your 
opinion replied nicholas flaming up turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with 
as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great 
danger am convinced that we russians must die or conquer he concluded were the words 
were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were 
therefore awkward you said just now was splendid said his partner julie sónya trembled all 
over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and 
shoulders while nicholas was speaking pierre listened to the speech and nodded approvingly fine said 
he young a real hussar shouted the colonel again thumping the table are you making 
such a noise about over there márya deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end 
of the table are you thumping the table for she demanded of the hussar why 
are you exciting yourself do you think the french are here am speaking ze truce 
replied the hussar with a smile all about the war the count shouted down the 
table know my going márya dmítrievna my son is going have four sons in the 
army but still i fret it is all in hands you may die in your 
bed or god may spare you in a battle replied márya deep voice which easily 
carried the whole length of the table true once more the conversations concentrated the at 
the one end and the at the other ask little brother was saying know you 
ask will replied natásha her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution she half 
rose by a glance inviting pierre who sat opposite to listen to what was coming 
and turning to her mother rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice 
audible the whole length of the table is it asked the countess startled but seeing 
by her face that it was only mischief she shook a finger at her sternly 
with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head the conversation was hushed what sweets 
are we going to have and voice sounded still more firm and resolute the countess 
tried to frown but could not márya dmítrievna shook her fat finger she said threateningly 
most of the guests uncertain how to regard this sally looked at the elders had 
better take care said the countess what sweets are we going to have natásha again 
cried boldly with saucy gaiety confident that her prank would be taken in good part 
sónya and fat little pétya doubled up with laughter see i have asked whispered natásha 
to her little brother and to pierre glancing at him again pudding but you get 
any said márya dmítrievna natásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so 
she braved even márya dmítrievna dmítrievna what kind of ice pudding i like ice cream 
ices what kind márya dmítrievna what kind she almost screamed want to know márya dmítrievna 
and the countess burst out laughing and all the guests joined in everyone laughed not 
at márya answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who 
had dared to treat márya dmítrievna in this fashion natásha only desisted when she had 
been told that there would be pineapple ice before the ices champagne was served round 
the band again struck up the count and countess kissed and the guests leaving their 
seats went up to the countess and reached across the table to clink glasses with 
the count with the children and with one another again the footmen rushed about chairs 
scraped and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces 
the guests returned to the drawing room and to the study chapter xx the card 
tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and the visitors settled themselves some 
in the two drawing rooms some in the sitting room some in the library the 
count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual after 
dinner nap and laughed at everything the young people at the instigation gathered round the 
clavichord and harp julie by general request played first after she had played a little 
air with variations on the harp she joined the other young ladies in begging natásha 
and nicholas who were noted for their musical talent to sing something natásha who was 
treated as though she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at 
the same time felt shy shall we sing she said brook suggested nicholas then be 
quick borís come here said natásha where is sónya she looked round and seeing that 
her friend was not in the room ran to look for her running into room 
and not finding her there natásha ran to the nursery but sónya was not there 
either natásha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage the chest 
in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the 
rostóv household and there in fact was sónya lying face downward on dirty feather bed 
on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her hiding her 
face with her slender fingers and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook 
face which had been so radiantly happy all that day suddenly changed her eyes became 
fixed and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her 
mouth drooped what is it what is the matter oo oo oo and large mouth 
widened making her look quite ugly and she began to wail like a baby without 
knowing why except that sónya was crying sónya tried to lift her head to answer 
but could not and hid her face still deeper in the bed natásha wept sitting 
on the blue striped feather bed and hugging her friend with an effort sónya sat 
up and began wiping her eyes and explaining is going away in a time his 
papers have come he told me himself but still i should not cry and she 
showed a paper she held in her the verses nicholas had written i should not 
cry but you no one can understand what a soul he has and she began 
to cry again because he had such a noble soul all very well for you 
i am not envious i love you and borís also she went on gaining a 
little strength is nice there are no difficulties in your way but nicholas is my 
cousin one would have to the metropolitan himself and even then it be done and 
besides if she tells sónya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her 
so i am spoiling career and am heartless and ungrateful while truly god is my 
witness and she made the sign of the cross love her so much and all 
of you only véra and what for what have i done to her i am 
so grateful to you that i would willingly sacrifice everything only i have nothing sónya 
could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather 
bed natásha began consoling her but her face showed that she understood all the gravity 
of her trouble she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true reason of 
her sorrow sure véra has said something to you since dinner she these verses nicholas 
wrote himself and i copied some others and she found them on my table and 
said show them to mamma and that i was ungrateful and that mamma would never 
allow him to marry me but that marry julie you see how been with her 
all day natásha what have i done to deserve it and again she began to 
sob more bitterly than before natásha lifted her up hugged her and smiling through her 
tears began comforting her believe her darling believe her do you remember how we and 
nicholas all three of us talked in the sitting room after supper why we settled 
how everything was to be i quite remember how but you remember that it could 
all be arranged and how nice it all was uncle brother has married his first 
cousin and we are only second cousins you know and borís says it is quite 
possible you know i have told him all about it and he is so clever 
and so good said natásha you cry sónya dear love darling sónya and she kissed 
her and laughed spiteful never mind her and all will come right and she say 
anything to mamma nicholas will tell her himself and he care at all for julie 
natásha kissed her on the hair sónya sat up the little kitten brightened its eyes 
shone and it seemed ready to lift its tail jump down on its soft paws 
and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should you think so 
really truly she said quickly smoothing her frock and hair truly answered natásha pushing in 
a crisp lock that had strayed from under her plaits both laughed go and sing 
brook along you know that fat pierre who sat opposite me is so funny said 
natásha stopping suddenly feel so happy and she set off at a run along the 
passage sónya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses 
in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest ran after natásha 
down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light joyous steps at 
the request the young people sang the quartette brook with which everyone was delighted then 
nicholas sang a song he had just learned at nighttime in the fair glow how 
sweet as fancies wander free to feel that in this world one who still is 
thinking but of thee that while her fingers touch the harp wafting sweet music the 
lea it is for thee thus swells her heart sighing its message out to thee 
a day or two then bliss unspoilt but oh till then i cannot live he 
had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to 
dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and the coughing of 
the musicians were heard from the gallery pierre was sitting in the drawing room where 
shinshín had engaged him as a man recently returned from abroad in a political conversation 
in which several others joined but which bored pierre when the music began natásha came 
in and walking straight up to pierre said laughing and blushing told me to ask 
you to join the dancers am afraid of mixing the figures pierre replied if you 
will be my teacher and lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender 
little girl while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up pierre sat 
down with his little partner natásha was perfectly happy she was dancing with a grown 
up man who had been abroad she was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking 
to him like a grown up lady she had a fan in her hand that 
one of the ladies had given her to hold assuming quite the pose of a 
society woman heaven knows when and where she had learned it she talked with her 
partner fanning herself and smiling over the fan dear just look at her exclaimed the 
countess as she crossed the ballroom pointing to natásha natásha blushed and laughed really mamma 
why should you what is there to be surprised at in the midst of the 
third écossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room 
where the count and márya dmítrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the 
more distinguished and older visitors they now stretching themselves after sitting so long and replacing 
their purses and pocketbooks entered the ballroom first came márya dmítrievna and the count both 
with merry countenances the count with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style offered his bent 
arm to márya dmítrievna he drew himself up a smile of debonair gallantry lit up 
his face and as soon as the last figure of the écossaise was ended he 
clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery addressing the first 
violin do you know the daniel cooper this was the favorite dance which he had 
danced in his youth strictly speaking daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise at 
papa shouted natásha to the whole company and quite forgetting that she was dancing with 
a grown up partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the 
whole room ring with her laughter and indeed everybody in the room looked with a 
smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout 
partner márya dmítrievna curved his arms beat time straightened his shoulders turned out his toes 
tapped gently with his foot and by a smile that broadened his round face more 
and more prepared the onlookers for what was to follow as soon as the provocatively 
gay strains of daniel cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance began to 
sound all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic men on 
one side and the women on the with beaming faces had come to see their 
master making merry look at the master a regular eagle he is loudly remarked the 
nurse as she stood in one of the doorways the count danced well and knew 
it but his partner could not and did not want to dance well her enormous 
figure stood erect her powerful arms hanging down she had handed her reticule to the 
countess and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance what was 
expressed by the whole of the plump figure in márya dmítrievna found expression only in 
her more and more beaming face and quivering nose but if the count getting more 
and more into the swing of it charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his 
adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet márya 
dmítrievna produced no less impression by slight least effort to move her shoulders or bend 
her arms when turning or stamp her everyone appreciated in view of her size and 
habitual severity the dance grew livelier and livelier the other couples could not attract a 
attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so all were 
watching the count and márya dmítrievna natásha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress urging 
them to at papa though as it was they never took their eyes off the 
couple in the intervals of the dance the count breathing deeply waved and shouted to 
the musicians to play faster faster faster and faster lightly more lightly and yet more 
lightly whirled the count flying round márya dmítrievna now on his toes now on his 
heels until turning his partner round to her seat he executed the final pas raising 
his soft foot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling and making a wide sweep with 
his arm amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by natásha both partners stood 
still breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs how we used to 
dance in our time ma chère said the count was a daniel cooper exclaimed márya 
dmítrievna tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily chapter xxi while in the ballroom the 
sixth anglaise was being danced to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered and 
while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper count bezúkhov had a sixth stroke 
the doctors pronounced recovery impossible after a mute confession communion was administered to the dying 
man preparations made for the sacrament of unction and in his house there was the 
bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments outside the house beyond the gates 
a group of undertakers who hid whenever a carriage drove up waited in expectation of 
an important order for an expensive funeral the military governor of moscow who had been 
assiduous in sending aides de camp to inquire after the health came himself that evening 
to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of court count bezúkhov the magnificent 
reception room was crowded everyone stood up respectfully when the military governor having stayed about 
half an hour alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging their bows and 
trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the 
doctors clergy and relatives of the family prince vasíli who had grown thinner and paler 
during the last few days escorted him to the door repeating something to him several 
times in low tones when the military governor had gone prince vasíli sat down all 
alone on a chair in the ballroom crossing one leg high over the other leaning 
his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand after sitting so 
for a while he rose and looking about him with frightened eyes went with unusually 
hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house to the 
room of the eldest princess those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke 
in nervous whispers and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying room grew 
silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door which creaked 
slightly when opened limits of human life are fixed and may not be said an 
old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening 
naïvely to his words wonder is it not too late to administer unction asked the 
lady adding the clerical title as if she had no opinion of her own on 
the subject madam it is a great sacrament replied the priest passing his hand over 
the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head was that the 
military governor himself was being asked at the other side of the room young looking 
he is and he is over sixty i hear the count no longer recognizes anyone 
they wished to administer the sacrament of unction knew someone who received that sacrament seven 
times the second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from 
weeping and sat down beside dr lorrain who was sitting in a graceful pose under 
a portrait of catherine leaning his elbow on a table said the doctor in answer 
to a remark about the weather weather is beautiful princess and besides in moscow one 
feels as if one were in the country indeed replied the princess with a sigh 
he may have something to drink lorrain considered he taken his medicine the doctor glanced 
at his watch a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of 
tartar and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch has 
neffer been a gase a german doctor was saying to an aide de camp one 
liffs after de sird stroke what a well preserved man he was remarked the aide 
de camp who will inherit his wealth he added in a whisper go begging replied 
the german with a smile everyone again looked toward the door which creaked as the 
second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to instructions the german 
doctor went up to lorrain you think he can last till morning asked the german 
addressing lorrain in french which he pronounced badly lorrain pursing up his lips waved a 
severely negative finger before his nose not later said he in a low voice and 
he moved away with a decorous smile of self satisfaction at being able clearly to 
understand and state the condition meanwhile prince vasíli had opened the door into the room 
in this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning before the 
icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles the room was 
crowded with small pieces of furniture whatnots cupboards and little tables the quilt of a 
high white feather bed was just visible behind a screen a small dog began to 
bark is it you cousin she rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual 
so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head 
and covered with varnish anything happened she asked am so terrified there is no change 
i only came to have a talk about business catiche muttered the prince seating himself 
wearily on the chair she had just vacated have made the place warm i must 
say he remarked sit down have a talk catherine thought perhaps something had happened she 
said with her unchanging stonily severe expression and sitting down opposite the prince she prepared 
to listen wished to get a nap mon cousin but i my dear said prince 
vasíli taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit it was plain 
that this referred to much that they both understood without naming the princess who had 
a straight rigid body abnormally long for her legs looked directly at prince vasíli with 
no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes then she shook her head and 
glanced up at the icons with a sigh this might have been taken as an 
expression of sorrow and devotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long prince 
vasíli understood it as an expression of weariness i he said you think it is 
easier for me i am as worn out as a post horse but still i 
must have a talk with you catiche a very serious talk prince vasíli said no 
more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now on one side now on the 
other giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it 
in a drawing room his eyes too seemed strange at one moment they looked impudently 
sly and at the next glanced round in alarm the princess holding her little dog 
on her lap with her thin bony hands looked attentively into prince eyes evidently resolved 
not to be the first to break silence if she had to wait till morning 
you see my dear princess and cousin catherine semënovna continued prince vasíli returning to his 
theme apparently not without an inner struggle such a moment as this one must think 
of everything one must think of the future of all of you i love you 
all like children of my own as you know the princess continued to look at 
him without moving and with the same dull expression then of course my family has 
also to be considered prince vasíli went on testily pushing away a little table without 
looking at her know catiche that three sisters mámontov and my the only direct heirs 
i know i know how hard it is for you to talk or think of 
such matters it is no easier for me but my dear i am getting on 
for sixty and must be prepared for anything do you know i have sent for 
pierre the count pointing to his portrait demanded that he should be called prince vasíli 
looked questioningly at the princess but could not make out whether she was considering what 
he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him is one thing 
i constantly pray god to grant mon cousin she replied it is that he would 
be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this yes 
of course interrupted prince vasíli impatiently rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward 
him the little table that he had pushed away in short the fact is you 
know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all 
his property not to us his direct heirs but to pierre has made wills enough 
quietly remarked the princess he cannot leave the estate to pierre pierre is illegitimate my 
dear said prince vasíli suddenly clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking 
more rapidly if a letter has been written to the emperor in which the count 
asks for legitimation do you understand that in consideration of the services his request would 
be granted the princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the 
subject under discussion than those they are talking with can tell you more continued prince 
vasíli seizing her hand letter was written though it was not sent and the emperor 
knew of it the only question is has it been destroyed or not if not 
then as soon as all is over and prince vasíli sighed to intimate what he 
meant by the words all is over the papers are opened the will and letter 
will be delivered to the emperor and the petition will certainly be granted pierre will 
get everything as the legitimate son our share asked the princess smiling ironically as if 
anything might happen only not that my poor catiche it is as clear as daylight 
he will then be the legal heir to everything and you get anything you must 
know my dear whether the will and letter were written and whether they have been 
destroyed or not and if they have somehow been overlooked you ought to know where 
they are and must find them because next the princess interrupted smiling sardonically and not 
changing the expression of her eyes am a woman and you think we are all 
stupid but i know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit un bâtard she added as 
if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to prince vasíli the 
invalidity of his contention a bastard really catiche you understand you are so intelligent how 
is it you see that if the count has written a letter to the emperor 
begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate it follows that pierre will not be pierre 
but will become count bezúkhov and will then inherit everything under the will and if 
the will and letter are not destroyed then you will have nothing but the consolation 
of having been dutiful et tout ce qui certain and all that follows therefrom know 
the will was made but i also know that it is invalid and you mon 
cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said the princess with the expression women 
assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging dear princess catherine semënovna 
began prince vasíli impatiently came here not to wrangle with you but to talk about 
your interests as with a kinswoman a good kind true relation and i tell you 
for the tenth time that if the letter to the emperor and the will in 
favor are among the papers then my dear girl you and your sisters are not 
heiresses if you believe me then believe an expert i have just been talking to 
dmítri the family solicitor he says the same at this a sudden change evidently took 
place in the ideas her thin lips grew white though her eyes did not change 
and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself 
evidently did not expect would be a fine thing said she never wanted anything and 
i now she pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress this 
is is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake she cried splendid 
fine i want anything prince but you are not the only one there are your 
sisters replied prince vasíli but the princess did not listen to him i knew it 
long ago but had forgotten i knew that i could expect nothing but meanness deceit 
envy intrigue and blackest this house you or do you not know where that will 
is insisted prince vasíli his cheeks twitching more than ever i was a fool i 
still believed in people loved them and sacrificed myself but only the base the vile 
succeed i know who has been intriguing the princess wished to rise but the prince 
held her by the hand she had the air of one who has suddenly lost 
faith in the whole human race she gave her companion an angry glance is still 
time my dear you must remember catiche that it was all done casually in a 
moment of anger of illness and was afterwards forgotten our duty my dear is to 
rectify his mistake to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice 
and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who sacrificed 
everything for him chimed in the princess who would again have risen had not the 
prince still held her fast he never could appreciate it no mon cousin she added 
with a sigh shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward 
that in this world there is neither honor nor justice in this world one has 
to be cunning and cruel come come be reasonable i know your excellent heart i 
have a wicked heart know your heart repeated the prince value your friendship and wish 
you to have as good an opinion of me upset yourself and let us talk 
sensibly while there is still time be it a day or be it but an 
hour tell me all you know about the will and above all where it is 
you must know we will take it at once and show it to the count 
he has no doubt forgotten it and will wish to destroy it you understand that 
my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes that is my only reason 
for being here i came simply to help him and you i see it all 
i know who has been know cried the princess not the point my dear that 
protégé of yours that sweet princess drubetskáya that anna mikháylovna whom i would not take 
for a housemaid the infamous vile woman not let us lose any time talk to 
me last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile disgraceful 
things about us especially about repeat it made the count quite ill and he would 
not see us for a whole fortnight i know it was then he wrote this 
vile infamous paper but i thought the thing was invalid got to it at did 
you not tell me about it sooner in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under 
his pillow said the princess ignoring his question i know yes if i have a 
sin a great sin it is hatred of that vile woman almost shrieked the princess 
now quite changed what does she come worming herself in here for but i will 
give her a piece of my mind the time will come chapter xxii while these 
conversations were going on in the reception room and the room a carriage containing pierre 
who had been sent for and anna mikháylovna who found it necessary to accompany him 
was driving into the court of count house as the wheels rolled softly over the 
straw beneath the windows anna mikháylovna having turned with words of comfort to her companion 
realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up rousing himself pierre 
followed anna mikháylovna out of the carriage and only then began to think of the 
interview with his dying father which awaited him he noticed that they had not come 
to the front entrance but to the back door while he was getting down from 
the carriage steps two men who looked like tradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and 
hid in the shadow of the wall pausing for a moment pierre noticed several other 
men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides 
but neither anna mikháylovna nor the footman nor the coachman who could not help seeing 
these people took any notice of them seems to be all right pierre concluded and 
followed anna mikháylovna she hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling to pierre 
who was lagging behind to follow though he did not see why it was necessary 
for him to go to the count at all still less why he had to 
go by the back stairs yet judging by anna air of assurance and haste pierre 
concluded that it was all absolutely necessary halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked 
over by some men who carrying pails came running downstairs their boots clattering these men 
pressed close to the wall to let pierre and anna mikháylovna pass and did not 
evince the least surprise at seeing them there this the way to the apartments asked 
anna mikháylovna of one of them replied a footman in a bold loud voice as 
if anything were now permissible door to the left the count did not ask for 
me said pierre when he reached the landing better go to my own room anna 
mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up my friend she said touching his 
arm as she had done her when speaking to him that afternoon me i suffer 
no less than you do but be a man really i better go away he 
asked looking kindly at her over his spectacles my dear friend forget the wrongs that 
may have been done you think that he is your father perhaps in the agony 
of death she sighed have loved you like a son from the first trust yourself 
to me pierre i shall not forget your interests pierre did not understand a word 
but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger and he meekly followed 
anna mikháylovna who was already opening a door this door led into a back anteroom 
an old man a servant of the princesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking 
pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know 
of the existence of these rooms anna mikháylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying past 
with a decanter on a tray as and sweet asked about the health and then 
led pierre along a stone passage the first door on the left led into the 
apartments the maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door everything 
in the house was done in haste at that time and pierre and anna mikháylovna 
in passing instinctively glanced into the room where prince vasíli and the eldest princess were 
sitting close together talking seeing them pass prince vasíli drew back with obvious impatience while 
the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all 
her might this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on 
prince face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly 
over his spectacles at his guide anna mikháylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly 
and sighed as if to say that this was no more than she had expected 
a man my friend i will look after your interests said she in reply to 
his look and went still faster along the passage pierre could not make out what 
it was all about and still less what over his meant but he decided that 
all these things had to be from the passage they went into a large dimly 
lit room adjoining the reception room it was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments 
known to pierre only from the front approach but even in this room there now 
stood an empty bath and water had been spilled on the carpet they were met 
by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe 
without heeding them they went into the reception room familiar to pierre with two italian 
windows opening into the conservatory with its large bust and full length portrait of catherine 
the great the same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as 
before whispering to one another all became silent and turned to look at the pale 
tear worn anna mikháylovna as she entered and at the big stout figure of pierre 
who hanging his head meekly followed her anna face expressed a consciousness that the decisive 
moment had arrived with the air of a practical petersburg lady she now keeping pierre 
close beside her entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon she felt that 
as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see her own 
admission was assured casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing 
the confessor there she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly 
bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessing first of one 
and then of another priest be thanked that you are in time said she to 
one of the priests we relatives have been in such anxiety this young man is 
the son she added more softly a terrible moment having said this she went up 
to the doctor doctor said she young man is the son is there any hope 
the doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders anna mikháylovna with 
just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and 
moved away from the doctor to pierre to him in a particularly respectful and tenderly 
sad voice she said in his mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him 
to sit and wait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone was 
watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it pierre having made up 
his mind to obey his monitress implicitly moved toward the sofa she had indicated as 
soon as anna mikháylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the 
room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed that they 
whispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and 
even servility a deference such as he had never before received was shown him a 
strange lady the one who had been talking to the priests rose and offered him 
her seat an aide de camp picked up and returned a glove pierre had dropped 
the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by and moved to make way for 
him at first pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the 
lady and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors 
who were not even in his way but all at once he felt that this 
would not do and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort 
of awful rite which everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound to 
accept their services he took the glove in silence from the aide de camp and 
sat down in the chair placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the 
naïve attitude of an egyptian statue and decided in his own mind that all was 
as it should be and that in order not to lose his head and do 
foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight but must yield himself 
up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him not two minutes had 
passed before prince vasíli with head erect majestically entered the room he was wearing his 
long coat with three stars on his breast he seemed to have grown thinner since 
the morning his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed pierre 
he went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to do 
and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on 
courage my friend he has asked to see you that is well and he turned 
to go but pierre thought it necessary to ask is and hesitated not knowing whether 
it would be proper to call the dying man count yet ashamed to call him 
had another stroke about half an hour ago courage my friend mind was in such 
a confused state that the word suggested to him a blow from something he looked 
at prince vasíli in perplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack 
of illness prince vasíli said something to lorrain in passing and went through the door 
on tiptoe he could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at 
each step the eldest princess followed him and the priests and deacons and some servants 
also went in at the door through that door was heard a noise of things 
being moved about and at last anna mikháylovna still with the same expression pale but 
resolute in the discharge of duty ran out and touching pierre lightly on the arm 
said divine mercy is inexhaustible unction is about to be administered come pierre went in 
at the door stepping on the soft carpet and noticed that the strange lady the 
aide de camp and some of the servants all followed him in as if there 
were now no further need for permission to enter that room chapter xxiii pierre well 
knew this large room divided by columns and an arch its walls hung round with 
persian carpets the part of the room behind the columns with a high silk curtained 
mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons was 
brightly illuminated with red light like a russian church during evening service under the gleaming 
icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair on snowy white smooth pillows 
evidently freshly changed pierre to the waist by a bright green familiar majestic figure of 
his father count bezúkhov with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which 
reminded one of a lion and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy 
face he lay just under the icons his large thick hands outside the quilt into 
the right hand which was lying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust between 
forefinger and thumb and an old servant bending over from behind the chair held it 
in position by the chair stood the priests their long hair falling over their magnificent 
glittering vestments with lighted tapers in their hands slowly and solemnly conducting the service a 
little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and just 
in front of them their eldest sister catiche with a vicious and determined look steadily 
fixed on the icons as though declaring to all that she could not answer for 
herself should she glance round anna mikháylovna with a meek sorrowful and all forgiving expression 
on her face stood by the door near the strange lady prince vasíli in front 
of the door near the invalid chair a wax taper in his left hand was 
leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned 
round for the purpose and was crossing himself with his right hand turning his eyes 
upward each time he touched his forehead his face wore a calm look of piety 
and resignation to the will of god you do not understand these sentiments he seemed 
to be saying much the worse for you behind him stood the aide de camp 
the doctors and the menservants the men and women had separated as in church all 
were silently crossing themselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chanting of 
deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the 
only sounds that could be heard anna mikháylovna with an air of importance that showed 
that she felt she quite knew what she was about went across the room to 
where pierre was standing and gave him a taper he lit it and distracted by 
observing those around him began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper sophie 
the rosy laughter loving youngest princess with the mole watched him she smiled hid her 
face in her handkerchief and remained with it hidden for awhile then looking up and 
seeing pierre she again began to laugh she evidently felt unable to look at him 
without laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out of temptation 
she slipped quietly behind one of the columns in the midst of the service the 
voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whispered to one another and the old servant 
who was holding the hand got up and said something to the ladies anna mikháylovna 
stepped forward and stooping over the dying man beckoned to lorrain from behind her back 
the french doctor held no taper he was leaning against one of the columns in 
a respectful attitude implying that he a foreigner in spite of all differences of faith 
understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it 
he now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor 
of life with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that 
was free and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment the sick man 
was given something to drink there was a stir around him then the people resumed 
their places and the service continued during this interval pierre noticed that prince vasíli left 
the chair on which he had been leaning an air which intimated that he knew 
what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much 
the worse for not go up to the dying man but passed by him joined 
the eldest princess and moved with her to the side of the room where stood 
the high bedstead with its silken hangings on leaving the bed both prince vasíli and 
the princess passed out by a back door but returned to their places one after 
the other before the service was concluded pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence 
than to the rest of what went on having made up his mind once for 
all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential 
the chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully 
congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament the dying man lay as lifeless 
and immovable as before around him everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers 
among which anna was the most distinct pierre heard her say he must be moved 
onto the bed here it will be impossible the sick man was so surrounded by 
doctors princesses and servants that pierre could no longer see the reddish yellow face with 
its gray though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight of 
for a single moment during the whole service he judged by the cautious movements of 
those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and 
were moving him hold of my arm or drop him he heard one of the 
servants say in a frightened whisper hold from underneath here exclaimed different voices and the 
heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as 
if the weight they were carrying were too much for them as the bearers among 
whom was anna mikháylovna passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their 
heads and backs of the dying high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised by 
those who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curly leonine head 
this head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones its handsome sensual mouth and its 
cold majestic expression was not disfigured by the approach of death it was the same 
as pierre remembered it three months before when the count had sent him to petersburg 
but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers and 
the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing after a few bustle beside the high 
bedstead those who had carried the sick man dispersed anna mikháylovna touched hand and said 
pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid 
in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed he lay with his 
head propped high on the pillows his hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk 
quilt the palms downward when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him 
but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man 
either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must 
look somewhere or it meant too much pierre hesitated not knowing what to do and 
glanced inquiringly at his guide anna mikháylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes glancing 
at the sick hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss 
pierre carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt followed her suggestion 
and pressed his lips to the large boned fleshy hand neither the hand nor a 
single muscle of the face stirred once more pierre looked questioningly at anna mikháylovna to 
see what he was to do next anna mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a chair 
that stood beside the bed pierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were 
doing right anna mikháylovna nodded approvingly again pierre fell into the naïvely symmetrical pose of 
an egyptian statue evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much 
room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible he looked at the 
count who still gazed at the spot where face had been before he sat down 
anna mikháylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last 
moments of meeting between the father and son this lasted about two minutes which to 
pierre seemed an hour suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the face began to 
twitch the twitching increased the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did 
pierre realize how near death his father was and from that distorted mouth issued an 
indistinct hoarse sound anna mikháylovna looked attentively at the sick eyes trying to guess what 
he wanted she pointed first to pierre then to some drink then named prince vasíli 
in an inquiring whisper then pointed to the quilt the eyes and face of the 
sick man showed impatience he made an effort to look at the servant who stood 
constantly at the head of the bed to turn on the other side whispered the 
servant and got up to turn the heavy body toward the wall pierre rose to 
help him while the count was being turned over one of his arms fell back 
helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward whether he noticed the 
look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless arm or whether some other thought 
flitted across his dying brain at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm at 
terror stricken face and again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous 
smile appeared quite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deride his own 
helplessness at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and 
a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed his eyes the sick man was turned 
on to his side with his face to the wall he sighed is dozing said 
anna mikháylovna observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at 
watching us go pierre went out chapter xxiv there was now no one in the 
reception room except prince vasíli and the eldest princess who were sitting under the portrait 
of catherine the great and talking eagerly as soon as they saw pierre and his 
companion they became silent and pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she 
whispered bear the sight of that woman has had tea served in the small drawing 
room said prince vasíli to anna mikháylovna and take something my poor anna mikháylovna or 
you will not hold out to pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a 
sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder pierre went with anna mikháylovna into the small drawing room 
is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious russian 
tea lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea 
from a delicate chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold 
supper were laid in the small circular room around the table all who were at 
count house that night had gathered to fortify themselves pierre well remembered this small circular 
drawing room with its mirrors and little tables during balls given at the house pierre 
who did not know how to dance had liked sitting in this room to watch 
the ladies who as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls 
on their bare shoulders looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their 
reflections several times now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles on one 
small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder and in the middle of 
the night a motley throng of people sat there not merrymaking but somberly whispering and 
betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening 
and what was about to happen in the bedroom pierre did not eat anything though 
he would very much have liked to he looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw 
that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left 
prince vasíli and the eldest princess pierre concluded that this also was essential and after 
a short interval followed her anna mikháylovna was standing beside the princess and they were 
both speaking in excited whispers me princess to know what is necessary and what is 
not necessary said the younger of the two speakers evidently in the same state of 
excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room my dear princess answered 
anna mikháylovna blandly but impressively blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other 
from passing this be too much for poor uncle at a moment when he needs 
repose worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared prince vasíli was 
seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude with one leg crossed high above 
the other his cheeks which were so flabby that they looked heavier below were twitching 
violently but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two 
ladies were saying my dear anna mikháylovna let catiche do as she pleases you know 
how fond the count is of her even know what is in this paper said 
the younger of the two ladies addressing prince vasíli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio 
she held in her hand i know is that his real will is in his 
writing table and this is a paper he has forgotten she tried to pass anna 
mikháylovna but the latter sprang so as to bar her path know my dear kind 
princess said anna mikháylovna seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would 
not let go easily princess i beg and implore you have some pity on him 
je vous en conjure the princess did not reply their efforts in the struggle for 
the portfolio were the only sounds audible but it was evident that if the princess 
did speak her words would not be flattering to anna mikháylovna though the latter held 
on tenaciously her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness my dear come 
here i think he will not be out of place in a family consultation is 
it not so prince you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those 
in the drawing room heard her and were startled do you remain silent when heaven 
knows who permits herself to interfere making a scene on the very threshold of a 
dying room intriguer she hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the portfolio 
but anna mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the 
portfolio and changed her grip prince vasíli rose said he with reproach and surprise is 
absurd come let go i tell you the princess let go you too but anna 
mikháylovna did not obey him go i tell you i will take the responsibility i 
myself will go and ask him i does that satisfy you prince said anna mikháylovna 
such a solemn sacrament allow him a peace here pierre tell them your opinion said 
she turning to the young man who having come quite close was gazing with astonishment 
at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity and at the 
twitching cheeks of prince vasíli that you will answer for the consequences said prince vasíli 
severely know what you are doing woman shouted the princess darting unexpectedly at anna mikháylovna 
and snatching the portfolio from her prince vasíli bent his head and spread out his 
hands at this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so long and which 
had always opened so quietly burst noisily open and banged against the wall and the 
second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands are you doing she cried 
vehemently is dying and you leave me alone with him her sister dropped the portfolio 
anna mikháylovna stooping quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom 
the eldest princess and prince vasíli recovering themselves followed her a few minutes later the 
eldest sister came out with a pale hard face again biting her underlip at sight 
of pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred now you may be glad said she 
is what you have been waiting for and bursting into tears she hid her face 
in her handkerchief and rushed from the room prince vasíli came next he staggered to 
the sofa on which pierre was sitting and dropped onto it covering his face with 
his hand pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook 
as if in an ague my friend said he taking pierre by the elbow and 
there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in it 
before often we sin how much we deceive and all for what i am near 
sixty dear friend i too all will end in death all death is awful and 
he burst into tears anna mikháylovna came out last she approached pierre with slow quiet 
steps she said pierre gave her an inquiring look she kissed the young man on 
his forehead wetting him with her tears then after a pause she said is no 
more pierre looked at her over his spectacles i will go with you try to 
weep nothing gives such relief as tears she led him into the dark drawing room 
and pierre was glad no one could see his face anna mikháylovna left him and 
when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm in the 
morning anna mikháylovna said to pierre my dear this is a great loss for us 
all not to speak of you but god will support you you are young and 
are now i hope in command of an immense fortune the will has not yet 
been opened i know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn 
your head but it imposes duties on you and you must be a man pierre 
was silent later on i may tell you my dear boy that if i had 
not been there god only knows what would have happened you know uncle promised me 
only the day before yesterday not to forget borís but he had no time i 
hope my dear friend you will carry out your wish pierre understood nothing of all 
this and coloring shyly looked in silence at princess anna mikháylovna after her talk with 
pierre anna mikháylovna returned to the and went to bed on waking in the morning 
she told the rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details of count death she said 
the count had died as she would herself wish to die that his end was 
not only touching but edifying as to the last meeting between father and son it 
was so touching that she could not think of it without tears and did not 
know which had behaved better during those awful father who so remembered everything and everybody 
at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son or pierre whom it 
had been pitiful to see so stricken was he with grief though he tried hard 
to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father is painful but it 
does one good it uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count 
and his worthy son said she of the behavior of the eldest princess and prince 
vasíli she spoke disapprovingly but in whispers and as a great secret chapter xxv at 
bald hills prince nicholas andréevich estate the arrival of young prince andrew and his wife 
was daily expected but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in 
the old household general in chief prince nicholas andréevich nicknamed in society king of ever 
since the emperor paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously 
with his daughter princess mary and her companion mademoiselle bourienne though in the new reign 
he was free to return to the capitals he still continued to live in the 
country remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from 
moscow to bald hills while he himself needed no one and nothing he used to 
say that there are only two sources of human and superstition and only two and 
intelligence he himself undertook his education and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her 
gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty and arranged her life 
so that her whole time was occupied he was himself always occupied writing his memoirs 
solving problems in higher mathematics turning snuffboxes on a lathe working in the garden or 
superintending the building that was always going on at his estate as regularity is a 
prime condition facilitating activity regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of 
exactitude he always came to table under precisely the same conditions and not only at 
the same hour but at the same minute with those about him from his daughter 
to his serfs the prince was sharp and invariably exacting so that without being a 
hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused 
although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs every high 
official appointed to the province in which the estate lay considered it his duty to 
visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect gardener or princess 
mary did till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour everyone sitting in this 
antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study 
door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man with powdered wig 
small withered hands and bushy gray eyebrows which when he frowned sometimes hid the gleam 
of his shrewd youthfully glittering eyes on the morning of the day that the young 
couple were to arrive princess mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed 
for the morning greeting crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer every morning 
she came in like that and every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass 
off well an old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly and 
said in a whisper walk in through the door came the regular hum of a 
lathe the princess timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily she paused at 
the entrance the prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his 
work the enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use the large table 
covered with books and plans the tall glass fronted bookcases with keys in the locks 
the high desk for writing while standing up on which lay an open exercise book 
and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered indicated continuous varied 
and orderly activity the motion of the small foot shod in a tartar boot embroidered 
with silver and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand showed that the prince 
still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age after a few more 
turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal wiped his chisel dropped 
it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe and approaching the table summoned his 
daughter he never gave his children a blessing so he simply held out his bristly 
cheek as yet unshaven and regarding her tenderly and attentively said severely well all right 
then sit down he took the exercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself 
and drew up a chair with his foot tomorrow said he quickly finding the page 
and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail the princess 
bent over the exercise book on the table a bit a letter for you said 
the old man suddenly taking a letter addressed in a hand from a bag hanging 
above the table onto which he threw it at the sight of the letter red 
patches showed themselves on the face she took it quickly and bent her head over 
it héloïse asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still sound yellowish 
teeth from julie replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid smile let 
two more letters pass but the third read said the prince sternly afraid you write 
much nonsense read the third this if you like father said the princess blushing still 
more and holding out the letter third i said the third cried the prince abruptly 
pushing the letter away and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him 
the exercise book containing geometrical figures madam he began stooping over the book close to 
his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she 
sat so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of 
old age and tobacco which she had known so long madam these triangles are equal 
please note that the angle abc the princess looked in a scared way at her 
eyes glittering close to her the red patches on her face came and went and 
it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would 
prevent her understanding any of her further explanations however clear they might be whether it 
was the fault or the this same thing happened every day the eyes grew dim 
she could not see and could not hear anything but was only conscious of her 
stern withered face close to her of his breath and the smell of him and 
could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make 
out the problem in peace the old man was beside himself moved the chair on 
which he was sitting noisily backward and forward made efforts to control himself and not 
become vehement but almost always did become vehement scolded and sometimes flung the exercise book 
away the princess gave a wrong answer now she a fool shouted the prince pushing 
the book aside and turning sharply away but rising immediately he paced up and down 
lightly touched his hair and sat down again he drew up his chair and continued 
to explain do princess it do said he when princess mary having taken and closed 
the exercise book with the next lesson was about to leave are most important madam 
i want to have you like our silly ladies get used to it and like 
it and he patted her cheek will drive all the nonsense out of your head 
she turned to go but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut 
book from the high desk is some sort of key to the mysteries that your 
héloïse has sent you religious i interfere with belief i have looked at it take 
it well now go go he patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the 
door after her princess mary went back to her room with the sad scared expression 
that rarely left her and which made her plain sickly face yet plainer she sat 
down at her writing table on which stood miniature portraits and which was littered with 
books and papers the princess was as untidy as her father was tidy she put 
down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter it was from 
her most intimate friend from childhood that same julie karágina who had been at the 
name day party julie wrote in french dear and precious friend how terrible and frightful 
a thing is separation though i tell myself that half my life and half my 
happiness are wrapped up in you and that in spite of the distance separating us 
our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds my heart rebels against fate and in spite 
of the pleasures and distractions around me i cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that 
has been in my heart ever since we parted why are we not together as 
we were last summer in your big study on the blue sofa the confidential sofa 
why cannot i now as three months ago draw fresh moral strength from your look 
so gentle calm and penetrating a look i loved so well and seem to see 
before me as i write having read thus far princess mary sighed and glanced into 
the mirror which stood on her right it reflected a weak ungraceful figure and thin 
face her eyes always sad now looked with particular hopelessness at her reflection in the 
glass flatters me thought the princess turning away and continuing to read but julie did 
not flatter her friend the deep and luminous it seemed as if at times there 
radiated from them shafts of warm light so beautiful that very often in spite of 
the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of 
beauty but the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own look they had 
when she was not thinking of herself as with everyone her face assumed a forced 
unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass she went on reading all 
moscow talks of nothing but war one of my two brothers is already abroad the 
other is with the guards who are starting on their march to the frontier our 
dear emperor has left petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person 
to the chances of war god grant that the corsican monster who is destroying the 
peace of europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the almighty 
in his goodness to give us as sovereign to say nothing of my brothers this 
war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart i mean young 
nicholas rostóv who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left 
the university to join the army i will confess to you dear mary that in 
spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great grief to 
me this young man of whom i spoke to you last summer is so noble 
minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old 
men of twenty and particularly he is so frank and has so much heart he 
is so pure and poetic that my relations with him transient as they were have 
been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart which has already suffered so 
much someday i will tell you about our parting and all that was said then 
that is still too fresh ah dear friend you are happy not to know these 
poignant joys and sorrows you are fortunate for the latter are generally the stronger i 
know very well that count nicholas is too young ever to be more to me 
than a friend but this sweet friendship this poetic and pure intimacy were what my 
heart needed but enough of this the chief news about which all moscow gossips is 
the death of old count bezúkhov and his inheritance fancy the three princesses have received 
very little prince vasíli nothing and it is monsieur pierre who has inherited all the 
property and has besides been recognized as legitimate so that he is now count bezúkhov 
and possessor of the finest fortune in russia it is rumored that prince vasíli played 
a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to petersburg quite crestfallen 
i confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance but 
i do know that since this young man whom we all used to know as 
plain monsieur pierre has become count bezúkhov and the owner of one of the largest 
fortunes in russia i am much amused to watch the change in the tone and 
manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters and of the young ladies themselves toward 
him though between you and me he always seemed to me a poor sort of 
fellow as for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for 
me most of whom i even know the matchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of 
me as the future countess bezúkhova but you will understand that i have no desire 
for the post à propos of marriages do you know that a while ago that 
universal auntie anna mikháylovna told me under the seal of strict secrecy of a plan 
of marriage for you it is neither more nor less than with prince son anatole 
whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguée and it 
is on you that his choice has fallen i know what you will think of 
it but i consider it my duty to let you know of it he is 
said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace that is all i have been 
able to find out about him but enough of gossip i am at the end 
of my second sheet of paper and mamma has sent for me to go and 
dine at the read the mystical book i am sending you it has an enormous 
success here though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to 
grasp it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul adieu give my 
respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to mademoiselle bourienne i embrace you as 
i love you julie p s let me have news of your brother and his 
charming little wife the princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes 
lit up so that her face was entirely transformed then she suddenly rose and with 
her heavy tread went up to the table she took a sheet of paper and 
her hand moved rapidly over it this is the reply she wrote also in french 
dear and precious friend your letter of the 13th has given me great delight so 
you still love me my romantic julie separation of which you say so much that 
is bad does not seem to have had its usual effect on you you complain 
of our separation what then should i say if i dared complain i who am 
deprived of all who are dear to me ah if we had not religion to 
console us life would be very sad why do you suppose that i should look 
severely on your affection for that young man on such matters i am only severe 
with myself i understand such feelings in others and if never having felt them i 
cannot approve of them neither do i condemn them only it seems to me that 
christian love love of neighbor love of enemy is worthier sweeter and better than the 
feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and 
loving young girl like yourself the news of count death reached us before your letter 
and my father was much affected by it he says the count was the last 
representative but one of the great century and that it is his own turn now 
but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late 
as possible god preserve us from that terrible misfortune i cannot agree with you about 
pierre whom i knew as a child he always seemed to me to have an 
excellent heart and that is the quality i value most in people as to his 
inheritance and the part played by prince vasíli it is very sad for both ah 
my dear friend our divine words that it is easier for a camel to go 
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom 
of god are terribly true i pity prince vasíli but am still more sorry for 
pierre so young and burdened with such what temptations he will be exposed if i 
were asked what i desire most on earth it would be to be poorer than 
the poorest beggar a thousand thanks dear friend for the volume you have sent me 
and which has such success in moscow yet since you tell me that among some 
good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp it seems to 
me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear 
no fruit i never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds 
by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination giving 
them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to christian simplicity let us rather read the 
epistles and gospels let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain for how 
can we miserable sinners that we are know the terrible and holy secrets of providence 
while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the 
eternal let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine saviour 
has left for our guidance here below let us try to conform to them and 
follow them and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human 
minds roam the better we shall please god who rejects all knowledge that does not 
come from him and the less we seek to fathom what he has been pleased 
to conceal from us the sooner will he vouchsafe its revelation to us through his 
divine spirit my father has not spoken to me of a suitor but has only 
told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince 
vasíli in regard to this project of marriage for me i will tell you dear 
sweet friend that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must 
conform however painful it may be to me should the almighty lay the duties of 
wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them as faithfully as i 
can without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom he may give me 
for husband i have had a letter from my brother who announces his speedy arrival 
at bald hills with his wife this pleasure will be but a brief one however 
for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which 
we have been drawn god knows how or why not only where you the heart 
of affairs and of the the talk all of war even here amid fieldwork and 
the calm of townsfolk consider characteristic of the of war are heard and painfully felt 
my father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches things of which i understand nothing 
and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village i witnessed a 
heartrending scene it was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to 
join the army you should have seen the state of the mothers wives and children 
of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs it seems as 
though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine saviour who preached love and forgiveness 
of that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another adieu dear 
and kind friend may our divine saviour and his most holy mother keep you in 
their holy and all powerful care mary you are sending off a letter princess i 
have already dispatched mine i have written to my poor mother said the smiling mademoiselle 
bourienne rapidly in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural she brought into princess strenuous 
mournful and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere careless lighthearted and self satisfied i must 
warn you she added lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure and 
speaking with exaggerated grasseyement prince has been scolding michael ivánovich he is in a very 
bad humor very morose be prepared dear friend replied princess mary have asked you never 
to warn me of the humor my father is in i do not allow myself 
to judge him and would not have others do so the princess glanced at her 
watch and seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the 
clavichord went into the sitting room with a look of alarm between twelve and two 
as the day was mapped out the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord 
chapter xxvi the gray haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the 
prince who was in his large study from the far side of the house through 
the closed doors came the sound of difficult times a sonata by dussek just then 
a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch prince andrew 
got out of the carriage helped his little wife to alight and let her pass 
into the house before him old tíkhon wearing a wig put his head out of 
the door of the antechamber reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping and 
hastily closed the door tíkhon knew that neither the arrival nor any other unusual event 
must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day prince andrew apparently knew 
this as well as tíkhon he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether 
his habits had changed since he was at home last and having assured himself that 
they had not he turned to his wife will get up in twenty minutes let 
us go across to room he said the little princess had grown stouter during this 
time but her eyes and her short downy smiling lip lifted when she began to 
speak just as merrily and prettily as ever this is a palace she said to 
her husband looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a 
ball come quick quick and with a glance round she smiled at tíkhon at her 
husband and at the footman who accompanied them that mary practicing go quietly and take 
her by surprise prince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression grown older 
tíkhon he said in passing to the old man who kissed his hand before they 
reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came the pretty fair haired 
frenchwoman mademoiselle bourienne rushed out apparently beside herself with delight what joy for the princess 
exclaimed she last i must let her know no please not you are mademoiselle bourienne 
said the little princess kissing her know you already through my sister in friendship for 
you she was not expecting us they went up to the door of the sitting 
room from which came the sound of the oft repeated passage of the sonata prince 
andrew stopped and made a grimace as if expecting something unpleasant the little princess entered 
the room the passage broke off in the middle a cry was heard then princess 
heavy tread and the sound of kissing when prince andrew went in the two princesses 
who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding were in 
each arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch mademoiselle bourienne 
stood near them pressing her hand to her heart with a beatific smile and obviously 
equally ready to cry or to laugh prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned as 
lovers of music do when they hear a false note the two women let go 
of one another and then as if afraid of being too late seized each hands 
kissing them and pulling them away and again began kissing each other on the face 
and then to prince surprise both began to cry and kissed again mademoiselle bourienne also 
began to cry prince andrew evidently felt ill at ease but to the two women 
it seemed quite natural that they should cry and apparently it never entered their heads 
that it could have been otherwise at this meeting my dear ah mary they suddenly 
exclaimed and then laughed dreamed last night were not expecting us mary you have got 
thinner you have grown stouter knew the princess at once put in mademoiselle bourienne i 
had no idea exclaimed princess mary andrew i did not see you prince andrew and 
his sister hand in hand kissed one another and he told her she was still 
the same crybaby as ever princess mary had turned toward her brother and through her 
tears the loving warm gentle look of her large luminous eyes very beautiful at that 
moment rested on prince face the little princess talked incessantly her short downy upper lip 
continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next 
moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes she 
told of an accident they had had on the spásski hill which might have been 
serious for her in her condition and immediately after that informed them that she had 
left all her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to 
dress in here and that andrew had quite changed and that kitty odýntsova had married 
an old man and that there was a suitor for mary a real one but 
that they would talk of that later princess mary was still looking silently at her 
brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness it was plain that 
she was following a train of thought independent of her sister in words in the 
midst of a description of the last petersburg fete she addressed her brother you are 
really going to the war andrew she said sighing lise sighed too and even tomorrow 
replied her brother is leaving me here god knows why when he might have had 
promotion princess mary did not listen to the end but continuing her train of thought 
turned to her sister in law with a tender glance at her figure it certain 
she said the face of the little princess changed she sighed and said quite certain 
ah it is very dreadful her lip descended she brought her face close to her 
sister in and unexpectedly again began to cry needs rest said prince andrew with a 
frown you lise take her to your room and go to father how is he 
just the same just the same though i know what your opinion will be answered 
the princess joyfully are the hours the same and the walks in the avenues and 
the lathe asked prince andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that in spite 
of all his love and respect for his father he was aware of his weaknesses 
hours are the same and the lathe and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons 
said princess mary gleefully as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights 
of her life when the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for 
the old prince to get up tíkhon came to call the young prince to his 
father the old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his 
arrival he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner 
the old prince always dressed in old fashioned style wearing an antique coat and powdered 
hair and when prince andrew entered his dressing room not with the contemptuous look and 
manner he wore in drawing rooms but with the animated face with which he talked 
to pierre the old man was sitting on a large leather covered chair wrapped in 
a powdering mantle entrusting his head to tíkhon the warrior wants to vanquish buonaparte said 
the old man shaking his powdered head as much as the tail which tíkhon was 
holding fast to plait would allow at least must tackle him properly or else if 
he goes on like this soon have us too for his subjects how are you 
and he held out his cheek the old man was in a good temper after 
his nap before dinner he used to say that a nap dinner was dinner golden 
he cast happy sidelong glances at his son from under his thick bushy eyebrows prince 
andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him he made 
no reply on his favorite fun of the military men of the day and more 
particularly of bonaparte father i have come to you and brought my wife who is 
pregnant said prince andrew following every movement of his face with an eager and respectful 
look is your health fools and rakes fall ill my boy you know me i 
am busy from morning till night and abstemious so of course i am well god 
said his son smiling has nothing to do with it well go on he continued 
returning to his hobby me how the germans have taught you to fight bonaparte by 
this new science you call prince andrew smiled me time to collect my wits father 
said he with a smile that showed that his foibles did not prevent his son 
from loving and honoring him i have not yet had time to settle down nonsense 
cried the old man shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited and 
grasping his by the hand house for your wife is ready princess mary will take 
her there and show her over and talk nineteen to the dozen their way i 
am glad to have her sit down and talk about army i too a simultaneous 
expedition but the southern army to do prussia is neutral i know that what about 
austria said he rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed 
by tíkhon who ran after him handing him different articles of clothing of sweden how 
will they cross pomerania prince andrew seeing that his father insisted first reluctantly but gradually 
with more and more animation and from habit changing unconsciously from russian to french as 
he went explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign he explained how an 
army ninety thousand strong was to threaten prussia so as to bring her out of 
her neutrality and draw her into the war how part of that army was to 
join some swedish forces at stralsund how two hundred and twenty thousand austrians with a 
hundred thousand russians were to operate in italy and on the rhine how fifty thousand 
russians and as many english were to land at naples and how a total force 
of five hundred thousand men was to attack the french from different sides the old 
prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation but as if he were 
not listening to it continued to dress while walking about and three times unexpectedly interrupted 
once he stopped it by shouting white one the white one this meant that tíkhon 
was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted another time he interrupted saying will she 
soon be confined and shaking his head reproachfully said bad go on go on the 
third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his description the old man began to 
sing in the cracked voice of old age va t en guerre dieu sait quand 
reviendra is going to the wars god knows when return his son only smiled say 
a plan i approve of said the son am only telling you what it is 
napoleon has also formed his plan by now not worse than this one told me 
nothing new and the old man repeated meditatively and rapidly sait quand reviendra go to 
the dining room chapter xxvii at the appointed hour the prince powdered and shaven entered 
the dining room where his daughter in law princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne were already 
awaiting him together with his architect who by a strange caprice of his was admitted 
to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not 
have caused him to expect that honor the prince who generally kept very strictly to 
social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table had unexpectedly selected 
michael ivánovich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked 
handkerchief to illustrate the theory that all men are equals and had more than once 
impressed on his daughter that michael ivánovich was a whit worse than you or i 
at dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn michael ivánovich more often than to 
anyone else in the dining room which like all the rooms in the house was 
exceedingly lofty the members of the household and the behind each waiting for the prince 
to enter the head butler napkin on arm was scanning the setting of the table 
making signs to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by 
which the prince was to enter prince andrew was looking at a large gilt frame 
new to him containing the genealogical tree of the princes bolkónski opposite which hung another 
such frame with a badly painted portrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging 
to the estate of a ruling prince in a alleged descendant of rúrik and ancestor 
of the bolkónskis prince andrew looking again at that genealogical tree shook his head laughing 
as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as 
to be amusing thoroughly like him that is he said to princess mary who had 
come up to him princess mary looked at her brother in surprise she did not 
understand what he was laughing at everything her father did inspired her with reverence and 
was beyond question has his heel continued prince andrew with his powerful mind indulging in 
such nonsense princess mary could not understand the boldness of her criticism and was about 
to reply when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study the prince walked 
in quickly and jauntily as was his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of 
his manners with the strict formality of his house at that moment the great clock 
struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room the 
prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from under their thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned 
all present and rested on the little princess she felt as courtiers do when the 
tsar enters the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all 
around him he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of 
her neck glad glad to see you he said looking attentively into her eyes and 
then quickly went to his place and sat down down sit down sit down michael 
ivánovich he indicated a place beside him to his daughter in law a footman moved 
the chair for her ho said the old man casting his eyes on her rounded 
figure been in a hurry bad he laughed in his usual dry cold unpleasant way 
with his lips only and not with his eyes must walk walk as much as 
possible as much as possible he said the little princess did not or did not 
wish to hear his words she was silent and seemed confused the prince asked her 
about her father and she began to smile and talk he asked about mutual acquaintances 
and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people 
and retelling the town gossip apráksina poor thing has lost her husband and she has 
cried her eyes out she said growing more and more lively as she became animated 
the prince looked at her more and more sternly and suddenly as if he had 
studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her he turned away and 
addressed michael ivánovich michael ivánovich our bonaparte will be having a bad time of it 
prince he always spoke thus of his son been telling me what forces are being 
collected against him while you and i never thought much of him michael ivánovich did 
not at all know when and had said such things about bonaparte but understanding that 
he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the favorite topic he looked 
inquiringly at the young prince wondering what would follow is a great tactician said the 
prince to his son pointing to the architect and the conversation again turned on the 
war on bonaparte and the generals and statesmen of the day the old prince seemed 
convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did 
not know the a b c of war or of politics and that bonaparte was 
an insignificant little frenchy successful only because there were no longer any potëmkins or suvórovs 
left to oppose him but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties 
in europe and no real war but only a sort of puppet show at which 
the men of the day were playing pretending to do something real prince andrew gaily 
bore with his ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to 
him with evident pleasure past always seems good said he did not suvórov himself fall 
into a trap moreau set him and from which he did not know how to 
escape told you that who cried the prince and he jerked away his plate which 
tíkhon briskly caught consider prince andrew two frederick and suvórov moreau moreau would have been 
a prisoner if suvórov had had a free hand but he had the hofs kriegs 
wurst schnapps rath on his hands it would have puzzled the devil himself when you 
get there find out what those hofs kriegs wurst raths are suvórov manage them so 
what chance has michael kutúzov no my dear boy he continued and your generals get 
on against buonaparte have to call in the french so that birds of a feather 
may fight together the german pahlen has been sent to new york in america to 
fetch the frenchman moreau he said alluding to the invitation made that year to moreau 
to enter the russian service were the potëmkins suvórovs and orlóvs germans no lad either 
you fellows have all lost your wits or i have outlived mine may god help 
you but see what will happen buonaparte has become a great commander among them hm 
at all say that all the plans are good said prince andrew am only surprised 
at your opinion of bonaparte you may laugh as much as you like but all 
the same bonaparte is a great general ivánovich cried the old prince to the architect 
who busy with his roast meat hoped he had been forgotten i tell you buonaparte 
was a great tactician here he says the same thing be sure your excellency replied 
the architect the prince again laughed his frigid laugh was born with a silver spoon 
in his mouth he has got splendid soldiers besides he began by attacking germans and 
only idlers have failed to beat the germans since the world began everybody has beaten 
the germans they beat no one another he made his reputation fighting them and the 
prince began explaining all the blunders which according to him bonaparte had made in his 
campaigns and even in politics his son made no rejoinder but it was evident that 
whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his 
opinion he listened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how this old man living 
alone in the country for so many years could know and discuss so minutely and 
acutely all the recent european military and political events think an old man and understand 
the present state of affairs concluded his father it troubles me i sleep at night 
come now where has this great commander of yours shown his skill he concluded would 
take too long to tell answered the son then go off to your buonaparte mademoiselle 
bourienne another admirer of that powder monkey emperor of yours he exclaimed in excellent french 
know prince i am not a bonapartist sait quand reviendra hummed the prince out of 
tune and with a laugh still more so he quitted the table the little princess 
during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent glancing with a 
frightened look now at her father in law and now at princess mary when they 
left the table she took her sister in arm and drew her into another room 
a clever man your father is said she that is why i am afraid of 
him he is so kind answered princess mary chapter xxviii prince andrew was to leave 
next evening the old prince not altering his routine retired as usual after dinner the 
little princess was in her sister in room prince andrew in a traveling coat without 
epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him after inspecting 
the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in he ordered the horses to be 
harnessed only those things he always kept with him remained in his room a small 
box a large canteen fitted with silver plate two turkish pistols and a present from 
his father who had brought it from the siege of ochákov all these traveling effects 
of prince were in very good order new clean and in cloth covers carefully tied 
with tapes when starting on a journey or changing their mode of life men capable 
of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind at such moments one reviews 
the past and plans for the future prince face looked very thoughtful and tender with 
his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room looking 
straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head did he fear going to the war 
or was he sad at leaving his wife both but evidently he did not wish 
to be seen in that mood for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped 
his hands stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box 
and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression it was the heavy tread of princess 
mary that he heard hear you have given orders to harness she cried panting she 
had apparently been running i did so wish to have another talk with you alone 
god knows how long we may again be parted you are not angry with me 
for coming you have changed so andrúsha she added as if to explain such a 
question she smiled as she uttered his pet name it was obviously strange to her 
to think that this stern handsome man should be slender mischievous boy who had been 
her playfellow in childhood where is lise he asked answering her question only by a 
smile was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room 
oh andrew what a treasure of a wife you have said she sitting down on 
the sofa facing her brother is quite a child such a dear merry child i 
have grown so fond of her prince andrew was silent but the princess noticed the 
ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face must be indulgent to little 
weaknesses who is free from them andrew forget that she has grown up and been 
educated in society and so her position now is not a rosy one we should 
enter into situation tout comprendre tout pardonner think what it must be for her poor 
thing after what she has been used to to be parted from her husband and 
be left alone in the country in her condition very hard to understand all is 
to forgive all prince andrew smiled as he looked at his sister as we smile 
at those we think we thoroughly understand live in the country and think the life 
terrible he replied different why speak of me i want any other life and for 
i know no other but think andrew for a young society woman to be buried 
in the country during the best years of her life all papa is always busy 
and i well you know what poor resources i have for entertaining a woman used 
to the best society there is only mademoiselle bourienne like your mademoiselle bourienne at all 
said prince andrew she is very nice and kind and above all much to be 
pitied she has no one no one to tell the truth i need her and 
even in my way you know i always was a savage and now am even 
more so i like being alone father likes her very much she and michael ivánovich 
are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind because he has 
been a benefactor to them both as sterne says love people so much for the 
good they have done us as for the good we have done them father took 
her when she was homeless after losing her own father she is very good natured 
and my father likes her way of reading she reads to him in the evenings 
and reads splendidly be quite frank mary i expect character sometimes makes things trying for 
you it prince andrew asked suddenly princess mary was first surprised and then aghast at 
this question me for me trying for me said she always was rather harsh and 
now i should think getting very trying said prince andrew apparently speaking lightly of their 
father in order to puzzle or test his sister are good in every way andrew 
but you have a kind of intellectual pride said the princess following the train of 
her own thoughts rather than the trend of the a great sin how can one 
judge father but even if one might what feeling except veneration could such a man 
as my father evoke and i am so contented and happy with him i only 
wish you were all as happy as i am her brother shook his head incredulously 
only thing that is hard for me i will tell you the truth andrew is 
way of treating religious subjects i understand how a man of his immense intellect can 
fail to see what is as clear as day and can go so far astray 
that is the only thing that makes me unhappy but even in this i can 
see lately a shade of improvement his satire has been less bitter of late and 
there was a monk he received and had a long talk with my dear i 
am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder said prince andrew banteringly yet 
tenderly mon ami i only pray and hope that god will hear me andrew she 
said timidly after a silence have a great favor to ask of you is it 
dear that you will not refuse it will give you no trouble and is nothing 
unworthy of you but it will comfort me promise andrúsha said she putting her hand 
in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it as 
if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown 
before the request was granted she looked timidly at her brother if it were a 
great deal of trouble answered prince andrew as if guessing what it was about what 
you please i know you are just like father think as you please but do 
this for my sake please do father our grandfather wore it in all his wars 
she still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule you promise 
course what is it i bless you with this icon and you must promise me 
you will never take it off do you promise it does not weigh a hundredweight 
and break my neck to please you said prince andrew but immediately noticing the pained 
expression his joke had brought to his face he repented and added am glad really 
dear i am very glad your will he will save and have mercy on you 
and bring you to himself for in him alone is truth and peace said she 
in a voice trembling with emotion solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother 
a small oval antique dark faced icon of the saviour in a gold setting on 
a finely wrought silver chain she crossed herself kissed the icon and handed it to 
andrew andrew for my sake rays of gentle light shone from her large timid eyes 
those eyes lit up the whole of her thin sickly face and made it beautiful 
her brother would have taken the icon but she stopped him andrew understood crossed himself 
and kissed the icon there was a look of tenderness for he was touched but 
also a gleam of irony on his face you my dear she kissed him on 
the forehead and sat down again on the sofa they were silent for a while 
i was saying to you andrew be kind and generous as you always used to 
be judge lise harshly she began is so sweet so good natured and her position 
now is a very hard one do not think i have complained of my wife 
to you másha or blamed her why do you say all this to me red 
patches appeared on princess face and she was silent as if she felt guilty have 
said nothing to you but you have already been talked to and i am sorry 
for that he went on the patches grew deeper on her forehead neck and cheeks 
she tried to say something but could not her brother had guessed right the little 
princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement 
and how she dreaded it and had complained of her fate her father in law 
and her husband after crying she had fallen asleep prince andrew felt sorry for his 
sister this másha i reproach have not reproached and never shall reproach my wife with 
anything and i cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her and that always 
will be so in whatever circumstances i may be placed but if you want to 
know the truth if you want to know whether i am happy no is she 
happy no but why this is so i know as he said this he rose 
went to his sister and stooping kissed her forehead his fine eyes lit up with 
a thoughtful kindly and unaccustomed brightness but he was looking not at his sister but 
over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway us go to her i 
must say good by and wake and come in a moment petrúshka he called to 
his valet here take these away put this on the seat and this to the 
right princess mary rose and moved to the door then stopped and said if you 
had faith you would have turned to god and asked him to give you the 
love you do not feel and your prayer would have been answered maybe said prince 
andrew másha come immediately on the way to his room in the passage which connected 
one wing with the other prince andrew met mademoiselle bourienne smiling sweetly it was the 
third time that day that with an ecstatic and artless smile she had met him 
in secluded passages i thought you were in your room she said for some reason 
blushing and dropping her eyes prince andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of 
anger suddenly came over his face he said nothing to her but looked at her 
forehead and hair without looking at her eyes with such contempt that the frenchwoman blushed 
and went away without a word when he reached his room his wife was already 
awake and her merry voice hurrying one word after another came through the open door 
she was speaking as usual in french and as if after long self restraint she 
wished to make up for lost time but imagine the old countess zúbova with false 
curls and her mouth full of false teeth as if she were trying to cheat 
old age ha ha ha mary this very sentence about countess zúbova and this same 
laugh prince andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some 
five times he entered the room softly the little princess plump and rosy was sitting 
in an easy chair with her work in her hands talking incessantly repeating petersburg reminiscences 
and even phrases prince andrew came up stroked her hair and asked if she felt 
rested after their journey she answered him and continued her chatter the coach with six 
horses was waiting at the porch it was an autumn night so dark that the 
coachman could not see the carriage pole servants with lanterns were bustling about in the 
porch the immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows the domestic 
serfs were crowding in the hall waiting to bid good by to the young prince 
the members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall michael ivánovich mademoiselle 
bourienne princess mary and the little princess prince andrew had been called to his study 
as the latter wished to say good by to him alone all were waiting for 
them to come out when prince andrew entered the study the old man in his 
old age spectacles and white dressing gown in which he received no one but his 
son sat at the table writing he glanced round and he went on writing come 
to say good by me here and he touched his cheek thanks do you thank 
me for not dilly dallying and not hanging to a apron strings the service before 
everything thanks thanks and he went on writing so that his quill spluttered and squeaked 
you have anything to say say it these two things can be done together he 
added my wife i am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands 
talk nonsense say what you want her confinement is due send to moscow for an 
accoucheur let him be here the old prince stopped writing and as if not understanding 
fixed his stern eyes on his son know that no one can help if nature 
does not do her work said prince andrew evidently confused know that out of a 
million cases only one goes wrong but it is her fancy and mine they have 
been telling her things she has had a dream and is frightened hm muttered the 
old prince to himself finishing what he was writing do it he signed with a 
flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh a bad business eh is 
bad father wife said the old prince briefly and significantly understand said prince andrew it 
be helped lad said the prince all like that one unmarry be afraid i tell 
anyone but you know it yourself he seized his son by the hand with small 
bony fingers shook it looked straight into his face with keen eyes which seemed to 
see through him and again laughed his frigid laugh the son sighed thus admitting that 
his father had understood him the old man continued to fold and seal his letter 
snatching up and throwing down the wax the seal and the paper with his accustomed 
rapidity to be done pretty i will do everything make your mind easy said he 
in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter andrew did not speak he was both pleased 
and displeased that his father understood him the old man got up and gave the 
letter to his son said he worry about your wife what can be done shall 
be now listen give this letter to michael ilariónovich i have written that he should 
make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant 
a bad position tell him i remember and like him write and tell me how 
he receives you if he is all him nicholas son need not serve under anyone 
if he is in disfavor now come here kutúzov he spoke so rapidly that he 
did not finish half his words but his son was accustomed to understand him he 
led him to the desk raised the lid drew out a drawer and took out 
an exercise book filled with his bold tall close handwriting shall probably die before you 
so remember these are my memoirs hand them to the emperor after my death now 
here is a lombard bond and a letter it is a premium for the man 
who writes a history of wars send it to the academy here are some jottings 
for you to read when i am gone you will find them useful andrew did 
not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet he 
felt that he must not say it will do it all father he said now 
good by he gave his son his hand to kiss and embraced him this prince 
andrew if they kill you it will hurt me your old father he paused unexpectedly 
and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked if i hear that you have not 
behaved like a son of nicholas bolkónski i shall be ashamed need not have said 
that to me father said the son with a smile the old man was silent 
also wanted to ask you continued prince andrew killed and if i have a son 
do not let him be taken away from i said yesterday let him grow up 
with you please let the wife have him said the old man and laughed they 
stood silent facing one another the old sharp eyes were fixed straight on his something 
twitched in the lower part of the old face said good by go he suddenly 
shouted in a loud angry voice opening his door is it what asked both princesses 
when they saw for a moment at the door prince andrew and the figure of 
the old man in a white dressing gown spectacled and wigless shouting in an angry 
voice prince andrew sighed and made no reply he said turning to his wife and 
this sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying go through your performance already said 
the little princess turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband he embraced her 
she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned 
on looked into her face and carefully placed her in an easy chair mary said 
he gently to his sister taking her by the hand and kissing her and then 
he left the room with rapid steps the little princess lay in the armchair mademoiselle 
bourienne chafing her temples princess mary supporting her sister in law still looked with her 
beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which prince andrew had gone and 
made the sign of the cross in his direction from the study like pistol shots 
came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose hardly had prince 
andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old 
man in the white dressing gown looked out all right said he and looking angrily 
at the unconscious little princess he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door book 
two 1805 chapter i in october 1805 a russian army was occupying the villages and 
towns of the archduchy of austria and yet other regiments freshly arriving from russia were 
settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered 
braunau was the headquarters of the commander in chief kutúzov on october 11 1805 one 
of the infantry regiments that had just reached braunau had halted half a mile from 
the town waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief despite the un russian 
appearance of the locality and gardens stone fences tiled roofs and hills in the despite 
the fact that the inhabitants who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not russians 
the regiment had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere 
in the heart of russia on the evening of the last march an order had 
been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march though 
the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander and the question 
arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not it was decided 
at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order on 
the principle that it is always better to too low than not bow low enough 
so the soldiers after a twenty mile march were kept mending and cleaning all night 
long without closing their eyes while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned and 
by morning the of the straggling disorderly crowd it had been on its last march 
the day a well ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his 
place and his duty had every button and every strap in place and shone with 
cleanliness and not only externally was all in order but had it pleased the commander 
in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a 
clean shirt and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles soap and all as 
the soldiers say there was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at 
ease it was the state of the boots more than half the boots were in 
holes but this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander for 
in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the austrian commissariat and 
the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles the commander of the regiment was an 
elderly choleric stout and thick set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider from 
chest to back than across the shoulders he had on a brand new uniform showing 
the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand 
rather than lie down on his massive shoulders he had the air of a man 
happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life he walked about in 
front of the line and at every step pulled himself up slightly arching his back 
it was plain that the commander admired his regiment rejoiced in it and that his 
whole mind was engrossed by it yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides military 
matters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts michael 
mítrich sir he said addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward it 
was plain that they both felt happy had our hands full last night however i 
think the regiment is not a bad one eh the battalion commander perceived the jovial 
irony and laughed would not be turned off the field even on the tsarítsin meadow 
asked the commander at that moment on the road from the town on which signalers 
had been posted two men appeared on horse back they were an aide de camp 
followed by a cossack the aide de camp was sent to confirm the order which 
had not been clearly worded the day before namely that the commander in chief wished 
to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the 
march in their greatcoats and packs and without any preparation whatever a member of the 
hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutúzov the day before with proposals and demands for 
him to join up with the army of the archduke ferdinand and mack and kutúzov 
not considering this junction advisable meant among other arguments in support of his view to 
show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from russia with 
this object he intended to meet the regiment so the worse the condition it was 
in the better pleased the commander in chief would be though the aide de camp 
did not know these circumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should 
be in their greatcoats and in marching order and that the commander in chief would 
otherwise be dissatisfied on hearing this the regimental commander hung his head silently shrugged his 
shoulders and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture fine mess made of it 
he remarked now i tell you michael mítrich that if it was said the it 
meant in greatcoats said he reproachfully to the battalion commander my god he added stepping 
resolutely forward commanders he shouted in a voice accustomed to command major how soon will 
he be here he asked the aide de camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating 
to the personage he was referring to an time i should say we have time 
to change clothes know general the regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered 
the soldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders ran off to their companies 
the sergeants major began bustling the greatcoats were not in very good condition and instantly 
the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to 
sway and stretch and hum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and 
fro throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps 
over their heads unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms in 
half an hour all was again in order only the squares had become gray instead 
of black the regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the 
regiment and examined it from a distance is this this he shouted and stood still 
of the third company of the third company wanted by the general commander to the 
general third company to the commander the words passed along the lines and an adjutant 
ran to look for the missing officer when the eager but misrepeated words had reached 
their destination in a cry of general to the third company the missing officer appeared 
from behind his company and though he was a middle aged man and not in 
the habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general the face 
showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has 
not learned spots appeared on his nose the redness of which was evidently due to 
intemperance and his mouth twitched nervously the general looked the captain up and down as 
he came up panting slackening his pace as he approached will soon be dressing your 
men in petticoats what is this shouted the regimental commander thrusting forward his jaw and 
pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of 
bluish cloth which contrasted with the others have you been after the commander in chief 
is expected and you leave your place eh teach you to dress the men in 
fancy coats for a parade eh the commander of the company with his eyes fixed 
on his superior pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap as if 
in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation why you speak whom have you 
got there dressed up as a hungarian said the commander with an austere gibe excellency 
your excellency what your excellency but what about your excellency nobody knows excellency the officer 
dólokhov who has been reduced to the ranks said the captain softly has he been 
degraded into a field marshal or into a soldier if a soldier he should be 
dressed in regulation uniform like the others excellency you gave him leave yourself on the 
march him leave leave just like you young men said the regimental commander cooling down 
a little indeed one says a word to you and you what he added with 
renewed irritation beg you to dress your men decently and the commander turning to look 
at the adjutant directed his jerky steps down the line he was evidently pleased at 
his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a 
further excuse for wrath having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge at another 
because his line was not straight he reached the third company o o w are 
you standing your leg your leg shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in 
his voice while there were still five men between him and dólokhov with his bluish 
gray uniform dólokhov slowly straightened his bent knee looking straight with his clear insolent eyes 
in the face a blue coat off with it sergeant major change his coat the 
ras he did not finish i must obey orders but i am not bound to 
endure dólokhov hurriedly interrupted talking in the ranks no talking no talking bound to endure 
insults dólokhov concluded in loud ringing tones the eyes of the general and the soldier 
met the general became silent angrily pulling down his tight scarf request you to have 
the goodness to change your coat he said as he turned away chapter ii coming 
shouted the signaler at that moment the regimental commander flushing ran to his horse seized 
the stirrup with trembling hands threw his body across the saddle righted himself drew his 
saber and with a happy and resolute countenance opening his mouth awry prepared to shout 
the regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless ention shouted the 
regimental commander in a soul shaking voice which expressed joy for himself severity for the 
regiment and welcome for the approaching chief along the broad country road edged on both 
sides by trees came a high light blue viennese calèche slightly creaking on its springs 
and drawn by six horses at a smart trot behind the calèche galloped the suite 
and a convoy of croats beside kutúzov sat an austrian general in a white uniform 
that looked strange among the russian black ones the calèche stopped in front of the 
regiment kutúzov and the austrian general were talking in low voices and kutúzov smiled slightly 
as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand 
men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist the word of 
command rang out and again the regiment quivered as with a jingling sound it presented 
arms then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was 
heard the regiment roared to your ex len len lency and again all became silent 
at first kutúzov stood still while the regiment moved then he and the general in 
white accompanied by the suite walked between the ranks from the way the regimental commander 
saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously 
and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forward and 
hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way he darted forward at 
every word or gesture of the commander in chief it was evident that he performed 
his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander 
thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others 
that had reached braunau at the same time was in splendid condition there were only 
217 sick and stragglers everything was in good order except the boots kutúzov walked through 
the ranks sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known 
in the turkish war sometimes also to the soldiers looking at their boots he several 
times shook his head sadly pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression 
which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not help noticing 
what a bad state of things it was the regimental commander ran forward on each 
such occasion fearing to miss a single word of the commander in regarding the regiment 
behind kutúzov at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard followed 
some twenty men of his suite these gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed nearest 
of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant this was prince bolkónski 
beside him was his comrade nesvítski a tall staff officer extremely stout with a kindly 
smiling handsome face and moist eyes nesvítski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a 
swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him this hussar with a grave face and without 
a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes watched the regimental 
back and mimicked his every movement each time the commander started and bent forward the 
hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner nesvítski laughed and nudged the 
others to make them look at the wag kutúzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands 
of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief on reaching the 
third company he suddenly stopped his suite not having expected this involuntarily came closer to 
him timókhin said he recognizing the red nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account 
of the blue greatcoat one would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch 
himself more than timókhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander but 
now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an 
extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief 
continued to look at him and so kutúzov who evidently understood his case and wished 
him nothing but good quickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred 
and puffy face ismail comrade said he brave officer are you satisfied with him he 
asked the regimental commander and the that he was being reflected in the hussar officer 
as in a looking moved forward and answered satisfied your excellency all have our weaknesses 
said kutúzov smiling and walking away from him used to have a predilection for bacchus 
the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer 
the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red nosed captain and his 
drawn in stomach and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that nesvítski could 
not help laughing kutúzov turned round the officer evidently had complete control of his face 
and while kutúzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most 
serious deferential and innocent expression the third company was the last and kutúzov pondered apparently 
trying to recollect something prince andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in 
french told me to remind you of the officer dólokhov reduced to the ranks in 
this regiment is dólokhov asked kutúzov dólokhov who had already changed into a gray greatcoat 
did not wait to be called the shapely figure of the fair haired soldier with 
his clear blue eyes stepped forward from the ranks went up to the commander in 
chief and presented arms you a complaint to make kutúzov asked with a slight frown 
is dólokhov said prince andrew said kutúzov hope this will be a lesson to you 
do your duty the emperor is gracious and i forget you if you deserve well 
the clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they 
had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expression to tear open the veil 
of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private thing i 
ask of your excellency dólokhov said in his firm ringing deliberate voice ask an opportunity 
to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and 
to russia kutúzov turned away the same smile of the eyes with which he had 
turned from captain timókhin again flitted over his face he turned away with a grimace 
as if to say that everything dólokhov had said to him and everything he could 
say had long been known to him that he was weary of it and it 
was not at all what he wanted he turned away and went to the carriage 
the regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointed quarters near braunau where 
they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches bear 
me a grudge prokhór ignátych said the regimental commander overtaking the third company on its 
way to its quarters and riding up to captain timókhin who was walking in front 
the regimental face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight in 
the service it be helped one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade i am 
the first to apologize you know me he was very pleased and he held out 
his hand to the captain mention it general as if be so bold replied the 
captain his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front 
teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun 
at ismail tell mr dólokhov that i forget may be quite easy and tell me 
been meaning to is he behaving himself and in general far as the service goes 
he is quite punctilious your excellency but his character said timókhin what about his character 
asked the regimental commander different on different days answered the captain day he is sensible 
well educated and good natured and the next a wild beast in poland if you 
please he nearly killed a jew well well remarked the regimental commander one must have 
pity on a young man in misfortune you know he has important connections well then 
you just will your excellency said timókhin showing by his smile that he understood his 
wish of course of course the regimental commander sought out dólokhov in the ranks and 
reining in his horse said to him the next affair epaulettes dólokhov looked round but 
did not say anything nor did the mocking smile on his lips change all right 
continued the regimental commander cup of vodka for the men from me he added so 
that the soldiers could hear thank you all god be praised and he rode past 
that company and overtook the next one really a good fellow one can serve under 
him said timókhin to the subaltern beside him a word a hearty one said the 
subaltern laughing the regimental commander was nicknamed king of hearts the cheerful mood of their 
officers after the inspection infected the soldiers the company marched on gaily the voices could 
be heard on every side they said kutúzov was blind of one eye so he 
is quite blind friend he is sharper eyed than you are boots and leg bands 
he noticed everything he looked at my feet friend well thinks i that other one 
with him the austrian looked as if he were smeared with white as flour i 
suppose they polish him up as they do the guns say fédeshon did he say 
when the battles are to begin you were near him everybody said that buonaparte himself 
was at braunau himself just listen to the fool what he know the prussians are 
up in arms now the austrians you see are putting them down when been put 
down the war with buonaparte will begin and he says buonaparte is in braunau shows 
a fool better listen more carefully devils these quartermasters are see the fifth company is 
turning into the village already they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our 
quarters me a biscuit you devil did you give me tobacco yesterday just it friend 
ah well never mind here you are might call a halt here or have to 
do another four miles without eating it fine when those germans gave us lifts you 
just sit still and are drawn along here friend the people are quite beggarly there 
they all seemed to be under the russian here all regular germans to the came 
the order and from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front a 
drummer their leader turned round facing the singers and flourishing his arm began a long 
drawn out song commencing with the words dawned the sun was rising and concluding then 
brothers on to glory led by father kámenski this song had been composed in the 
turkish campaign and now being sung in austria the only change being that the words 
were replaced by kutúzov having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved 
his arms as if flinging something to the ground the lean handsome soldier of sternly 
at the singers and screwed up his eyes then having satisfied himself that all eyes 
were fixed on him he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but 
precious object above his head and holding it there for some seconds suddenly flung it 
down and began my bower oh my bower my bower new chimed in twenty voices 
and the castanet player in spite of the burden of his equipment rushed out to 
the front and walking backwards before the company jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets 
as if threatening someone the soldiers swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously marched with 
long steps behind the company the sound of wheels the creaking of springs and the 
tramp of hoofs were heard kutúzov and his suite were returning to the town the 
commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease 
and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and 
the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men in the 
second file from the right flank beside which the carriage passed the company a blue 
eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice it was dólokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in 
time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all 
who were not at that moment marching with the company the hussar cornet of suite 
who had mimicked the regimental commander fell back from the carriage and rode up to 
dólokhov hussar cornet zherkóv had at one time in petersburg belonged to the wild set 
led by dólokhov zherkóv had met dólokhov abroad as a private and had not seen 
fit to recognize him but now that kutúzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker he 
addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend dear fellow how are you said 
he through the singing making his horse keep pace with the company am i dólokhov 
answered coldly am as you see the lively song gave a special flavor to the 
tone of free and easy gaiety with which zherkóv spoke and to the intentional coldness 
of reply how do you get on with the officers inquired zherkóv right they are 
good fellows and how have you wriggled onto the staff was attached on duty both 
were silent let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the song 
arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness their conversation would probably have been different 
but for the effect of that song it true that austrians have been beaten asked 
dólokhov devil only knows they say so glad answered dólokhov briefly and clearly as the 
song demanded say come round some evening and have a game of faro said zherkóv 
have you too much money come sworn not to i drink and play till i 
get reinstated only till the first engagement shall see they were again silent if you 
need anything one can at least be of use on the staff dólokhov smiled trouble 
if i want anything i take it never mind i only i only by health 
a long long way to my native land zherkóv touched his horse with the spurs 
it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down 
galloped past the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the song chapter 
iii on returning from the review kutúzov took the austrian general into his private room 
and calling his adjutant asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops 
on their arrival and the letters that had come from the archduke ferdinand who was 
in command of the advanced army prince andrew bolkónski came into the room with the 
required papers kutúzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table 
on which a plan was spread out said kutúzov glancing at bolkónski as if by 
this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with the 
conversation in french i can say general said he with a pleasant elegance of expression 
and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word it was evident 
that kutúzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice i can say general is 
that if the matter depended on my personal wishes the will of his majesty the 
emperor francis would have been fulfilled long ago i should long ago have joined the 
archduke and believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a 
pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a 
better informed and more skillful whom austria has so to lay down all this heavy 
responsibility but circumstances are sometimes too strong for us general and kutúzov smiled in a 
way that seemed to say are quite at liberty not to believe me and i 
even care whether you do or not but you have no grounds for telling me 
so and that is the whole point the austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no 
option but to reply in the same tone the contrary he said in a querulous 
and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words the contrary your participation in the 
common action is highly valued by his majesty but we think the present delay is 
depriving the splendid russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed 
to win in their battles he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence kutúzov bowed with the 
same smile that is my conviction and judging by the last letter with which his 
highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me i imagine that the austrian troops under the 
direction of so skillful a leader as general mack have by now already gained a 
decisive victory and no longer need our aid said kutúzov the general frowned though there 
was no definite news of an austrian defeat there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable 
rumors that were afloat and so suggestion of an austrian victory sounded much like irony 
but kutúzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression which seemed to say that 
he had a right to suppose so and in fact the last letter he had 
received from army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the 
army was very favorable me that letter said kutúzov turning to prince andrew have a 
look at kutúzov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to 
the austrian general the following passage in german from the archduke letter we have fully 
concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy 
should he cross the lech also as we are masters of ulm we cannot be 
deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the danube so that should the 
enemy not cross the lech we can cross the danube throw ourselves on his line 
of communications recross the river lower down and frustrate his intention should he try to 
direct his whole force against our faithful ally we shall therefore confidently await the moment 
when the imperial russian army will be fully equipped and shall then in conjunction with 
it easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves kutúzov 
sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the hofkriegsrath mildly 
and attentively you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expect the worst 
said the austrian general evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to 
business he involuntarily looked round at the aide de camp me general interrupted kutúzov also 
turning to prince andrew here my dear fellow get from kozlóvski all the reports from 
our scouts here are two letters from count nostitz and here is one from his 
highness the archduke ferdinand and here are these he said handing him several papers a 
neat memorandum in french out of all this showing all the news we have had 
of the movements of the austrian army and then give it to his excellency prince 
andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what 
had been said but also what kutúzov would have liked to tell him he gathered 
up the papers and with a bow to both stepped softly over the carpet and 
went out into the waiting room though not much time had passed since prince andrew 
had left russia he had changed greatly during that period in the expression of his 
face in his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of his former 
affected languor and indolence he now looked like a man who has time to think 
of the impression he makes on others but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work 
his face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him his smile and glance 
were brighter and more attractive kutúzov whom he had overtaken in poland had received him 
very kindly promised not to forget him distinguished him above the other adjutants and had 
taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissions from vienna kutúzov wrote 
to his old comrade prince father your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished 
by his industry firmness and expedition i consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate 
by me on staff among his fellow officers and in the army generally prince andrew 
had as he had had in petersburg society two quite opposite reputations some a minority 
acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else expected great things of 
him listened to him admired and imitated him and with them prince andrew was natural 
and pleasant others the majority disliked him and considered him conceited cold and disagreeable but 
among these people prince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected 
and even feared him coming out of room into the waiting room with the papers 
in his hand prince andrew came up to his comrade the aide de camp on 
duty kozlóvski who was sitting at the window with a book prince asked kozlóvski am 
ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not advancing why is it prince 
andrew shrugged his shoulders news from mack it were true that he has been beaten 
news would have come said prince andrew moving toward the outer door but at that 
instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat with the order of maria theresa on 
his neck and a black bandage round his head who had evidently just arrived entered 
quickly slamming the door prince andrew stopped short in chief kutúzov said the newly arrived 
general speaking quickly with a harsh german accent looking to both sides and advancing straight 
toward the inner door commander in chief is engaged said kozlóvski going hurriedly up to 
the unknown general and blocking his way to the door shall i announce the unknown 
general looked disdainfully down at kozlóvski who was rather short as if surprised that anyone 
should not know him commander in chief is engaged repeated kozlóvski calmly the face clouded 
his lips quivered and trembled he took out a notebook hurriedly scribbled something in pencil 
tore out the leaf gave it to kozlóvski stepped quickly to the window and threw 
himself into a chair gazing at those in the room as if asking do they 
look at me then he lifted his head stretched his neck as if he intended 
to say something but immediately with affected indifference began to hum to himself producing a 
queer sound which immediately broke off the door of the private room opened and kutúzov 
appeared in the doorway the general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running 
away from some danger and making long quick strides with his thin legs went up 
to kutúzov voyez le malheureux mack he uttered in a broken voice face as he 
stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments then wrinkles ran 
over his face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again he bowed his 
head respectfully closed his eyes silently let mack enter his room before him and closed 
the door himself behind him the report which had been circulated that the austrians had 
been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correct 
within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with orders which showed 
that the russian troops who had hitherto been inactive would also soon have to meet 
the enemy prince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay 
in the general progress of the war when he saw mack and heard the details 
of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost understood all the difficulties 
of the russian position and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would 
have to play involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation 
of arrogant austria and that in a time he might perhaps see and take part 
in the first russian encounter with the french since suvórov met them he feared that 
genius might outweigh all the courage of the russian troops and at the same time 
could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced excited and irritated by these 
thoughts prince andrew went toward his room to write to his father to whom he 
wrote every day in the corridor he met nesvítski with whom he shared a room 
and the wag zherkóv they were as usual laughing are you so glum asked nesvítski 
noticing prince pale face and glittering eyes nothing to be gay about answered bolkónski just 
as prince andrew met nesvítski and zherkóv there came toward them from the other end 
of the corridor strauch an austrian general who was on staff in charge of the 
provisioning of the russian army and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the 
previous evening there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass 
the three officers quite easily but zherkóv pushing nesvítski aside with his arm said in 
a breathless voice coming coming stand aside make way please make way the generals were 
passing by looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions on the face of 
the wag zherkóv there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable 
to suppress excellency said he in german stepping forward and addressing the austrian general have 
the honor to congratulate you he bowed his head and scraped first with one foot 
and then with the other awkwardly like a child at a dancing lesson the member 
of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile 
could not but give him a attention he screwed up his eyes showing that he 
was listening have the honor to congratulate you general mack has arrived quite well only 
a little bruised just here he added pointing with a beaming smile to his head 
the general frowned turned away and went on wie naiv said he angrily after he 
had gone a few steps god what simplicity nesvítski with a laugh threw his arms 
round prince andrew but bolkónski turning still paler pushed him away with an angry look 
and turned to zherkóv the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of mack the news 
of his defeat and the thought of what lay before the russian army found vent 
in anger at untimely jest you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he 
said sharply with a slight trembling of the lower jaw prevent your doing so but 
i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence i 
will teach you to behave yourself nesvítski and zherkóv were so surprised by this outburst 
that they gazed at bolkónski silently with wide open eyes the matter i only congratulated 
them said zherkóv am not jesting with you please be silent cried bolkónski and taking 
arm he left zherkóv who did not know what to say the matter old fellow 
said nesvítski trying to soothe him the matter exclaimed prince andrew standing still in his 
excitement you understand that either we are officers serving our tsar and our country rejoicing 
in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause or we are 
merely lackeys who care nothing for their business quarante mille hommes massacrés et de nos 
alliés détruite et vous trouvez là le mot pour rire he said as if strengthening 
his views by this french sentence bien pour un garçon de rien comme cet individu 
dont vous avez fait un ami mais pas pour vous pas pour vous 2 only 
a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way he added in pronouncing the word with 
a french noticed that zherkóv could still hear him thousand men massacred and the army 
of our allies destroyed and you find that a cause for jesting 2 is all 
very well for that good for nothing fellow of whom you have made a friend 
but not for you not for you he waited a moment to see whether the 
cornet would answer but he turned and went out of the corridor chapter iv the 
pávlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau the squadron in which nicholas rostóv served 
as a cadet was quartered in the german village of salzeneck the best quarters in 
the village were assigned to cavalry captain denísov the squadron commander known throughout the whole 
cavalry division as váska denísov cadet rostóv ever since he had overtaken the regiment in 
poland had lived with the squadron commander on october 11 the day when all was 
astir at headquarters over the news of defeat the camp life of the officers of 
this squadron was proceeding as usual denísov who had been losing at cards all night 
had not yet come home when rostóv rode back early in the morning from a 
foraging expedition rostóv in his cadet uniform with a jerk to his horse rode up 
to the porch swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement stood 
for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse and 
at last sprang down and called to his orderly bondarénko dear friend said he to 
the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse him up and down my dear 
fellow he continued with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to everyone 
when they are happy your excellency answered the ukrainian gaily tossing his head walk him 
up and down well another hussar also rushed toward the horse but bondarénko had already 
thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the head it was evident that the 
cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him rostóv patted 
the neck and then his flank and lingered for a moment what a horse he 
will be he thought with a smile and holding up his saber his spurs jingling 
he ran up the steps of the porch his landlord who in a waistcoat and 
a pointed cap pitchfork in hand was clearing manure from the cowhouse looked out and 
his face immediately brightened on seeing rostóv gut morgen schön gut morgen he said winking 
with a merry smile evidently pleased to greet the young man very good morning a 
very good morning fleissig said rostóv with the same gay brotherly smile which did not 
leave his eager face oestreicher hoch russen kaiser alexander hoch 2 said he quoting words 
often repeated by the german landlord already 2 for the austrians hurrah for the russians 
hurrah for emperor alexander the german laughed came out of the cowshed pulled off his 
cap and waving it above his head cried die ganze welt hoch hurrah for the 
whole world rostóv waved his cap above his head like the german and cried laughing 
vivat die ganze welt though neither the german cleaning his cowshed nor rostóv back with 
his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing they looked at each 
other with joyful delight and brotherly love wagged their heads in token of their mutual 
affection and parted smiling the german returning to his cowshed and rostóv going to the 
cottage he occupied with denísov about your master he asked lavrúshka orderly whom all the 
regiment knew for a rogue been in since the evening must have been losing answered 
lavrúshka know by now if he wins he comes back early to brag about it 
but if he stays out till morning it means lost and will come back in 
a rage will you have coffee bring some ten minutes later lavrúshka brought the coffee 
coming said he for trouble rostóv looked out of the window and saw denísov coming 
home denísov was a small man with a red face sparkling black eyes and black 
tousled mustache and hair he wore an unfastened cloak wide breeches hanging down in creases 
and a crumpled shako on the back of his head he came up to the 
porch gloomily hanging his head he shouted loudly and angrily it off blockhead i am 
taking it off replied voice up already said denísov entering the room ago answered rostóv 
have already been for the hay and have seen fräulein mathilde and been losing bwother 
i lost yesterday like a damned fool cried denísov not pronouncing his ill luck such 
ill luck as soon as you left it began and went on hullo there tea 
puckering up his face though smiling and showing his short strong teeth he began with 
stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair what devil 
made me go to that wat an officer nicknamed he said rubbing his forehead and 
whole face with both hands fancy he let me win a single cahd not one 
cahd he took the lighted pipe that was offered to him gripped it in his 
fist and tapped it on the floor making the sparks fly while he continued to 
shout lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it 
gives the singles and snatches the doubles he scattered the burning tobacco smashed the pipe 
and threw it away then he remained silent for a while and all at once 
looked cheerfully with his glittering black eyes at rostóv at least we had some women 
here but nothing foh one to do but dwink if we could only get to 
fighting soon hullo there he said turning to the door as he heard a tread 
of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop and a 
respectful cough squadron quartermaster said lavrúshka face puckered still more he muttered throwing down a 
purse with some gold in it deah fellow just see how much there is left 
and shove the purse undah the pillow he said and went out to the quartermaster 
rostóv took the money and mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles 
began counting them telyánin how do they plucked me last night came voice from the 
next room at at the i knew it replied a piping voice and lieutenant telyánin 
a small officer of the same squadron entered the room rostóv thrust the purse under 
the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him telyánin for some 
reason had been transferred from the guards just before this campaign he behaved very well 
in the regiment but was not liked rostóv especially detested him and was unable to 
overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man young cavalryman how is my rook 
behaving he asked rook was a young horse telyánin had sold to rostóv the lieutenant 
never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face his eyes continually 
wandered from one object to another saw you riding this morning he added all right 
a good horse answered rostóv though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred 
rubbles was not worth half that sum begun to go a little lame on the 
left foreleg he added cracked nothing teach you what to do and show you what 
kind of rivet to use please do said rostóv show you show you not a 
secret and a horse thank me for have it brought round said rostóv wishing to 
avoid telyánin and he went out to give the order in the passage denísov with 
a pipe was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him 
on seeing rostóv denísov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his 
thumb to the room where telyánin was sitting he frowned and gave a shudder of 
disgust i like that fellow he said regardless of the presence rostóv shrugged his shoulders 
as much as to say do i but one to do and having given his 
order he returned to telyánin telyánin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which 
rostóv had left him rubbing his small white hands there certainly are disgusting people thought 
rostóv as he entered you told them to bring the horse asked telyánin getting up 
and looking carelessly about him have us go ourselves i only came round to ask 
denísov about order have you got it denísov yet but where are you off to 
want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse said telyánin they went 
through the porch and into the stable the lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof 
and went away to his own quarters when rostóv went back there was a bottle 
of vodka and a sausage on the table denísov was sitting there scratching with his 
pen on a sheet of paper he looked gloomily in face and said am witing 
to her he leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand 
and evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to 
write told rostóv the contents of his letter see my fwiend he said sleep when 
we love we are childwen of the dust but one falls in love and one 
is a god one is as on the fihst day of cweation that now send 
him to the devil busy he shouted to lavrúshka who went up to him not 
in the least abashed should it be you yourself told him to come the quartermaster 
for the money denísov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped business 
he muttered to himself much is left in the puhse he asked turning to rostóv 
new and three old imperials wetched well what are you standing there for you call 
the quahtehmasteh he shouted to lavrúshka denísov let me lend you some i have some 
you know said rostóv blushing like bowwowing from my own fellows i growled denísov if 
you accept money from me like a comrade you will offend me really i have 
some rostóv repeated i tell you and denísov went to the bed to get the 
purse from under the pillow have you put it wostóv the lower pillow not there 
denísov threw both pillows on the floor the purse was not there a miwacle you 
dropped it said rostóv picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them 
he pulled off the quilt and shook it the purse was not there me can 
i have forgotten no i remember thinking that you kept it under your head like 
a treasure said rostóv put it just here where is it he asked turning to 
lavrúshka been in the room it must be where you put it it always like 
that you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it feel in your pockets if 
i thought of it being a treasure said rostóv i remember putting it there lavrúshka 
turned all the bedding over looked under the bed and under the table searched everywhere 
and stood still in the middle of the room denísov silently watched movements and when 
the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found 
denísov glanced at rostóv not been playing schoolboy twicks rostóv felt gaze fixed on him 
raised his eyes and instantly dropped them again all the blood which had seemed congested 
somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes he could not draw breath 
there been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves it must be here 
somewhere said lavrúshka then you puppet look alive and hunt for it shouted denísov suddenly 
turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture the purse found flog 
you flog you all rostóv his eyes avoiding denísov began buttoning his coat buckled on 
his saber and put on his cap must have that purse i tell you shouted 
denísov shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall let him 
alone i know who has taken it said rostóv going toward the door without raising 
his eyes denísov paused thought a moment and evidently understanding what rostóv hinted at seized 
his arm he cried and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like 
cords are mad i tell you i allow it the purse is here flay this 
scoundwel alive and it will be found know who has taken it repeated rostóv in 
an unsteady voice and went to the door i tell you you dahe to do 
it shouted denísov rushing at the cadet to restrain him but rostóv pulled away his 
arm and with as much anger as though denísov were his worst enemy firmly fixed 
his eyes directly on his face you understand what saying he said in a trembling 
voice was no one else in the room except myself so that if it is 
not so then he could not finish and ran out of the room may the 
devil take you and evewybody were the last words rostóv heard rostóv went to quarters 
master is not in gone to headquarters said orderly something happened he added surprised at 
the troubled face nothing only just missed him said the orderly the headquarters were situated 
two miles away from salzeneck and rostóv without returning home took a horse and rode 
there there was an inn in the village which the officers frequented rostóv rode up 
to it and saw horse at the porch in the second room of the inn 
the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine come 
here too young man he said smiling and raising his eyebrows said rostóv as if 
it cost him a great deal to utter the word and he sat down at 
the nearest table both were silent there were two germans and a russian officer in 
the room no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives 
and the munching of the lieutenant when telyánin had finished his lunch he took out 
of his pocket a double purse and drawing its rings aside with his small white 
turned up fingers drew out a gold imperial and lifting his eyebrows gave it to 
the waiter be quick he said the coin was a new one rostóv rose and 
went up to telyánin me to look at your purse he said in a low 
almost inaudible voice with shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised telyánin handed him the purse 
a nice purse yes yes he said growing suddenly pale and added at it young 
man rostóv took the purse in his hand examined it and the money in it 
and looked at telyánin the lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly 
seemed to grow very merry we get to vienna get rid of it there but 
in these wretched little towns nowhere to spend it said he let me have it 
young man going rostóv did not speak you are you going to have lunch too 
they feed you quite decently here continued telyánin then let me have it he stretched 
out his hand to take hold of the purse rostóv let go of it telyánin 
took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches 
with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open as if to say yes i 
am putting my purse in my pocket and quite simple and is no one business 
young man he said with a sigh and from under his lifted brows he glanced 
into eyes some flash as of an electric spark shot from eyes to and back 
and back again and again in an instant here said rostóv catching hold of arm 
and almost dragging him to the window money is you took it he whispered just 
above ear what how dare you what said telyánin but these words came like a 
piteous despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon as soon as rostóv heard them an 
enormous load of doubt fell from him he was glad and at the same instant 
began to pity the miserable man who stood before him but the task he had 
begun had to be completed only knows what the people here may imagine muttered telyánin 
taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room must have an explanation 
know it and shall prove it said rostóv every muscle of pale terrified face began 
to quiver his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look 
not rising to face and his sobs were audible ruin a young fellow here is 
this wretched money take it he threw it on the table have an old father 
and mother rostóv took the money avoiding eyes and went out of the room without 
a word but at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps god he 
said with tears in his eyes could you do it said telyánin drawing nearer to 
him touch me said rostóv drawing back you need it take the money and he 
threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn chapter v that same 
evening there was an animated discussion among the officers in quarters i tell you rostóv 
that you must apologize to the colonel said a tall grizzly haired staff captain with 
enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features to rostóv who was crimson with 
excitement the staff captain kírsten had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of 
honor and had twice regained his commission will allow no one to call me a 
liar cried rostóv told me i lied and i told him he lied and there 
it rests he may keep me on duty every day or may place me under 
arrest but no one can make me apologize because if he as commander of this 
regiment thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction then just wait a moment 
my dear fellow and listen interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass calmly stroking 
his long mustache tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer 
has stolen not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers 
perhaps i ought not to have spoken before them but i am not a diplomatist 
why i joined the hussars thinking that here one would not need finesse and he 
tells me that i am let him give me satisfaction all right no one thinks 
you a coward but not the point ask denísov whether it is not out of 
the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander denísov sat gloomily 
biting his mustache and listening to the conversation evidently with no wish to take part 
in it he answered the staff question by a disapproving shake of his head speak 
to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers continued the staff captain the 
colonel was called bogdánich you up did not shut me up he said i was 
telling an untruth have it so and you talked a lot of nonsense to him 
and must apologize on any account exclaimed rostóv did not expect this of you said 
the staff captain seriously and severely wish to apologize but man not only to him 
but to the whole of to blame all round the case is this you ought 
to have thought the matter over and taken advice but no you go and blurt 
it all straight out before the officers now what was the colonel to do have 
the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment disgrace the whole regiment because of one 
scoundrel is that how you look at it we see it like that and bogdánich 
was a brick he told you you were saying what was not true not pleasant 
but to be done my dear fellow you landed yourself in it and now when 
one wants to smooth the thing over some conceit prevents your apologizing and you wish 
to make the whole affair public you are offended at being put on duty a 
bit but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer whatever bogdánich may be 
anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel quick at taking offense but you 
mind disgracing the whole regiment the staff voice began to tremble have been in the 
regiment next to no time my lad here today and tomorrow be appointed adjutant somewhere 
and can snap your fingers when it is said are thieves among the pávlograd officers 
but not all the same to us am i not right denísov not the same 
denísov remained silent and did not move but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes 
at rostóv value your own pride and wish to apologize continued the staff captain we 
old fellows who have grown up in and god willing are going to die in 
the regiment we prize the honor of the regiment and bogdánich knows it oh we 
do prize it old fellow and all this is not right not right you may 
take offense or not but i always stick to mother truth not right and the 
staff captain rose and turned away from rostóv twue devil take it shouted denísov jumping 
up then wostóv now then rostóv growing red and pale alternately looked first at one 
officer and then at the other gentlemen no you think i quite understand wrong to 
think that of me i for me for the honor of the regiment ah well 
show that in action and for me the honor of the flag well never mind 
true to blame to blame all round well what else do you want right count 
cried the staff captain turning round and clapping rostóv on the shoulder with his big 
hand tell you shouted denísov a fine fellow better count said the staff captain beginning 
to address rostóv by his title as if in recognition of his confession and apologize 
your excellency yes go do anything no one shall hear a word from me said 
rostóv in an imploring voice i apologize by god i do what you will how 
can i go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness denísov began to laugh 
be worse for you bogdánich is vindictive and pay for your obstinacy said kírsten on 
my word not obstinacy i describe the feeling i as you like said the staff 
captain what has become of that scoundrel he asked denísov has weported himself sick to 
be stwuck off the list tomowwow muttered denísov is an illness no other way of 
explaining it said the staff captain or not better not cwoss my path kill him 
shouted denísov in a bloodthirsty tone just then zherkóv entered the room brings you here 
cried the officers turning to the newcomer to go into action gentlemen mack has surrendered 
with his whole army not true seen him myself saw the real mack with hands 
and feet action into action bring him a bottle for such news but how did 
you come here been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil 
mack an austrian general complained of me i congratulated him on arrival the matter rostóv 
you look as if just come out of a hot bath my dear fellow in 
such a stew here these last two days the regimental adjutant came in and confirmed 
the news brought by zherkóv they were under orders to advance next day going into 
action gentlemen thank god been sitting here too long chapter vi kutúzov fell back toward 
vienna destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers inn at braunau and traun near 
linz on october 23 the russian troops were crossing the river enns at midday the 
russian baggage train the artillery and columns of troops were defiling through the town of 
enns on both sides of the bridge it was a warm rainy autumnal day the 
wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding 
the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain and then 
suddenly spread out in the sunlight far distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as 
though freshly varnished down below the little town could be seen with its white red 
roofed houses its cathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed jostling masses 
of russian troops at the bend of the danube vessels an island and a castle 
with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the enns and the 
danube became visible and the rocky left bank of the danube covered with pine forests 
with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges the turrets of a convent 
stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest and far away on the other side 
of the enns the horse patrols could be discerned among the field guns on the 
brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff 
officer scanning the country through his fieldglass a little behind them nesvítski who had been 
sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief was sitting on the trail of 
a gun carriage a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a 
flask and nesvítski was treating some officers to pies and real doppelkümmel the officers gladly 
gathered round him some on their knees some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grass 
the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool a fine place why are 
you not eating anything gentlemen nesvítski was saying you very much prince answered one of 
the officers pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance a lovely 
place we passed close to the park and saw two deer and what a splendid 
house prince said another who would have dearly liked to take another pie but felt 
shy and therefore pretended to be examining the our infantrymen have already got there look 
there in the meadow behind the village three of them are dragging something ransack that 
castle he remarked with evident approval they will said nesvítski but what i should like 
added he munching a pie in his moist lipped handsome mouth be to slip in 
over there he pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery and his eyes narrowed 
and gleamed would be fine gentlemen the officers laughed to flutter the nuns a bit 
they say there are italian girls among them on my word give five years of 
my life for it must be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officers 
laughing meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general who 
looked through his field glass so it is so it is said the general angrily 
lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders it is be fired on at the 
crossing and why are they dawdling there on the opposite side the enemy could be 
seen by the naked eye and from their battery a milk white cloud arose then 
came the distant report of a shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to 
the crossing nesvítski rose puffing and went up to the general smiling not your excellency 
like a little refreshment he said a bad business said the general without answering him 
men have been wasting time i better ride over your excellency asked nesvítski please do 
answered the general and he repeated the order that had already once been given in 
detail tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge 
as i ordered and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected good answered 
nesvítski he called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsack 
and flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle really call in on 
the nuns he said to the officers who watched him smilingly and he rode off 
by the winding path down the hill then see how far it will carry captain 
just try said the general turning to an artillery officer a little fun to pass 
the time to your guns commanded the officer in a moment the men came running 
gaily from their campfires and began loading came the command number one jumped briskly aside 
the gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above 
the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy 
a little smoke showing the spot where it burst the faces of officers and men 
brightened up at the sound everyone got up and began watching the movements of our 
troops below as plainly visible as if but a throw away and the movements of 
the approaching enemy farther off at the same instant the sun came fully out from 
behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of 
the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression chapter vii two of 
the shots had already flown across the bridge where there was a crush halfway across 
stood prince nesvítski who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed 
against the railings he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps 
behind him holding two horses by their bridles each time prince nesvítski tried to move 
on soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings and 
all he could do was to smile a fine fellow you are friend said the 
cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who 
were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses a fellow you wait a 
moment you see the general wants to pass but the convoyman took no notice of 
the word and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way there boys keep 
to the left wait a bit but the soldiers crowded together shoulder to shoulder their 
bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a dense mass looking down over the rails 
prince nesvítski saw the rapid noisy little waves of the enns which rippling and eddying 
round the piles of the bridge chased each other along looking on the bridge he 
saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers shoulder straps covered shakos knapsacks bayonets long muskets 
and under the shakos faces with broad cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tired expressions and 
feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge sometimes 
through the monotonous waves of men like a fleck of white foam on the waves 
of the enns an officer in a cloak and with a type of face different 
from that of the men squeezed his way along sometimes like a chip of wood 
whirling in the river an hussar on foot an orderly or a townsman was carried 
through the waves of infantry and sometimes like a log floating down the river an 
or baggage wagon piled high leather covered and hemmed in on all sides moved across 
the bridge as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly there many more 
of you to come million all but one replied a waggish soldier in a torn 
coat with a wink and passed on followed by another an old man he meant 
the enemy popping at the bridge now said the old soldier dismally to a comrade 
forget to scratch yourself that soldier passed on and after him came another sitting on 
a cart the devil have the leg bands been shoved to said an orderly running 
behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it and he also passed on 
with the wagon then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking then old 
fellow he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun 
a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily with a wide swing of 
his arm the ham was just delicious answered another with a loud laugh and they 
too passed on so that nesvítski did not learn who had been struck on the 
teeth or what the ham had to do with it how they scurry he just 
sends a ball and they think all be killed a sergeant was saying angrily and 
reproachfully it flies past me daddy the ball i mean said a young soldier with 
an enormous mouth hardly refraining from laughing felt like dying of fright i did my 
word i got that frightened said he as if bragging of having been frightened that 
one also passed then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before it was 
a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german and seemed loaded 
with a whole houseful of effects a fine brindled cow with a large udder was 
attached to the cart behind a woman with an unweaned baby an old woman and 
a healthy german girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds evidently 
these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission the eyes of all the soldiers 
turned toward the women and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the 
remarks related to the two young ones every face bore almost the same smile expressing 
unseemly thoughts about the women see the german sausage is making tracks too me the 
missis said another soldier addressing the german who angry and frightened strode energetically along with 
downcast eyes how smart made herself oh the devils fedótov you should be quartered on 
them have seen as much before now mate are you going asked an infantry officer 
who was eating an apple also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl 
the german closed his eyes signifying that he did not understand it if you like 
said the officer giving the girl an apple the girl smiled and took it nesvítski 
like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off 
the women till they had passed when they had gone by the same stream of 
soldiers followed with the same kind of talk and at last all stopped as often 
happens the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge 
and the whole crowd had to wait why are they stopping no proper order said 
the soldiers are you shoving to devil take you you wait be worse if he 
fires the bridge see an officer jammed in voices were saying in the crowd as 
the men looked at one another and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge 
looking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge nesvítski suddenly heard a 
sound new to him of something swiftly approaching something big that splashed into the water 
see where it carries to a soldier near by said sternly looking round at the 
sound us to get along quicker said another uneasily the crowd moved on again nesvítski 
realized that it was a cannon ball cossack my horse he said then you there 
get out of the way make way with great difficulty he managed to get to 
his horse and shouting continually he moved on the soldiers squeezed themselves to make way 
for him but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg and those 
nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder from behind 
nesvítski you numskull came a hoarse voice from behind him nesvítski looked round and saw 
some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry váska denísov 
red and shaggy with his cap on the back of his black head and a 
cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder these devils these fiends to let me pass shouted 
denísov evidently in a fit of rage his coal black eyes with their bloodshot whites 
glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as 
red as his face váska joyfully replied nesvítski up with you squadwon pass shouted váska 
denísov showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab which twitched its 
ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted spurting white foam from his bit tramping 
the planks of the bridge with his hoofs and apparently ready to jump over the 
railings had his rider let him is this like sheep just like sheep out of 
the way let us pass stop there you devil with the cart hack you with 
my saber he shouted actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it the 
soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces and denísov joined nesvítski it not drunk 
today said nesvítski when the other had ridden up to him even give one time 
to dwink answered váska denísov keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day if 
they mean to fight fight but the devil knows what this is a dandy you 
are today said nesvítski looking at new cloak and saddlecloth denísov smiled took out of 
his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume and put it to nose 
course going into action shaved bwushed my teeth and scented myself the imposing figure of 
nesvítski followed by his cossack and the determination of denísov who flourished his sword and 
shouted frantically had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther 
side of the bridge and stopped the infantry beside the bridge nesvítski found the colonel 
to whom he had to deliver the order and having done this he rode back 
having cleared the way denísov stopped at the end of the bridge carelessly holding in 
his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground eager to rejoin its fellows he 
watched his squadron draw nearer then the clang of hoofs as of several horses galloping 
resounded on the planks of the bridge and the squadron officers in front and men 
four abreast spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it 
the infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and 
gazed with that particular feeling of ill will estrangement and ridicule with which troops of 
different arms usually encounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them 
in regular order lads only fit for a fair said one good are they led 
about just for show remarked another kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar 
whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers like to put you on 
a two march with a knapsack your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed 
said an infantryman wiping the mud off his face with his sleeve up there more 
like a bird than a man now zíkin they ought to put you on a 
horse look fine said a corporal chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the 
weight of his knapsack a stick between your legs suit you for a horse the 
hussar shouted back chapter viii the last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge squeezing 
together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel at last the baggage 
wagons had all crossed the crush was less and the last battalion came onto the 
bridge only squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the 
enemy who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not 
yet visible from the bridge for the horizon as seen from the valley through which 
the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away at 
the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our cossack 
scouts were moving suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground artillery 
and troops in blue uniform were seen these were the french a group of cossack 
scouts retired down the hill at a trot all the officers and men of squadron 
though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions thought 
only of what was there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patches 
appearing on the skyline which they knew to be the troops the weather had cleared 
again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the danube and the dark 
hills around it it was calm and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts 
of the enemy could be heard from the hill there was no one now between 
the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers an empty space of some 
seven hundred yards was all that separated them the enemy ceased firing and that stern 
threatening inaccessible and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly 
felt step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the living from the 
dead lies uncertainty suffering and death and what is there who is there beyond that 
field that tree that roof lit up by the sun no one knows but one 
wants to know you fear and yet long to cross that line and know that 
sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what 
is there just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side 
of death but you are strong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other 
such excitedly animated and healthy men so thinks or at any rate feels anyone who 
comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad 
keenness of impression to everything that takes place at such moments on the high ground 
where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon rose and a ball flew whistling 
over the heads of the hussar squadron the officers who had been standing together rode 
off to their places the hussars began carefully aligning their horses silence fell on the 
whole squadron all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander 
awaiting the word of command a second and a third cannon ball flew past evidently 
they were firing at the hussars but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over 
the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them the hussars did not look 
round but at the sound of each shot as at the word of command the 
whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different holding its breath 
while the ball flew past rose in the stirrups and sank back again the soldiers 
without turning their heads glanced at one another curious to see their impression every face 
from to that of the bugler showed one common expression of conflict irritation and excitement 
around chin and mouth the quartermaster frowned looking at the soldiers as if threatening to 
punish them cadet mirónov ducked every time a ball flew past rostóv on the left 
flank mounted on his handsome horse despite its game the happy air of a schoolboy 
called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he 
will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyone with a clear bright expression as if 
asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire but despite himself on his 
face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth that 
curtseying there cadet miwónov not wight look at me cried denísov who unable to keep 
still on one spot kept turning his horse in front of the squadron the black 
hairy snub nosed face of váska denísov and his whole short sturdy figure with the 
sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked 
saber looked just as it usually did especially toward evening when he had emptied his 
second bottle he was only redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown back like 
birds when they drink pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse 
bedouin and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle he galloped to the other 
flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look 
to their pistols he rode up to kírsten the staff captain on his broad backed 
steady mare came at a walk to meet him his face with its long mustache 
was serious as always only his eyes were brighter than usual what about it said 
he to denísov come to a fight shall retire devil only knows what about muttered 
denísov wostóv he cried noticing the bright face got it at last and he smiled 
approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rostóv felt perfectly happy just then the commander appeared 
on the bridge denísov galloped up to him excellency let us attack them dwive them 
off indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up his face as if 
driving off a troublesome fly why are you stopping here you see the skirmishers are 
retreating lead the squadron back the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range 
of fire without having lost a single man the second squadron that had been in 
the front line followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther side of 
the river the two pávlograd squadrons having crossed the bridge retired up the hill one 
after the other their colonel karl bogdánich schubert came up to squadron and rode at 
a footpace not far from rostóv without taking any notice of him although they were 
now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning telyánin rostóv feeling that he 
was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now 
admitted that he had been to blame did not lift his eyes from the athletic 
back his nape covered with light hair and his red neck it seemed to rostóv 
that bogdánich was only pretending not to notice him and that his whole aim now 
was to test the courage so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily 
then it seemed to him that bogdánich rode so near in order to show him 
his courage next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate 
attack just to punish then he imagined how after the attack bogdánich would come up 
to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation the 
high shouldered figure of zherkóv familiar to the pávlograds as he had but recently left 
their regiment rode up to the colonel after his dismissal from headquarters zherkóv had not 
remained in the regiment saying he was not such a fool as to slave at 
the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and 
had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagratión he now came 
to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard he 
said addressing enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades 
is an order to stop and fire the bridge order to who asked the colonel 
morosely myself know who replied the cornet in a serious tone the prince told me 
to and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge 
zherkóv was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel 
of hussars with the same order after him the stout nesvítski came galloping up on 
a cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight this colonel he shouted as he 
approached told you to fire the bridge and now someone has gone and blundered they 
are all beside themselves over there and one make anything out the colonel deliberately stopped 
the regiment and turned to nesvítski spoke to me of inflammable material said he you 
said nothing about firing it my dear sir said nesvítski as he drew up taking 
off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand i 
telling you to fire the bridge when inflammable material had been put in position am 
not your sir mr staff officer and you did not tell me to burn the 
bridge i know the service and it is my habit orders strictly to obey you 
said the bridge would be burned but who would burn it i could not know 
by the holy spirit always the way said nesvítski with a wave of the hand 
did you get here said he turning to zherkóv the same business but you are 
damp let me wring you out were saying mr staff officer continued the colonel in 
an offended tone interrupted the officer of the suite must be quick or the enemy 
will bring up his guns to use grapeshot the colonel looked silently at the officer 
of the suite at the stout staff officer and at zherkóv and he frowned will 
the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in 
spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right 
thing striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame 
for everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron that in which rostóv 
was serving under denísov to return to the bridge just as i thought said rostóv 
to himself wishes to test me his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his 
face him see whether i am a coward he thought again on all the bright 
faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire 
rostóv watched his enemy the colonel find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture 
but the colonel did not once glance at rostóv and looked as he always did 
when at the front solemn and stern then came the word of command sharp look 
sharp several voices repeated around him their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs 
jingling the hussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the men were 
crossing themselves rostóv no longer looked at the colonel he had no time he was 
afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraid that his heart stood still his 
hand trembled as he gave his horse into an charge and he felt the blood 
rush to his heart with a thud denísov rode past him leaning back and shouting 
something rostóv saw nothing but the hussars running all around him their spurs catching and 
their sabers clattering shouted someone behind him rostóv did not think what this call for 
stretchers meant he ran on trying only to be ahead of the others but just 
at the bridge not looking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud 
stumbled and fell on his hands the others outstripped him boss zides captain he heard 
the voice of the colonel who having ridden ahead had pulled up his horse near 
the bridge with a triumphant cheerful face rostóv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches 
looked at his enemy and was about to run on thinking that the farther he 
went to the front the better but bogdánich without looking at or recognizing rostóv shouted 
to him that running on the middle of the bridge to the right come back 
cadet he cried angrily and turning to denísov who showing off his courage had ridden 
on to the planks of the bridge run risks captain you should dismount he said 
every bullet has its billet answered váska denísov turning in his saddle meanwhile nesvítski zherkóv 
and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots 
watching now the small group of men with yellow shakos dark green jackets braided with 
cord and blue riding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then at what 
was approaching in the distance from the opposite blue uniforms and groups with horses easily 
recognizable as artillery they burn the bridge or not get there first will they get 
there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot range and wipe 
them out these were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground 
above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking the bridge and the hussars in 
the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their 
bayonets and guns the hussars will get it hot said nesvítski are within grapeshot range 
now have taken so many men said the officer of the suite enough answered nesvítski 
smart fellows could have done the job just as well your excellency put in zherkóv 
his eyes fixed on the hussars but still with that naïve air that made it 
impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest your excellency how 
you look at things send two men and who then would give us the vladímir 
medal and ribbon but now even if they do get peppered the squadron may be 
recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon our bogdánich knows how things are 
done now said the officer of the suite grapeshot he pointed to the french guns 
the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly removed on the french side amid 
the groups with cannon a cloud of smoke appeared then a second and a third 
almost simultaneously and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was 
seen then two reports one after another and a third oh groaned nesvítski as if 
in fierce pain seizing the officer of the suite by the arm a man has 
fallen fallen fallen i think i were tsar i would never go to war said 
nesvítski turning away the french guns were hastily reloaded the infantry in their blue uniforms 
advanced toward the bridge at a run smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals and 
grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge but this time nesvítski could not see what 
was happening there as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it the hussars had 
succeeded in setting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them 
no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone 
to fire at the french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the 
hussars got back to their horses two were misdirected and the shot went too high 
but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked 
three of them over rostóv absorbed by his relations with bogdánich had paused on the 
bridge not knowing what to do there was no one to hew down as he 
had always imagined battles to himself nor could he help to fire the bridge because 
he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers he stood 
looking about him when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts 
were being spilt and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a 
groan rostóv ran up to him with the others again someone shouted four men seized 
the hussar and began lifting him for sake let me alone cried the wounded man 
but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher nicholas rostóv turned away and 
as if searching for something gazed into the distance at the waters of the danube 
at the sky and at the sun how beautiful the sky looked how blue how 
calm and how deep how bright and glorious was the setting sun with what soft 
glitter the waters of the distant danube shone and fairer still were the faraway blue 
mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious gorges and the pine forests veiled in 
the mist of their summits there was peace and happiness should wish for nothing else 
nothing if only i were there thought rostóv myself alone and in that sunshine there 
is so much happiness but here groans suffering fear and this uncertainty and hurry are 
shouting again and again are all running back somewhere and i shall run with them 
and it death is here above me and around another instant and i shall never 
again see the sun this water that gorge at that instant the sun began to 
hide behind the clouds and other stretchers came into view before rostóv and the fear 
of death and of the stretchers and love of the sun and of life all 
merged into one feeling of sickening agitation lord god thou who art in that heaven 
save forgive and protect me rostóv whispered the hussars ran back to the men who 
held their horses their voices sounded louder and calmer the stretchers disappeared from sight fwiend 
so smelt powdah shouted váska denísov just above his ear all over but i am 
a a coward thought rostóv and sighing deeply he took rook his horse which stood 
resting one foot from the orderly and began to mount that grapeshot he asked denísov 
and no mistake cried denísov worked like wegular bwicks and nasty work an pleasant work 
hacking away at the dogs but this sort of thing is the very devil with 
them shooting at you like a target and denísov rode up to a group that 
had stopped near rostóv composed of the colonel nesvítski zherkóv and the officer from the 
suite it seems that no one has noticed thought rostóv and this was true no 
one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire 
for the first time had experienced something for you to report said zherkóv if i 
get promoted to a sublieutenancy the prince that i the bridge fired said the colonel 
triumphantly and gaily if he asks about the losses trifle said the colonel in his 
bass voice hussars wounded and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy 
smile and pronouncing the phrase with ringing distinctness chapter ix pursued by the french army 
of a hundred thousand men under the command of bonaparte encountering a population that was 
unfriendly to it losing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of supplies and compelled 
to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen the russian army 
of thirty five thousand men commanded by kutúzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube stopping 
where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to 
enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment there had been actions at lambach 
amstetten and melk but despite the courage and even by the which the russians fought 
the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat austrian troops that 
had escaped capture at ulm and had joined kutúzov at braunau now separated from the 
russian army and kutúzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces the 
defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of instead of an offensive the 
plan of which carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics had been 
handed to kutúzov when he was in vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the sole and 
almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that 
were advancing from russia without losing his army as mack had done at ulm on 
the twenty eighth of october kutúzov with his army crossed to the left bank of 
the danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between 
himself and the main body of the french on the thirtieth he attacked division which 
was on the left bank and broke it up in this action for the first 
time trophies were taken banners cannon and two enemy generals for the first time after 
a retreat the russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held 
the field but had repulsed the french though the troops were ill clad exhausted and 
had lost a third of their number in killed wounded sick and stragglers though a 
number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube 
with a letter in which kutúzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and 
though the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military hospitals could no 
longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet the stand made at krems and the 
victory over mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably throughout the whole army and 
at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns 
from russia of some victory gained by the austrians and of the retreat of the 
frightened bonaparte prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian general 
schmidt who was killed in the action his horse had been wounded under him and 
his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet as a mark of the commander in 
special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the austrian court 
now no longer at vienna which was threatened by the french but at brünn despite 
his apparently delicate build prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very 
muscular men and on the night of the battle having arrived at krems excited but 
not weary with dispatches from dokhtúrov to kutúzov he was sent immediately with a special 
dispatch to brünn to be so sent meant not only a reward but an important 
step toward promotion the night was dark but starry the road showed black in the 
snow that had fallen the previous day of the battle reviewing his impressions of the 
recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create 
or recalling the send off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow 
officers prince andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a 
man who has at length begun to attain a long desired happiness as soon as 
he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and 
the sensation of victory then he began to imagine that the russians were running away 
and that he himself was killed but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of 
joy as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary 
the french had run away he again recalled all the details of the victory and 
his own calm courage during the battle and feeling reassured he dozed off the dark 
starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning the snow was thawing in the 
sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sides of the road were forests of 
different kinds fields and villages at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy 
of russian wounded the russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the 
front cart shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse in each of the long 
german carts six or more pale dirty bandaged men were being jolted over the stony 
road some of them were talking he heard russian words others were eating bread the 
more severely wounded looked silently with the languid interest of sick children at the envoy 
hurrying past them prince andrew told his driver to stop and asked a soldier in 
what action they had been wounded before yesterday on the danube answered the soldier prince 
andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces for them all 
he said to the officer who came up well soon lads he continued turning to 
the soldiers plenty to do still news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start 
a conversation news go on he shouted to the driver and they galloped on it 
was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved streets of brünn and 
found himself surrounded by high buildings the lights of shops houses and street lamps fine 
carriages and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so 
attractive to a soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and sleepless night prince 
andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than 
he had done the day before only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed 
one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity he again vividly recalled the details of the 
battle no longer dim but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined 
himself stating them to the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casual questions that might 
be put to him and the answers he would give he expected to be at 
once presented to the emperor at the chief entrance to the palace however an official 
came running out to meet him and learning that he was a special messenger led 
him to another entrance the right from the corridor euer hochgeboren there you will find 
the adjutant on duty said the official will conduct you to the minister of war 
the adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wait and went in to 
the minister of war five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered 
prince andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war 
was at work the adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off 
any attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger prince joyous feeling was 
considerably weakened as he approached the door of the room he felt offended and without 
his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was 
quite uncalled for his fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which 
gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister from the smell of 
powder they probably think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes narrowed disdainfully 
he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly deliberate steps this feeling 
of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading 
some papers and making pencil notes on them and for the first two or three 
minutes taking no notice of his arrival a wax candle stood at each side of 
the bent bald head with its gray temples he went on reading to the end 
without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps 
this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him the papers and still 
taking no notice of the special messenger prince andrew felt that either the actions of 
army interested the minister of war less than any of the other matters he was 
concerned with or he wanted to give the russian special messenger that impression that is 
a matter of perfect indifference to me he thought the minister drew the remaining papers 
together arranged them evenly and then raised his head he had an intellectual and distinctive 
head but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm intelligent expression on his 
face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him his face took on 
the stupid artificial smile which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a 
man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another general field marshal kutúzov he 
asked hope it is good news there has been an encounter with mortier a victory 
it was high time he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began 
to read it with a mournful expression my god my god schmidt he exclaimed in 
german a calamity what a calamity having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on 
the table and looked at prince andrew evidently considering something what a calamity you say 
the affair was decisive but mortier is not captured again he pondered am very glad 
you have brought good news though death is a heavy price to pay for the 
victory his majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today i thank 
you you must have a rest be at the levee tomorrow after the parade however 
i will let you know the stupid smile which had left his face while he 
was speaking reappeared revoir thank you very much his majesty will probably desire to see 
you he added bowing his head when prince andrew left the palace he felt that 
all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in 
the indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant the whole tenor 
of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long 
past chapter x prince andrew stayed at brünn with bilíbin a russian acquaintance of his 
in the diplomatic service my dear prince i could not have a more welcome visitor 
said bilíbin as he came out to meet prince andrew put the things in my 
bedroom said he to the servant who was ushering bolkónski in a messenger of victory 
eh splendid and i am sitting here ill as you see after washing and dressing 
prince andrew came into the luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for 
him bilíbin settled down comfortably beside the fire after his journey and the campaign during 
which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements 
of life prince andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as 
he had been accustomed to from childhood besides it was pleasant after his reception by 
the austrians to speak if not in russian for they were speaking french at least 
with a russian who would he supposed share the general russian antipathy to the austrians 
which was then particularly strong bilíbin was a man of thirty five a bachelor and 
of the same circle as prince andrew they had known each other previously in petersburg 
but had become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutúzov just as 
prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military 
profession so to an even greater extent bilíbin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic 
career he was still a young man but no longer a young diplomat as he 
had entered the service at the age of sixteen had been in paris and copenhagen 
and now held a rather important post in vienna both the foreign minister and our 
ambassador in vienna knew him and valued him he was not one of those many 
diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities avoid doing certain things and 
speak french he was one of those who liking work knew how to do it 
and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table he 
worked well whatever the import of his work it was not the question for but 
the question that interested him what the diplomatic matter might be he did not care 
but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular memorandum or report skillfully pointedly 
and elegantly services were valued not only for what he wrote but also for his 
skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres bilíbin liked conversation as 
he liked work only when it could be made elegantly witty in society he always 
awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when 
that was possible his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original finished phrases of general 
interest these sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable 
form as if intentionally so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room 
to drawing room and in fact witticisms were hawked about in the viennese drawing rooms 
and often had an influence on matters considered important his thin worn sallow face was 
covered with deep wrinkles which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips 
of fingers after a russian bath the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play 
of expression on his face now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his 
eyebrows were lifted then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks 
his small deep set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight now tell me about 
your exploits said he bolkónski very modestly without once mentioning himself described the engagement and 
his reception by the minister of war received me and my news as one receives 
a dog in a game of skittles said he in conclusion bilíbin smiled and the 
wrinkles on his face disappeared mon cher he remarked examining his nails from a distance 
and puckering the skin above his left eye la haute estime que je professe pour 
the orthodox russian army que votre victoire pas des plus victorieuses my dear fellow with 
all my respect for the orthodox russian army i must say that your victory was 
not particularly victorious he went on talking in this way in french uttering only those 
words in russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis now you with 
all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortier and his one division and even then 
mortier slips through your fingers the victory seriously said prince andrew can at any rate 
say without boasting that it was a little better than at ulm you capture one 
just one marshal for us not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness 
of a parade we had expected as i told you to get at their rear 
by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon 
why you do it at seven in the morning you ought to have been there 
at seven in the morning returned bilíbin with a smile ought to have been there 
at seven in the morning did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic 
methods that he had better leave genoa alone retorted prince andrew in the same tone 
know interrupted bilíbin thinking very easy to take marshals sitting on a sofa by the 
fire that is true but still why you capture him so be surprised if not 
only the minister of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and king 
francis is not much delighted by your victory even i a poor secretary of the 
russian embassy do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my 
franz a thaler or let him go with his liebchen to the prater true we 
have no prater here he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead 
is now my turn to ask you mon cher said bolkónski confess i do not 
understand perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence but i make it 
out mack loses a whole army the archduke ferdinand and the archduke karl give no 
signs of life and make blunder after blunder kutúzov alone at last gains a real 
victory destroying the spell of the invincibility of the french and the minister of war 
does not even care to hear the details just it my dear fellow you see 
hurrah for the tsar for russia for the orthodox greek faith all that is beautiful 
but what do we i mean the austrian court care for your victories bring us 
nice news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand one as good as 
another as you know and even if it is only over a fire brigade of 
that will be another story and fire off some cannon but this sort of thing 
seems done on purpose to vex us the archduke karl does nothing the archduke ferdinand 
disgraces himself you abandon vienna give up its much as to say is with us 
but heaven help you and your capital the one general whom we all loved schmidt 
you expose to a bullet and then you congratulate us on the victory admit that 
more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived as if it had been 
done on purpose on purpose besides suppose you did gain a brilliant victory if even 
the archduke karl gained a victory what effect would that have on the general course 
of events too late now when vienna is occupied by the french army occupied vienna 
occupied only occupied but bonaparte is at schönbrunn and the count our dear count vrbna 
goes to him for orders after the fatigues and impressions of the journey his reception 
and especially after having dined bolkónski felt that he could not take in the full 
significance of the words he heard lichtenfels was here this morning bilíbin continued showed me 
a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna was fully described prince 
murat et tout le tremblement you see that your victory is not a matter for 
great rejoicing and that you be received as a savior i care about that i 
care at all said prince andrew beginning to understand that his news of the battle 
before krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall 
of capital is it vienna was taken what of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead 
and prince auersperg we heard reports that prince auersperg was defending vienna he said auersperg 
is on this on our side of the river and is defending it very badly 
i think but still he is defending us but vienna is on the other side 
no the bridge has not yet been taken and i hope it will not be 
for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up otherwise we 
should long ago have been in the mountains of bohemia and you and your army 
would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires still this does 
not mean that the campaign is over said prince andrew i think it is the 
bigwigs here think so too but they say so it will be as i said 
at the beginning of the campaign it be your skirmishing at dürrenstein or gunpowder at 
all that will decide the matter but those who devised it said bilíbin quoting one 
of his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead and pausing only question is 
what will come of the meeting between the emperor alexander and the king of prussia 
in berlin if prussia joins the allies hand will be forced and there will be 
war if not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the 
new campo formio are to be drawn up an extraordinary genius prince andrew suddenly exclaimed 
clenching his small hand and striking the table with it what luck the man has 
said bilíbin inquiringly puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say 
something witty he repeated accentuating the u think however now that he lays down laws 
for austria at schönbrunn il faut lui faire grâce de i shall certainly adopt an 
innovation and call him simply bonaparte must let him off the u joking apart said 
prince andrew you really think the campaign is over is what i think austria has 
been made a fool of and she is not used to it she will retaliate 
and she has been fooled in the first place because her provinces have been say 
the holy russian army loots army is destroyed her capital taken and all this for 
the beaux yeux of his sardinian majesty and is between instinctively feel that we are 
being deceived my instinct tells me of negotiations with france and projects for peace a 
secret peace concluded separately fine eyes cried prince andrew would be too base we live 
we shall see replied bilíbin his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the 
conversation was at an end when prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and 
lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant 
pillows he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far far 
away from him the alliance with prussia treachery new triumph levee and parade and the 
audience with the emperor francis occupied his thoughts he closed his eyes and immediately a 
sound of cannonading of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his 
ears and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the 
hill the french were firing and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward 
beside schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around and he experienced tenfold the joy 
of living as he had not done since childhood he woke up that all happened 
he said and smiling happily to himself like a child he fell into a deep 
youthful slumber chapter xi next day he woke late recalling his recent impressions the first 
thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to 
the emperor francis he remembered the minister of war the polite austrian adjutant bilíbin and 
last conversation having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform which he 
had not worn for a long time he went into study fresh animated and handsome 
with his hand bandaged in the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps with 
prince hippolyte kurágin who was a secretary to the embassy bolkónski was already acquainted bilíbin 
introduced him to the others the gentlemen assembled at were young wealthy gay society men 
who here as in vienna formed a special set which bilíbin their leader called les 
nôtres this set consisting almost exclusively of diplomats evidently had its own interests which had 
nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society to certain women 
and to the official side of the service these gentlemen received prince andrew as one 
of themselves an honor they did not extend to many from politeness and to start 
conversation they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle and then 
the talk went off into merry jests and gossip ours the best of it was 
said one telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat the chancellor told him flatly 
that his appointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard 
it can you fancy the figure he cut the worst of it am giving kurágin 
away to that that man suffers and this don juan wicked fellow is taking advantage 
of it prince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its 
arm he began to laugh me about that he said you don juan you serpent 
cried several voices bolkónski know said bilíbin turning to prince andrew all the atrocities of 
the french army i nearly said of the russian army are nothing compared to what 
this man has been doing among the women femme est la compagne de announced prince 
hippolyte and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs is companion bilíbin and 
the rest of burst out laughing in face and prince andrew saw that hippolyte of 
had to had almost been jealous on his account was the butt of this set 
i must give you a treat bilíbin whispered to bolkónski is exquisite when he discusses 
should see his gravity he sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking 
to him about politics prince andrew and the others gathered round these two berlin cabinet 
cannot express a feeling of alliance began hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others 
expressing as in its last note you understand besides unless his majesty the emperor derogates 
from the principle of our alliance i have not finished he said to prince andrew 
seizing him by the arm believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention and he 
paused one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of november 18 that is how 
it will end and he released arm to indicate that he had now quite finished 
i know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth said bilíbin and 
the mop of hair on his head moved with satisfaction everybody laughed and hippolyte louder 
than anyone he was evidently distressed and breathed painfully but could not restrain the wild 
laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features now gentlemen said bilíbin is my guest in 
this house and in brünn itself i want to entertain him as far as i 
can with all the pleasures of life here if we were in vienna it would 
be easy but here in this wretched moravian hole it is more difficult and i 
beg you all to help me attractions must be shown him you can undertake the 
theater i society and you hippolyte of course the women must let him see amelie 
exquisite said one of kissing his finger tips general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier 
to more humane interests said bilíbin shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your 
hospitality gentlemen it is already time for me to go replied prince andrew looking at 
his watch to the emperor oh oh au revoir bolkónski au revoir prince come back 
early to dinner cried several voices take you in hand speaking to the emperor try 
as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the 
routes indicated said bilíbin accompanying him to the hall should like to speak well of 
them but as far as i know the facts i replied bolkónski smiling talk as 
much as you can anyway he has a passion for giving audiences but he does 
not like talking himself and do it as you will see chapter xii at the 
levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he had been told to and 
the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with 
his long head but after it was over the adjutant he had seen the previous 
day ceremoniously informed bolkónski that the emperor desired to give him an audience the emperor 
francis received him standing in the middle of the room before the conversation began prince 
andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor seemed confused and blushed as if 
not knowing what to say me when did the battle begin he asked hurriedly prince 
andrew replied then followed other questions just as simple kutúzov well when had he left 
krems and so on the emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put 
a given number of answers to these questions as was only too evident did not 
interest him what did the battle begin asked the emperor cannot inform your majesty at 
what the battle began at the front but at dürrenstein where i was our attack 
began after five in the afternoon replied bolkónski growing more animated and expecting that he 
would have a chance to give a reliable account which he had ready in his 
mind of all he knew and had seen but the emperor smiled and interrupted him 
many miles where to where your majesty dürrenstein to krems and a half miles your 
majesty french have abandoned the left bank to the scouts the last of them crossed 
on rafts during the night there sufficient forage in krems has not been supplied to 
the extent the emperor interrupted him what was general schmidt killed seven i believe seven 
very sad very sad the emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed prince andrew withdrew and 
was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard 
friendly words adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace and offered him 
his own house the minister of war came up and congratulated him on the maria 
theresa order of the third grade which the emperor was conferring on him the chamberlain 
invited him to see her majesty the archduchess also wished to see him he did 
not know whom to answer and for a few seconds collected his thoughts then the 
russian ambassador took him by the shoulder led him to the window and began to 
talk to him contrary to forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received a 
thanksgiving service was arranged kutúzov was awarded the grand cross of maria theresa and the 
whole army received rewards bolkónski was invited everywhere and had to spend the whole morning 
calling on the principal austrian dignitaries between four and five in the afternoon having made 
all his calls he was returning to house thinking out a letter to his father 
about the battle and his visit to brünn at the door he found a vehicle 
half full of luggage franz man was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of 
the front door before returning to prince andrew had gone to a bookshop to provide 
himself with some books for the campaign and had spent some time in the shop 
is it he asked your excellency said franz with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the 
vehicle are to move on still farther the scoundrel is again at our heels what 
asked prince andrew bilíbin came out to meet him his usually calm face showed excitement 
now confess that this is delightful said he affair of the thabor bridge at vienna 
they have crossed without striking a blow prince andrew could not understand where do you 
come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows come from the 
i heard nothing there you see that everybody is packing up did not what is 
it all about inquired prince andrew impatiently it all about why the french have crossed 
the bridge that auersperg was defending and the bridge was not blown up so murat 
is now rushing along the road to brünn and will be here in a day 
or two here but why did they not blow up the bridge if it was 
mined is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows why bolkónski shrugged 
his shoulders if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost 
it will be cut off said he just it answered bilíbin the french entered vienna 
as i told you very well next day which was yesterday those gentlemen messieurs les 
maréchaux murat lannes and belliard mount and ride to the bridge observe that all three 
are gascons says one of them know the thabor bridge is mined and doubly mined 
and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand 
men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross but 
it will please our sovereign the emperor napoleon if we take this bridge so let 
us three go and take it say the others and off they go and take 
the bridge cross it and now with their whole army are on this side of 
the danube marching on us you and your lines of communication the marshalls jesting said 
prince andrew sadly and seriously this news grieved him and yet he was pleased as 
soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopeless situation it 
occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of 
this position that here was the toulon that would lift him from the ranks of 
obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame listening to bilíbin he was 
already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war 
council which would be the only one that could save the army and how he 
alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan this jesting he said am 
not jesting bilíbin went on is truer or sadder these gentlemen ride onto the bridge 
alone and wave white handkerchiefs they assure the officer on duty that they the marshals 
are on their way to negotiate with prince auersperg he lets them enter the tête 
de pont they spin him a thousand gasconades saying that the war is over that 
the emperor francis is arranging a meeting with bonaparte that they desire to see prince 
auersperg and so on the officer sends for auersperg these gentlemen embrace the officers crack 
jokes sit on the cannon and meanwhile a french battalion gets to the bridge unobserved 
flings the bags of incendiary material into the water and approaches the tête de pont 
at length appears the lieutenant general our dear prince auersperg von mautern himself foe flower 
of the austrian army hero of the turkish wars hostilities are ended we can shake 
one hand the emperor napoleon burns with impatience to make prince acquaintance in a word 
those gentlemen gascons indeed so bewildered him with fine words and he is so flattered 
by his rapidly established intimacy with the french marshals and so dazzled by the sight 
of mantle and ostrich plumes voit que du feu et oublie celui devait faire faire 
sur 2 in spite of the animation of his speech bilíbin did not forget to 
pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation french battalion rushes to 
the bridgehead spikes the guns and the bridge is taken but what is best of 
all he went on his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story 
that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to 
fire the mines and blow up the bridge this sergeant seeing that the french troops 
were running onto the bridge was about to fire but lannes stayed his hand the 
sergeant who was evidently wiser than his general goes up to auersperg and says you 
are being deceived here are the french murat seeing that all is lost if the 
sergeant is allowed to speak turns to auersperg with feigned astonishment he is a true 
gascon and says recognize the world famous austrian discipline if you allow a subordinate to 
address you like that it was a stroke of genius prince auersperg feels his dignity 
at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested come you must own that this 
affair of the thabor bridge is delightful it is not exactly stupidity nor rascality bridgehead 
2 that their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to 
be firing at the enemy may be treachery said prince andrew vividly imagining the gray 
overcoats wounds the smoke of gunpowder the sounds of firing and the glory that awaited 
him that either that puts the court in too bad a light replied bilíbin not 
treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it is just as at ulm it is seemed to 
be trying to find the right expression du mack nous sommes mackés it is it 
is a bit of mack we are macked he concluded feeling that he had produced 
a good epigram a fresh one that would be repeated his hitherto puckered brow became 
smooth as a sign of pleasure and with a slight smile he began to examine 
his nails are you off to he said suddenly to prince andrew who had risen 
and was going toward his room am going away to the army you meant to 
stay another two days now i am off at once and prince andrew after giving 
directions about his departure went to his room you know mon cher said bilíbin following 
him have been thinking about you why are you going and in proof of the 
conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face prince andrew looked inquiringly 
at him and gave no reply are you going i know you think it your 
duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger i understand 
that mon cher it is heroism at all said prince andrew as you are a 
philosopher be a consistent one look at the other side of the question and you 
will see that your duty on the contrary is to take care of yourself leave 
it to those who are no longer fit for anything else you have not been 
ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here therefore you can stay and 
go with us wherever our ill luck takes us they say we are going to 
olmütz and olmütz is a very decent town you and i will travel comfortably in 
my calèche stop joking bilíbin cried bolkónski am speaking sincerely as a friend consider where 
and why are you going when you might remain here you are faced by one 
of two things and the skin over his left temple puckered you will not reach 
your regiment before peace is concluded or you will share defeat and disgrace with whole 
army and bilíbin unwrinkled his temple feeling that the dilemma was insoluble cannot argue about 
it replied prince andrew coldly but he thought am going to save the army dear 
fellow you are a hero said bilíbin chapter xiii that same night having taken leave 
of the minister of war bolkónski set off to rejoin the army not knowing where 
he would find it and fearing to be captured by the french on the way 
to krems in brünn everybody attached to the court was packing up and the heavy 
baggage was already being dispatched to olmütz near hetzelsdorf prince andrew struck the high road 
along which the russian army was moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder 
the road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in 
a carriage prince andrew took a horse and a cossack from a cossack commander and 
hungry and weary making his way past the baggage wagons rode in search of the 
commander in chief and of his own luggage very sinister reports of the position of 
the army reached him as he went along and the appearance of the troops in 
their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors armée russe que de a transportée des extrémités de 
nous allons lui faire éprouver le même le sort de he remembered these words in 
address to his army at the beginning of the campaign and they awoke in him 
astonishment at the genius of his hero a feeling of wounded pride and a hope 
of glory should there be nothing left but to die he thought if need be 
i shall do it no worse than others russian army which has been brought from 
the ends of the earth by english gold we shall cause to share the same 
the fate of the army at ulm he looked with disdain at the endless confused 
mass of detachments carts guns artillery and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds 
overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road three and sometimes four abreast from all 
sides behind and before as far as ear could reach there were the rattle of 
wheels the creaking of carts and gun carriages the tramp of horses the crack of 
whips shouts the urging of horses and the swearing of soldiers orderlies and officers all 
along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen some flayed some 
not and broken down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something and again 
soldiers straggling from their companies crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages or 
returned from them dragging sheep fowls hay and bulging sacks at each ascent or descent 
of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant 
soldiers floundering knee deep in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves whips cracked hoofs 
slipped traces broke and lungs were strained with shouting the officers directing the march rode 
backward and forward between the carts their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar 
and one saw by their faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this 
disorder is our dear orthodox russian army thought bolkónski recalling words wishing to find out 
where the commander in chief was he rode up to a convoy directly opposite to 
him came a strange one horse vehicle evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any 
available materials and looking like something between a cart a cabriolet and a calèche a 
soldier was driving and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the 
leather hood of the vehicle prince andrew rode up and was just putting his question 
to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman 
in the vehicle an officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was 
driving the vehicle for trying to get ahead of others and the strokes of his 
whip fell on the apron of the equipage the woman screamed piercingly seeing prince andrew 
she leaned out from behind the apron and waving her thin arms from under the 
woolen shawl cried aide de camp mr aide de camp for sake protect me what 
will become of us i am the wife of the doctor of the seventh chasseurs 
they let us pass we are left behind and have lost our people flatten you 
into a pancake shouted the angry officer to the soldier back with your slut aide 
de camp help me what does it all mean screamed the wife let this cart 
pass you see a woman said prince andrew riding up to the officer the officer 
glanced at him and without replying turned again to the soldier teach you to push 
on back them pass i tell you repeated prince andrew compressing his lips who are 
you cried the officer turning on him with tipsy rage are you are you in 
command here eh i am commander here not you go back or flatten you into 
a pancake repeated he this expression evidently pleased him was a nice snub for the 
little aide de camp came a voice from behind prince andrew saw that the officer 
was in that state of senseless tipsy rage when a man does not know what 
he is saying he saw that his championship of the wife in her queer trap 
might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the ridicule but his 
instinct urged him on before the officer finished his sentence prince andrew his face distorted 
with fury rode up to him and raised his riding whip ly the officer flourished 
his arm and hastily rode away all the fault of these fellows on the staff 
that this disorder he muttered as you like prince andrew without lifting his eyes rode 
hastily away from the wife who was calling him her deliverer and recalling with a 
sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the 
village where he was told who the commander in chief was on reaching the village 
he dismounted and went to the nearest house intending to rest if but for a 
moment eat something and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused 
his mind is a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking as 
he went up to the window of the first house when a familiar voice called 
him by name he turned round handsome face looked out of the little window nesvítski 
moving his moist lips as he chewed something and flourishing his arm called him to 
enter bolkónski you hear eh come quick he shouted entering the house prince andrew saw 
nesvítski and another adjutant having something to eat they hastily turned round to him asking 
if he had any news on their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm this 
was particularly noticeable on usually laughing countenance is the commander in chief asked bolkónski in 
that house answered the adjutant is it true that peace and capitulation asked nesvítski was 
going to ask you i know nothing except that it was all i could do 
to get here we my dear boy terrible i was wrong to laugh at mack 
getting it still worse said nesvítski sit down and have something to eat be able 
to find either your baggage or anything else now prince and god only knows where 
your man peter is said the other adjutant are headquarters are to spend the night 
in znaim i have got all i need into packs for two horses said nesvítski 
made up splendid packs for to cross the bohemian mountains with a bad lookout old 
fellow but the matter with you you must be ill to shiver like that he 
added noticing that prince andrew winced as at an electric shock nothing replied prince andrew 
he had just remembered his recent encounter with the wife and the convoy officer is 
the commander in chief doing here he asked make out at all said nesvítski all 
i can make out is that everything is abominable abominable quite abominable said prince andrew 
and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was passing by 
carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite with their cossacks who were talking 
loudly together prince andrew entered the passage kutúzov himself he was told was in the 
house with prince bagratión and weyrother weyrother was the austrian general who had succeeded schmidt 
in the passage little kozlóvski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk 
the clerk with cuffs turned up was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards 
face looked too had evidently not slept all night he glanced at prince andrew and 
did not even nod to him line have you written it he continued dictating to 
the clerk kiev grenadiers podolian write so fast your honor said the clerk glancing angrily 
and disrespectfully at kozlóvski through the door came the sounds of voice excited and dissatisfied 
interrupted by another an unfamiliar voice from the sound of these voices the inattentive way 
kozlóvski looked at him the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk the fact that the 
clerk and kozlóvski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the 
commander in chief and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding the horses near 
the window prince andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen he 
turned to kozlóvski with urgent questions prince said kozlóvski for bagratión about capitulation of the 
sort orders are issued for a battle prince andrew moved toward the door from whence 
voices were heard just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased the 
door opened and kutúzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway 
prince andrew stood right in front of kutúzov but the expression of the commander in 
one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to 
be oblivious of his presence he looked straight at his face without recognizing him have 
you finished said he to kozlóvski moment your excellency bagratión a gaunt middle aged man 
of medium height with a firm impassive face of oriental type came out after the 
commander in chief have the honor to present myself repeated prince andrew rather loudly handing 
kutúzov an envelope from vienna very good later later kutúzov went out into the porch 
with bagratión good by prince said he to bagratión blessing and may christ be with 
you in your great endeavor his face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes 
with his left hand he drew bagratión toward him and with his right on which 
he wore a ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a 
gesture evidently habitual offering his puffy cheek but bagratión kissed him on the neck instead 
be with you kutúzov repeated and went toward his carriage in with me said he 
to bolkónski excellency i should like to be of use here allow me to remain 
with prince detachment in said kutúzov and noticing that bolkónski still delayed he added need 
good officers myself need them myself they got into the carriage and drove for a 
few minutes in silence is still much much before us he said as if with 
an old penetration he understood all that was passing in mind a tenth part of 
his detachment returns i shall thank god he added as if speaking to himself prince 
andrew glanced at face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully 
washed seams of the scar near his temple where an ismail bullet had pierced his 
skull and the empty eye socket he has a right to speak so calmly of 
those death thought bolkónski is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he 
said kutúzov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying 
and sat plunged in thought five minutes later gently swaying on the soft springs of 
the carriage he turned to prince andrew there was not a trace of agitation on 
his face with delicate irony he questioned prince andrew about the details of his interview 
with the emperor about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the krems affair 
and about some ladies they both knew chapter xiv on november 1 kutúzov had received 
through a spy news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position 
the spy reported that the french after crossing the bridge at vienna were advancing in 
immense force upon line of communication with the troops that were arriving from russia if 
kutúzov decided to remain at krems army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would 
cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand and he would 
find himself in the position of mack at ulm if kutúzov decided to abandon the 
road connecting him with the troops arriving from russia he would have to march with 
no road into unknown parts of the bohemian mountains defending himself against superior forces of 
the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with buxhöwden if kutúzov decided to 
retreat along the road from krems to olmütz to unite with the troops arriving from 
russia he risked being forestalled on that road by the french who had crossed the 
vienna bridge and encumbered by his baggage and transport having to accept battle on the 
march against an enemy three times as strong who would hem him in from two 
sides kutúzov chose this latter course the french the spy reported having crossed the vienna 
bridge were advancing by forced marches toward znaim which lay sixty six miles off on 
the line of retreat if he reached znaim before the french there would be great 
hope of saving the army to let the french forestall him at znaim meant the 
exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of ulm or to 
utter destruction but to forestall the french with his whole army was impossible the road 
for the french from vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the road for 
the russians from krems to znaim the night he received the news kutúzov sent vanguard 
four thousand strong to the right across the hills from the krems znaim to the 
vienna znaim road bagratión was to make this march without resting and to halt facing 
vienna with znaim to his rear and if he succeeded in forestalling the french he 
was to delay them as long as possible kutúzov himself with all his transport took 
the road to znaim marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills with his 
hungry ill shod soldiers and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the 
way bagratión came out on the vienna znaim road at hollabrünn a few hours ahead 
of the french who were approaching hollabrünn from vienna kutúzov with his transport had still 
to march for some days before he could reach znaim hence bagratión with his four 
thousand hungry exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that 
came upon him at hollabrünn which was clearly impossible but a freak of fate made 
the impossible possible the success of the trick that had placed the vienna bridge in 
the hands of the french without a fight led murat to try to deceive kutúzov 
in a similar way meeting weak detachment on the znaim road he supposed it to 
be whole army to be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of 
the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna and with this 
object offered a three truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without 
moving murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding and that he therefore offered 
this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed count nostitz the austrian general occupying the advanced posts 
believed emissary and retired leaving division exposed another emissary rode to the russian line to 
announce the peace negotiations and to offer the russian army the three truce bagratión replied 
that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his 
adjutant to kutúzov to report the offer he had received a truce was sole chance 
of gaining time giving exhausted troops some rest and letting the transport and heavy convoys 
whose movements were concealed from the french advance if but one stage nearer znaim the 
offer of a truce gave the only and a quite unexpected chance of saving the 
army on receiving the news he immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode who was in attendance 
on him to the enemy camp wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce 
but also to offer terms of capitulation and meanwhile kutúzov sent his adjutants back to 
hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along 
the krems znaim road exhausted and hungry detachment which alone covered this movement of the 
transport and of the whole army had to remain stationary in face of an enemy 
eight times as strong as itself expectations that the proposals of capitulation which were in 
no way binding might give time for part of the transport to pass and also 
that mistake would very soon be discovered proved correct as soon as bonaparte who was 
at schönbrunn sixteen miles from hollabrünn received dispatch with the proposal of a truce and 
a capitulation he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to murat schönbrunn 25th 
brumaire 1805 at eight in the morning to prince murat i cannot find words to 
express to you my displeasure you command only my advance guard and have no right 
to arrange an armistice without my order you are causing me to lose the fruits 
of a campaign break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy inform him that 
the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so and that no 
one but the emperor of russia has that right if however the emperor of russia 
ratifies that convention i will ratify it but it is only a trick march on 
destroy the russian army you are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery 
the russian aide de camp is an impostor officers are nothing when they have no 
powers this one had none the austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of 
the vienna bridge you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide de camp of 
the emperor napoleon adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to murat bonaparte himself 
not trusting to his generals moved with all the guards to the field of battle 
afraid of letting a ready victim escape and four thousand men merrily lighted campfires dried 
and warmed themselves cooked their porridge for the first time for three days and not 
one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him chapter xv between 
three and four in the afternoon prince andrew who had persisted in his request to 
kutúzov arrived at grunth and reported himself to bagratión adjutant had not yet reached detachment 
and the battle had not yet begun in detachment no one knew anything of the 
general position of affairs they talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility 
others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement bagratión 
knowing bolkónski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant received him with distinction and special 
marks of favor explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day 
or the next and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle 
or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat is 
also very important there will hardly be an engagement today said bagratión as if to 
reassure prince andrew he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn 
a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard but if 
he wishes to stay with me let him be of use here if a brave 
officer thought bagratión prince andrew without replying asked the permission to ride round the position 
to see the disposition of the forces so as to know his bearings should he 
be sent to execute an order the officer on duty a handsome elegantly dressed man 
with a diamond ring on his forefinger who was fond of speaking french though he 
spoke it badly offered to conduct prince andrew on all sides they saw rain soaked 
officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something and soldiers dragging doors benches 
and fencing from the village now prince we stop those fellows said the staff officer 
pointing to the soldiers officers keep them in hand and there he pointed to a 
tent crowd in and sit this morning i turned them all out and now look 
full again i must go there prince and scare them a bit it take a 
moment go in and i will get myself a roll and some cheese said prince 
andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything you mention it prince i 
would have offered you something they dismounted and entered the tent several officers with flushed 
and weary faces were sitting at the table eating and drinking what does this mean 
gentlemen said the staff officer in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated 
the same thing more than once know it do to leave your posts like this 
the prince gave orders that no one should leave his post now you captain and 
he turned to a thin dirty little artillery officer who without his boots he had 
given them to the canteen keeper to dry in only his stockings rose when they 
entered smiling not altogether comfortably you ashamed of yourself captain túshin he continued would think 
that as an artillery officer you would set a good example yet here you are 
without your boots the alarm will be sounded and be in a pretty position without 
your boots the staff officer smiled return to your posts gentlemen all of you all 
he added in a tone of command prince andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at 
the artillery officer túshin who silent and smiling shifting from one stockinged foot to the 
other glanced inquiringly with his large intelligent kindly eyes from prince andrew to the staff 
officer soldiers say it feels easier without boots said captain túshin smiling shyly in his 
uncomfortable position evidently wishing to adopt a jocular tone but before he had finished he 
felt that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off he grew confused return 
to your posts said the staff officer trying to preserve his gravity prince andrew glanced 
again at the artillery small figure there was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather 
comic but extremely attractive the staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode 
on having ridden beyond the village continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various 
regiments they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up the freshly dug clay 
of which showed up red several battalions of soldiers in their shirt sleeves despite the 
cold wind swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants spadefuls of red 
clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands prince andrew 
and the officer rode up looked at the entrenchment and went on again just behind 
it they came upon some dozens of soldiers continually replaced by others who ran from 
the entrenchment they had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot 
to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines des camps monsieur le prince said 
the staff officer is a pleasure one gets in camp prince they rode up the 
opposite hill from there the french could already be seen prince andrew stopped and began 
examining the position our battery said the staff officer indicating the highest point in charge 
of the queer fellow we saw without his boots you can see everything from there 
go there prince you very much i will go on alone said prince andrew wishing 
to rid himself of this staff company trouble yourself further the staff officer remained behind 
and prince andrew rode on alone the farther forward and nearer the enemy he went 
the more orderly and cheerful were the troops the greatest disorder and depression had been 
in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the znaim road seven miles 
away from the french at grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt but 
the nearer prince andrew came to the french lines the more confident was the appearance 
of our troops the soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major 
and company officers were counting the men poking the last man in each section in 
the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up soldiers scattered over the whole 
place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter 
around the fires sat others dressed and undressed drying their shirts and leg bands or 
mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers in one company 
dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler waiting till 
the sample which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer 
who sat on a log before his shelter had been tasted another company a lucky 
one for not all the companies had vodka crowded round a pockmarked broad shouldered sergeant 
major who tilting a keg filled one after another the canteen lids held out to 
him the soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces emptied them 
rolling the vodka in their mouths and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened 
expressions licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats all their 
faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment 
and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half 
of them would be left on the field after passing a chasseur regiment and in 
the lines of the kiev fellows busy with similar peaceful the shelter of the regimental 
commander higher than and different from the others prince andrew came out in front of 
a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man two soldiers held him while 
two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back the 
man shrieked unnaturally a stout major was pacing up and down the line and regardless 
of the screams kept repeating a shame for a soldier to steal a soldier must 
be honest honorable and brave but if he robs his fellows there is no honor 
in him a scoundrel go on go on so the swishing sound of the strokes 
and the desperate but unnatural screams continued on go on said the major a young 
officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man 
and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by prince andrew having reached 
the front line rode along it our front line and that of the enemy were 
far apart on the right and left flanks but in the center where the men 
with a flag of truce had passed that morning the lines were so near together 
that the men could see one faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers 
who formed the picket line on either side there were many curious onlookers who jesting 
and laughing stared at their strange foreign enemies since early an injunction not to approach 
the picket officers had been unable to keep sight seers away the soldiers forming the 
picket line like showmen exhibiting a curiosity no longer looked at the french but paid 
attention to the sight seers and grew weary waiting to be relieved prince andrew halted 
to have a look at the french look there one soldier was saying to another 
pointing to a russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an 
officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier to him jabbering fine 
it all the frenchy can do to keep up with him there now sídorov a 
bit and listen fine answered sídorov who was considered an adept at french the soldier 
to whom the laughers referred was dólokhov prince andrew recognized him and stopped to listen 
to what he was saying dólokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment 
was stationed with his captain then go on go on incited the officer bending forward 
and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him 
please more he saying dólokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into 
a hot dispute with the french grenadier they were naturally talking about the campaign the 
frenchman confusing the austrians with the russians was trying to prove that the russians had 
surrendered and had fled all the way from ulm while dólokhov maintained that the russians 
had not surrendered but had beaten the french have orders to drive you off here 
and we shall drive you off said dólokhov take care you and your cossacks are 
not all captured said the french grenadier the french onlookers and listeners laughed make you 
dance as we did under suvórov said dólokhov vous fera danser est ce chante asked 
a frenchman he singing about ancient history said another guessing that it referred to a 
former war emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught the others began dólokhov 
but the frenchman interrupted him bonaparte he is the emperor sacré nom cried he angrily 
devil skin your emperor and dólokhov swore at him in coarse russian and shouldering his 
musket walked away us go iván lukích he said to the captain the way to 
talk french said the picket soldiers sídorov you have a try sídorov turning to the 
french winked and began to jabber meaningless sounds very fast mala tafa safi muter kaská 
he said trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice ho ho ha ha 
ha ha ouh ouh came peals of such healthy and good humored laughter from the 
soldiers that it infected the french involuntarily so much so that the only thing left 
to do seemed to be to unload the muskets explode the ammunition and all return 
home as quickly as possible but the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses and 
entrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before 
chapter xvi having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left prince andrew 
made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him 
the whole field could be seen here he dismounted and stopped beside the farthest of 
the four unlimbered cannon before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down 
he stood at attention when the officer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured 
monotonous pacing behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and 
bonfires to the left not far from the farthest cannon was a small newly constructed 
wattle shed from which came the sound of voices in eager conversation it was true 
that a view over nearly the whole russian position and the greater part of the 
opened out from this battery just facing it on the crest of the opposite hill 
the village of schön grabern could be seen and in three places to left and 
right the french troops amid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom 
were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill to the left from that 
village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but it was impossible to see 
it clearly with the naked eye our right flank was posted on a rather steep 
incline which dominated the french position our infantry were stationed there and at the farthest 
point the dragoons in the center where battery stood and from which prince andrew was 
surveying the position was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook 
separating us from schön grabern on the left our troops were close to a copse 
in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood the french line 
was wider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on 
both sides behind our position was a steep and deep dip making it difficult for 
artillery and cavalry to retire prince andrew took out his notebook and leaning on the 
cannon sketched a plan of the position he made some notes on two points intending 
to mention them to bagratión his idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in 
the center and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip 
prince andrew being always near the commander in chief closely following the mass movements and 
general orders and constantly studying historical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself the course 
of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline he imagined only important possibilities the 
enemy attacks the right flank he said to himself kiev grenadiers and the podólsk chasseurs 
must hold their position till reserves from the center come up in that case the 
dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack if they attack our center we having the 
center battery on this high ground shall withdraw the left flank under its cover and 
retreat to the dip by echelons so he reasoned all the time he had been 
beside the gun he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly but as often 
happens had not understood a word of what they were saying suddenly however he was 
struck by a voice coming from the shed and its tone was so sincere that 
he could not but listen friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to prince 
andrew a familiar voice i say is that if it were possible to know what 
is beyond death none of us would be afraid of it so friend another a 
younger voice interrupted him or not you escape it anyhow the same one is afraid 
oh you clever people said a third manly voice interrupting them both course you artillery 
men are very wise because you can take everything along with and snacks and the 
owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officer laughed one is afraid continued the 
first speaker he of the familiar voice is afraid of the unknown what it is 
whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky we know there is 
no sky but only an atmosphere the manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer stand 
us some of your herb vodka túshin it said thought prince andrew the captain who 
stood up in the hut without his boots he recognized the agreeable philosophizing voice with 
pleasure herb vodka certainly said túshin still to conceive a future life he did not 
finish just then there was a whistle in the air nearer and nearer faster and 
louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if it had not finished saying what 
was necessary thudded into the ground near the shed with super human force throwing up 
a mass of earth the ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact and immediately 
túshin with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind intelligent 
face rather pale rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly 
voice a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his company buttoning up his coat 
as he ran chapter xvii mounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the battery 
looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball his eyes ran 
rapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of 
the french now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left the 
smoke above it had not yet dispersed two mounted frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up 
the hill a small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill probably 
to strengthen the front line the smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed 
before another puff appeared followed by a report the battle had begun prince andrew turned 
his horse and galloped back to grunth to find prince bagratión he heard the cannonade 
behind him growing louder and more frequent evidently our guns had begun to reply from 
the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place came the report of 
musketry lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with stern letter and murat humiliated and 
anxious to expiate his fault had at once moved his forces to attack the center 
and outflank both the russian wings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the 
emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him has begun here it is 
thought prince andrew feeling the blood rush to his heart where and how will my 
toulon present itself passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka 
a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers 
forming ranks and getting their muskets ready and on all their faces he recognized the 
same eagerness that filled his heart has begun here it is dreadful but enjoyable was 
what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say before he had 
reached the embankments that were being thrown up he saw in the light of the 
dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward him the foremost wearing a cossack cloak and 
lambskin cap and riding a white horse was prince bagratión prince andrew stopped waiting for 
him to come up prince bagratión reined in his horse and recognizing prince andrew nodded 
to him he still looked ahead while prince andrew told him what he had seen 
the feeling has begun here it is was seen even on prince hard brown face 
with its half closed dull sleepy eyes prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that 
impassive face and wished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking and 
feeling at that moment there anything at all behind that impassive face prince andrew asked 
himself as he looked prince bagratión bent his head in sign of agreement with what 
prince andrew told him and said good in a tone that seemed to imply that 
everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen 
prince andrew out of breath with his rapid ride spoke quickly prince bagratión uttering his 
words with an oriental accent spoke particularly slowly as if to impress the fact that 
there was no need to hurry however he put his horse to a trot in 
the direction of battery prince andrew followed with the suite behind prince bagratión rode an 
officer of the suite the personal adjutant zherkóv an orderly officer the staff officer on 
duty riding a fine bobtailed horse and a accountant who had asked permission to be 
present at the battle out of curiosity the accountant a stout full faced man looked 
around him with a naïve smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the 
hussars cossacks and adjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on his horse with 
a convoy saddle wants to see a battle said zherkóv to bolkónski pointing to the 
accountant he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already leave off said 
the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile as if flattered at being made 
the subject of joke and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was is 
very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer he remembered that in french there 
is some peculiar way of addressing a prince but could not get it quite right 
by this time they were all approaching battery and a ball struck the ground in 
front of them that that has fallen asked the accountant with a naïve smile french 
pancake answered zherkóv what they hit with asked the accountant awful he seemed to swell 
with satisfaction he had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling 
which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft f f flop and a cossack 
riding a little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth with his 
horse zherkóv and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their horses away 
the accountant stopped facing the cossack and examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was 
dead but the horse still struggled prince bagratión screwed up his eyes looked round and 
seeing the cause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to say it 
worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse with the care of a skillful 
rider and slightly bending over disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak it 
was an old fashioned saber of a kind no longer in general use prince andrew 
remembered the story of suvórov giving his saber to bagratión in italy and the recollection 
was particularly pleasant at that moment they had reached the battery at which prince andrew 
had been when he examined the battlefield company asked prince bagratión of an artilleryman standing 
by the ammunition wagon he asked company but he really meant you frightened here and 
the artilleryman understood him your excellency shouted the red haired freckled gunner in a merry 
voice standing to attention yes muttered bagratión as if considering something and he rode past 
the limbers to the farthest cannon as he approached a ringing shot issued from it 
deafening him and his suite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they 
could see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to 
its former position a huge broad shouldered gunner number one holding a mop his legs 
far apart sprang to the wheel while number two with a trembling hand placed a 
charge in the mouth the short round shouldered captain túshin stumbling over the tail of 
the gun carriage moved forward and not noticing the general looked out shading his eyes 
with his small hand it two lines more and it will be just right cried 
he in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note ill 
suited to his weak figure two he squeaked medvédev bagratión called to him and túshin 
raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all 
like a military salute but like a benediction approached the general though guns had been 
intended to cannonade the valley he was firing incendiary balls at the village of schön 
grabern visible just opposite in front of which large masses of french were advancing no 
one had given túshin orders where and at what to fire but after consulting his 
sergeant major zakharchénko for whom he had great respect he had decided that it would 
be a good thing to set fire to the village good said bagratión in reply 
to the report and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him the 
french had advanced nearest on our right below the height on which the kiev regiment 
was stationed in the hollow where the rivulet flowed the soul stirring rolling and crackling 
of musketry was heard and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons the officer 
of the suite pointed out to bagratión a french column that was outflanking us to 
the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood prince bagratión ordered two battalions from 
the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank the officer of the suite 
ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away the guns would 
remain without support prince bagratión turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked 
at him in silence it seemed to prince andrew that the remark was just and 
that really no answer could be made to it but at that moment an adjutant 
galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and 
news that immense masses of the french were coming down upon them and that his 
regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince bagratión bowed his 
head in sign of assent and approval he rode off at a walk to the 
right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the french but 
this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the 
dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground as a heavy fire had 
been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly and so had hastened to 
throw some sharpshooters into the wood good said bagratión as he was leaving the battery 
firing was heard on the left also and as it was too far to the 
left flank for him to have time to go there himself prince bagratión sent zherkóv 
to tell the general in command the one who had paraded his regiment before kutúzov 
at braunau that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the 
rear as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the attack very 
long about túshin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all 
was forgotten prince andrew listened attentively to colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders 
he gave them and to his surprise found that no orders were really given but 
that prince bagratión tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity by accident 
or by the will of subordinate commanders was done if not by his direct command 
at least in accord with his intentions prince andrew noticed however that though what happened 
was due to chance and was independent of the will owing to the tact bagratión 
showed his presence was very valuable officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm 
soldiers and officers greeted him gaily grew more cheerful in his presence and were evidently 
anxious to display their courage before him chapter xviii prince bagratión having reached the highest 
point of our right flank began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was 
heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen the nearer they 
got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the 
nearness of the actual battlefield they began to meet wounded men one with a bleeding 
head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under 
the arms there was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood a 
bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth another was walking sturdily by 
himself but without his musket groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been 
hurt while blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle he 
had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering crossing a 
road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground they 
also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded the soldiers were ascending 
the hill breathing heavily and despite the presence were talking loudly and gesticulating in front 
of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke and an officer 
catching sight of bagratión rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back 
bagratión rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there 
drowning the sound of voices and the shouts of command the whole air reeked with 
smoke the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it some were using their 
ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches while others 
were firing though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke 
which there was no wind to carry away a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets 
were often heard is this thought prince andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers be an 
attack for they are not moving it be a they are not drawn up for 
that the commander of the regiment a thin feeble looking old man with a pleasant 
eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes giving him a mild expression rode 
up to bagratión and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest he reported 
that his regiment had been attacked by french cavalry and that though the attack had 
been repulsed he had lost more than half his men he said the attack had 
been repulsed employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment but 
in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that half hour to 
the troops entrusted to him and could not say with certainty whether the attack had 
been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up all he knew was that at 
the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and 
hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted and our men had begun firing they 
were still firing not at the cavalry which had disappeared but at french infantry who 
had come into the hollow and were firing at our men prince bagratión bowed his 
head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected turning 
to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the sixth 
chasseurs whom they had just passed prince andrew was struck by the changed expression on 
prince face at this moment it expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on 
the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before 
plunging into the water the dull sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectation 
of profound thought the round steady eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully not 
resting on anything although his movements were still slow and measured the commander of the 
regiment turned to prince bagratión entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous 
to remain where they were your excellency for sake he kept saying glancing for support 
at an officer of the suite who turned away from him you see and he 
drew attention to the bullets whistling singing and hissing continually around them he spoke in 
the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has 
picked up an ax are used to it but you sir will blister your hands 
he spoke as if those bullets could not kill him and his half closed eyes 
gave still more persuasiveness to his words the staff officer joined in the appeals but 
bagratión did not reply he only gave an order to cease firing and re form 
so as to give room for the two approaching battalions while he was speaking the 
curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow driven by a rising wind began to 
move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand and the hill 
opposite with the french moving about on it opened out before them all eyes fastened 
involuntarily on this french column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground 
one could already see the shaggy caps distinguish the officers from the men and see 
the standard flapping against its staff march splendidly remarked someone in suite the head of 
the column had already descended into the hollow the clash would take place on this 
side of it the remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed 
up and moved to the right from behind it dispersing the laggards came two battalions 
of the sixth chasseurs in fine order before they had reached bagratión the weighty tread 
of the mass of men marching in step could be heard on their left flank 
nearest to bagratión marched a company commander a fine round faced man with a stupid 
and happy same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed at that moment 
he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as 
he passed the commander with the self satisfaction of a man on parade he stepped 
lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along stretching himself to his full height 
without the smallest effort his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who 
were keeping step with him he carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword 
small curved and not like a real weapon and looked now at the superior officers 
and now back at the men without losing step his whole powerful body turning flexibly 
it was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the 
commander in the best possible manner and feeling that he was doing it well he 
was happy left left he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step and 
in time to this with stern but varied faces the wall of soldiers burdened with 
knapsacks and muskets marched in step and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed 
to be repeating to himself at each alternate step left left a fat major skirted 
a bush puffing and falling out of step a soldier who had fallen behind his 
face showing alarm at his defection ran at a trot panting to catch up with 
his company a cannon ball cleaving the air flew over the heads of bagratión and 
his suite and fell into the column to the measure of left up came the 
company voice in jaunty tones the soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the 
ball had fallen and an old trooper on the flank a noncommissioned officer who had 
stopped beside the dead men ran to catch up his line and falling into step 
with a hop looked back angrily and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp 
of feet beating the ground in unison one seemed to hear left left left done 
lads said prince bagratión to do our best your lency came a confused shout from 
the ranks a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on bagratión as 
he shouted with an expression that seemed to say know that ourselves another without looking 
round as though fearing to relax shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on 
the order was given to halt and down knapsacks bagratión rode round the ranks that 
had marched past him and dismounted he gave the reins to a cossack took off 
and handed over his felt coat stretched his legs and set his cap straight the 
head of the french column with its officers leading appeared from below the hill with 
god said bagratión in a resolute sonorous voice turning for a moment to the front 
line and slightly swinging his arms he went forward uneasily over the rough field with 
the awkward gait of a cavalryman prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading 
him forward and experienced great happiness the french were already near prince andrew walking beside 
bagratión could clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets and even their faces he distinctly saw 
an old french officer who with gaitered legs and turned out toes climbed the hill 
with difficulty prince bagratión gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in 
front of the ranks suddenly one shot after another rang out from the french smoke 
appeared all along their uneven ranks and musket shots sounded several of our men fell 
among them the round faced officer who had marched so gaily and complacently but at 
the moment the first report was heard bagratión looked round and shouted rang a long 
drawn shout from our ranks and passing bagratión and racing one another they rushed in 
an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe chapter 
xix the attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank in 
the center forgotten battery which had managed to set fire to the schön grabern village 
delayed the french advance the french were putting out the fire which the wind was 
spreading and thus gave us time to retreat the retirement of the center to the 
other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy 
but the different companies did not get mixed but our consisted of the azóv and 
podólsk infantry and the pávlograd simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under lannes 
and was thrown into confusion bagratión had sent zherkóv to the general commanding that left 
flank with orders to retreat immediately zherkóv not removing his hand from his cap turned 
his horse about and galloped off but no sooner had he left bagratión than his 
courage failed him he was seized by panic and could not go where it was 
dangerous having reached the left flank instead of going to the front where the firing 
was he began to look for the general and his staff where they could not 
possibly be and so did not deliver the order the command of the left flank 
belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment kutúzov had reviewed at braunau and 
in which dólokhov was serving as a private but the command of the extreme left 
flank had been assigned to the commander of the pávlograd regiment in which rostóv was 
serving and a misunderstanding arose the two commanders were much exasperated with one another and 
long after the action had begun on the right flank and the french were already 
advancing were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another but the 
regiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for the impending action from 
privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations 
the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood higher iss dan i in 
rank said the german colonel of the hussars flushing and addressing an adjutant who had 
ridden up let him do what he vill but i cannot sacrifice my hussars bugler 
sount ze retreat but haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling together thundered on 
the right and in the center while the capotes of sharpshooters were already seen crossing 
the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot the general 
in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps and having mounted 
drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the pávlograd commander the commanders 
met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts again colonel said the 
general leave half my men in the wood i beg of you i beg of 
you he repeated occupy the position and prepare for an attack peg of you yourself 
not to mix in vot is not your business suddenly replied the irate colonel you 
vere in the cavalry am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian 
general and if you are not aware of the fact avare your excellency suddenly shouted 
the colonel touching his horse and turning purple in the face you be so goot 
to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot i vish 
to destroy my men for your pleasure forget yourself colonel i am not considering my 
own pleasure and i allow it to be said taking the outburst as a challenge 
to his courage the general expanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to the 
front line as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets they reached 
the front several bullets sped over them and they halted in silence there was nothing 
fresh to be seen from the line for from where they had been before it 
had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and 
broken ground as well as that the french were outflanking our left the general and 
colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle 
each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other both passed the examination 
successfully as there was nothing to be said and neither wished to give occasion for 
it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of 
fire they would have remained there for a long time testing each courage had it 
not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout 
almost behind them in the wood the french had attacked the men collecting wood in 
the copse it was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry 
they were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the french 
however inconvenient the position it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a 
way through for themselves the squadron in which rostóv was serving had scarcely time to 
mount before it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns bridge there 
was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again that terrible dividing line of 
uncertainty and the line separating the living from the between them all were conscious of 
this unseen line and the question whether they would cross it or not and how 
they would cross it agitated them all the colonel rode to the front angrily gave 
some reply to questions put to him by the officers and like a man desperately 
insisting on having his own way gave an order no one said anything definite but 
the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron the command to form up rang 
out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards still no one 
moved the troops of the left flank infantry and hussars alike felt that the commander 
did not himself know what to do and this irresolution communicated itself to the men 
only they would be quick thought rostóv feeling that at last the time had come 
to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from 
his fellow hussars with god lads rang out voice a twot the croups began to 
sway in the front line rook pulled at the reins and started of his own 
accord before him on the right rostóv saw the front lines of his hussars and 
still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to 
be the enemy shots could be heard but some way off came the word of 
command and rostóv felt flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop rostóv anticipated his 
movements and became more and more elated he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of 
him this tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so 
now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible but everything 
was becoming more and more happy and animated how i will slash at him thought 
rostóv gripping the hilt of his saber a a a ah came a roar of 
voices anyone come my way now thought rostóv driving his spurs into rook and letting 
him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy 
was already visible suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron 
rostóv raised his saber ready to strike but at that instant the trooper nikítenko who 
was galloping ahead shot away from him and rostóv felt as in a dream that 
he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same 
spot from behind him bondarchúk an hussar he knew jolted against him and looked angrily 
at him horse swerved and galloped past is it i am not moving i have 
fallen i am killed rostóv asked and answered at the same instant he was alone 
in the middle of a field instead of the moving horses and backs he saw 
nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him there was warm 
blood under his arm i am wounded and the horse is killed rook tried to 
rise on his forelegs but fell back pinning his leg blood was flowing from his 
head he struggled but could not rise rostóv also tried to rise but fell back 
his sabretache having become entangled in the saddle where our men were and where the 
french he did not know there was no one near having disentangled his leg he 
rose on which side was now the line that had so sharply divided the two 
armies he asked himself and could not answer something bad have happened to me he 
wondered as he got up and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was 
hanging on his benumbed left arm the wrist felt as if it were not his 
he examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find blood on it here are people 
coming he thought joyfully seeing some men running toward him will help me in front 
came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned and with 
a hooked nose then came two more and many more running behind one of them 
said something strange not in russian in among the hindmost of these men wearing similar 
shakos was a russian hussar he was being held by the arms and his horse 
was being led behind him must be one of ours a prisoner yes can it 
be that they will take me too who are these men thought rostóv scarcely believing 
his eyes they be french he looked at the approaching frenchmen and though but a 
moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces 
their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes are they 
why are they running can they be coming at me and why to kill me 
me whom everyone is so fond of he remembered his love for him and his 
and his and the intention to kill him seemed impossible perhaps they may do it 
for more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the 
situation the foremost frenchman the one with the hooked nose was already so close that 
the expression of his face could be seen and the excited alien face of that 
man his bayonet hanging down holding his breath and running so lightly frightened rostóv he 
seized his pistol and instead of firing it flung it at the frenchman and ran 
with all his might toward the bushes he did not now run with the feeling 
of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridge but with the 
feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds one single sentiment that of fear for 
his young and happy life possessed his whole being rapidly leaping the furrows he fled 
across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay now and then 
turning his good natured pale young face to look back a shudder of terror went 
through him better not look he thought but having reached the bushes he glanced round 
once more the french had fallen behind and just as he looked round the first 
man changed his run to a walk and turning shouted something loudly to a comrade 
farther back rostóv paused some mistake thought he have wanted to kill me but at 
the same time his left arm felt as heavy as if a seventy pound weight 
were tied to it he could run no more the frenchman also stopped and took 
aim rostóv closed his eyes and stooped down one bullet and then another whistled past 
him he mustered his last remaining strength took hold of his left hand with his 
right and reached the bushes behind these were some russian sharpshooters chapter xx the infantry 
regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out of 
it the different companies getting mixed and retreated as a disorderly crowd one soldier in 
his fear uttered the senseless cry off that is so terrible in battle and that 
word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic cut off lost shouted the 
fugitives the moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the general realized 
that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and the thought that he an exemplary 
officer of many service who had never been to blame might be held responsible at 
headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel his 
own dignity as a general and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard 
for self preservation he clutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped 
to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunately missed him 
his one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct or 
remedy the mistake if he had made one so that he an exemplary officer of 
twenty two service who had never been censured should not be held to blame having 
galloped safely through the french he reached a field behind the copse across which our 
men regardless of orders were running and descending the valley that moment of moral hesitation 
which decides the fate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend 
to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding him continue their flight despite 
his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers despite his furious 
purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing of 
his saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into the air and disobeying 
orders the moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a 
panic the general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of 
the powder smoke and stopped in despair everything seemed lost but at that moment the 
french who were attacking suddenly and without any apparent reason ran back and disappeared from 
the outskirts and russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was company which alone 
had maintained its order in the wood and having lain in ambush in a ditch 
now attacked the french unexpectedly timókhin armed only with a sword had rushed at the 
enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad drunken determination that taken by surprise 
the french had thrown down their muskets and run dólokhov running beside timókhin killed a 
frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering french officer by 
his collar our fugitives returned the battalions re formed and the french who had nearly 
cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed our reserve units were 
able to join up and the fight was at an end the regimental commander and 
major ekonómov had stopped beside a bridge letting the retreating companies pass by them when 
a soldier came up and took hold of the stirrup almost leaning against him the 
man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth he had no knapsack or cap his 
head was bandaged and over his shoulder a french munition pouch was slung he had 
an sword in his hand the soldier was pale his blue eyes looked impudently into 
the face and his lips were smiling though the commander was occupied in giving instructions 
to major ekonómov he could not help taking notice of the soldier excellency here are 
two trophies said dólokhov pointing to the french sword and pouch have taken an officer 
prisoner i stopped the company dólokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences 
whole company can bear witness i beg you will remember this your excellency right all 
right replied the commander and turned to major ekonómov but dólokhov did not go away 
he untied the handkerchief around his head pulled it off and showed the blood congealed 
on his hair bayonet wound i remained at the front remember your excellency battery had 
been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did prince bagratión still 
hearing the cannonade in the center send his orderly staff officer and later prince andrew 
also to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible when the supports attached 
to battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by order the 
battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the french because the enemy 
could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite 
undefended guns on the contrary the energetic action of that battery led the french to 
suppose that the main russian forces were concentrated twice they had attempted to attack this 
point but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated 
guns on the hillock soon after prince bagratión had left him túshin had succeeded in 
setting fire to schön grabern at them scurrying burning just see the smoke fine grand 
look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen brightening up all the guns without 
waiting for orders were being fired in the direction of the conflagration as if urging 
each other on the soldiers cried at each shot good look at it grand the 
fire fanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french columns that had advanced beyond 
the village went back but as though in revenge for this failure the enemy placed 
ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at battery in 
their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the french 
our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls and then four more fell among 
our guns one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition wagon leg 
their spirits once roused were however not diminished but only changed character the horses were 
replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage the wounded were carried away and the 
four guns were turned against the ten gun battery companion officer had been killed at 
the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of 
the crews had been disabled but the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as 
ever twice they noticed the french appearing below them and then they fired grapeshot at 
them little túshin moving feebly and awkwardly kept telling his orderly to my pipe for 
that one and then scattering sparks from it ran forward shading his eyes with his 
small hand to look at the french at lads he kept saying seizing the guns 
by the wheels and working the screws himself amid the smoke deafened by the incessant 
reports which always made him jump túshin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran 
from gun to gun now aiming now counting the charges now giving orders about replacing 
dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones and shouting in his feeble voice so 
high pitched and irresolute his face grew more and more animated only when a man 
was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight shouting angrily 
at the men who as is always the case hesitated about lifting the injured or 
dead the soldiers for the most part handsome fellows and as is always the case 
in an artillery company a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their 
looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation and the expression on his 
face was invariably reflected on theirs owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for 
concentration and activity túshin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear and the 
thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to him on the 
contrary he became more and more elated it seemed to him that it was a 
very long time ago almost a day since he had first seen the enemy and 
fired the first shot and that the corner of the field he stood on was 
well known and familiar ground though he thought of everything considered everything and did everything 
the best of officers could do in his position he was in a state akin 
to feverish delirium or drunkenness from the deafening sounds of his own guns around him 
the whistle and thud of the cannon balls from the flushed and perspiring faces of 
the crew bustling round the guns from the sight of the blood of men and 
horses from the little puffs of smoke on the side always followed by a ball 
flying past and striking the earth a man a gun a horse from the sight 
of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his 
brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure the guns were in his fancy not 
guns but pipes from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker puffing again 
muttered túshin to himself as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne 
in a streak to the left by the wind look out for the ball throw 
it back do you want your honor asked an artilleryman standing close by who heard 
him muttering only a shell he answered along our matvévna he said to himself was 
the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery which was large 
and of an old pattern the french swarming round their guns seemed to him like 
ants in that world the handsome drunkard number one of the second crew was túshin 
looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every 
movement the sound of musketry at the foot of the hill now diminishing now increasing 
seemed like breathing he listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds daughter 
of matthew breathing again breathing he muttered to himself he imagined himself as an enormously 
tall powerful man who was throwing cannon balls at the french with both hands then 
matvévna dear old lady let me down he was saying as he moved from the 
gun when a strange unfamiliar voice called above his head túshin captain túshin turned round 
in dismay it was the staff officer who had turned him out of the booth 
at grunth he was shouting in a gasping voice you mad you have twice been 
ordered to retreat and you are they down on me thought túshin looking in alarm 
at his superior he muttered holding up two fingers to his cap but the staff 
officer did not finish what he wanted to say a cannon ball flying close to 
him caused him to duck and bend over his horse he paused and just as 
he was about to say something more another ball stopped him he turned his horse 
and galloped off all to retire he shouted from a distance the soldiers laughed a 
moment later an adjutant arrived with the same order it was prince andrew the first 
thing he saw on riding up to the space where guns were stationed was an 
unharnessed horse with a broken leg that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses blood 
was gushing from its leg as from a spring among the limbers lay several dead 
men one ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous 
shudder run down his spine but the mere thought of being afraid roused him again 
cannot be afraid thought he and dismounted slowly among the guns he delivered the order 
and did not leave the battery he decided to have the guns removed from their 
positions and withdrawn in his presence together with túshin stepping across the bodies and under 
a terrible fire from the french he attended to the removal of the guns staff 
officer was here a minute ago but skipped off said an artilleryman to prince andrew 
like your honor prince andrew said nothing to túshin they were both so busy as 
to seem not to notice one another when having limbered up the only two cannon 
that remained uninjured out of the four they began moving down the hill one shattered 
gun and one unicorn were left behind prince andrew rode up to túshin till we 
meet again he said holding out his hand to túshin by my dear fellow said 
túshin soul good by my dear fellow and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled 
his eyes chapter xxi the wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder 
smoke hung low over the field of battle on the horizon it was growing dark 
and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous the cannonade was dying down 
but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer as 
soon as túshin with his guns continually driving round or coming upon wounded men was 
out of range of fire and had descended into the dip he was met by 
some of the staff among them the staff officer and zherkóv who had been twice 
sent to battery but had never reached it interrupting one another they all gave and 
transmitted orders as to how to proceed reprimanding and reproaching him túshin gave no orders 
and to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing behind 
on his artillery nag though the orders were to abandon the wounded many of them 
dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages the jaunty infantry 
officer who just before the battle had rushed out of wattle shed was laid with 
a bullet in his stomach on carriage at the foot of the hill a pale 
hussar cadet supporting one hand with the other came up to túshin and asked for 
a seat for sake hurt my arm he said timidly sake i walk for sake 
it was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and been 
refused he asked in a hesitating piteous voice them to give me a seat for 
sake him a seat said túshin a cloak for him to sit on lad he 
said addressing his favorite soldier where is the wounded officer has been set down he 
died replied someone him up sit down dear fellow sit down spread out the cloak 
antónov the cadet was rostóv with one hand he supported the other he was pale 
and his jaw trembled shivering feverishly he was placed on the gun from which they 
had removed the dead officer the cloak they spread under him was wet with blood 
which stained his breeches and arm are you wounded my lad said túshin approaching the 
gun on which rostóv sat a sprain what is this blood on the gun carriage 
inquired túshin was the officer your honor stained it answered the artilleryman wiping away the 
blood with his coat sleeve as if apologizing for the state of his gun it 
was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by 
the infantry and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they halted it had grown so 
dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off and the firing had 
begun to subside suddenly near by on the right shouting and firing were again heard 
flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness this was the last french attack and was 
met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses they all rushed out of 
the village again but guns could not move and the artillerymen túshin and the cadet 
exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate the firing died down and soldiers talking 
eagerly streamed out of a side street hurt petróv asked one given it hot mate 
they make another push now said another see a thing how they shot at their 
own fellows nothing could be seen pitch dark brother there something to drink the french 
had been repulsed for the last time and again and again in the complete darkness 
guns moved forward surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame in the darkness 
it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in one direction humming 
with whispers and talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels amid the general rumble 
the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound 
in the darkness of the night the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with 
their groans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night after 
a while the moving mass became agitated someone rode past on a white horse followed 
by his suite and said something in passing did he say where to now halt 
is it did he thank us came eager questions from all sides the whole moving 
mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt 
evidently those in front had halted all remained where they were in the middle of 
the muddy road fires were lighted and the talk became more audible captain túshin having 
given orders to his company sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a 
doctor for the cadet and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on 
the road rostóv too dragged himself to the fire from pain cold and damp a 
feverish shivering shook his whole body drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awake 
by an excruciating pain in his arm for which he could find no satisfactory position 
he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire which seemed to 
him dazzlingly red and at the feeble round shouldered figure of túshin who was sitting 
cross legged like a turk beside him large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy 
and commiseration on rostóv who saw that túshin with his whole heart wished to help 
him but could not from all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the 
infantry who were walking driving past and settling down all around the sound of voices 
the tramping feet the hoofs moving in mud the crackling of wood fires near and 
afar merged into one tremulous rumble it was no longer as before a dark unseen 
river flowing through the gloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a 
storm rostóv looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him an 
infantryman came to the fire squatted on his heels held his hands to the blaze 
and turned away his face mind your honor he asked túshin lost my company your 
honor i know where such bad luck with the soldier an infantry officer with a 
bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire and addressing túshin asked him to have the 
guns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past after he had gone two 
soldiers rushed to the campfire they were quarreling and fighting desperately each trying to snatch 
from the other a boot they were both holding on to picked it up i 
dare say very smart one of them shouted hoarsely then a thin pale soldier his 
neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band came up and in angry tones asked the 
artillerymen for water one die like a dog said he túshin told them to give 
the man some water then a cheerful soldier ran up begging a little fire for 
the infantry nice little hot torch for the infantry good luck to you fellow countrymen 
thanks for the return it with interest said he carrying away into the darkness a 
glowing stick next came four soldiers carrying something heavy on a cloak and passed by 
the fire one of them stumbled the devil has put the logs on the road 
snarled he carry him said another up and they disappeared into the darkness with their 
load aching túshin asked rostóv in a whisper honor wanted by the general he is 
in the hut here said a gunner coming up to túshin friend túshin rose and 
buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight walked away from the fire not far from 
the artillery campfire in a hut that had been prepared for him prince bagratión sat 
at dinner talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters the little 
old man with the half closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone and 
the general who had served blamelessly for twenty two years flushed by a glass of 
vodka and the dinner and the staff officer with the signet ring and zherkóv uneasily 
glancing at them all and prince andrew pale with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes 
in a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the french and the 
accountant with the naïve face was feeling its texture shaking his head in because the 
banner really interested him perhaps because it was hard for him hungry as he was 
to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him in the 
next hut there was a french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons 
our officers were flocking in to look at him prince bagratión was thanking the individual 
commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses the general whose regiment 
had been inspected at braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action 
began he had withdrawn from the wood mustered the men who were woodcutting and allowing 
the french to pass him had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had 
broken up the french troops i saw your excellency that their first battalion was disorganized 
i stopped in the road and thought let them come on and will meet them 
with the fire of the whole what i did the general had so wished to 
do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it 
seemed to him as if it had really happened perhaps it might really have been 
so could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not 
happen the way your excellency i should inform you he conversation with kutúzov and his 
last interview with the gentleman private dólokhov who was reduced to the ranks took a 
french officer prisoner in my presence and particularly distinguished himself saw the pávlograd hussars attack 
there your excellency chimed in zherkóv looking uneasily around he had not seen the hussars 
all that day but had heard about them from an infantry officer broke up two 
squares your excellency several of those present smiled at words expecting one of his usual 
jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of our arms 
and of the work they assumed a serious expression though many of them knew that 
what he was saying was a lie devoid of any foundation prince bagratión turned to 
the old colonel i thank you all all arms have behaved heroically infantry cavalry and 
artillery how was it that two guns were abandoned in the center he inquired searching 
with his eyes for someone prince bagratión did not ask about the guns on the 
left flank he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very 
beginning of the action think i sent you he added turning to the staff officer 
on duty was damaged answered the staff officer the other i understand i was there 
all the time giving orders and had only just left it is true that it 
was hot there he added modestly someone mentioned that captain túshin was bivouacking close to 
the village and had already been sent for but you were there said prince bagratión 
addressing prince andrew course we only just missed one another said the staff officer with 
a smile to bolkónski had not the pleasure of seeing you said prince andrew coldly 
and abruptly all were silent túshin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly 
from behind the backs of the generals as he stepped past the generals in the 
crowded hut feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors he 
did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it several of those 
present laughed was it a gun was abandoned asked bagratión frowning not so much at 
the captain as at those who were laughing among whom zherkóv laughed loudest only now 
when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guilt and the disgrace of 
having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to túshin in all their 
horror he had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that 
moment the laughter confused him still more he stood before bagratión with his lower jaw 
trembling and was hardly able to mutter know your excellency i had no men your 
excellency might have taken some from the covering troops túshin did not say that there 
were no covering troops though that was perfectly true he was afraid of getting some 
other officer into trouble and silently fixed his eyes on bagratión as a schoolboy who 
has blundered looks at an examiner the silence lasted some time prince bagratión apparently not 
wishing to be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture to intervene 
prince andrew looked at túshin from under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously excellency 
prince andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice were pleased to send me to 
captain battery i went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked 
out two guns smashed and no supports at all prince bagratión and túshin looked with 
equal intentness at bolkónski who spoke with suppressed agitation if your excellency will allow me 
to express my opinion he continued owe success chiefly to the action of that battery 
and the heroic endurance of captain túshin and his company and without awaiting a reply 
prince andrew rose and left the table prince bagratión looked at túshin evidently reluctant to 
show distrust in emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it bent his 
head and told túshin that he could go prince andrew went out with him you 
you saved me my dear fellow said túshin prince andrew gave him a look but 
said nothing and went away he felt sad and depressed it was all so strange 
so unlike what he had hoped are they why are they here what do they 
want and when will all this end thought rostóv looking at the changing shadows before 
him the pain in his arm became more and more intense irresistible drowsiness overpowered him 
red rings danced before his eyes and the impression of those voices and faces and 
a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain it was they these and was 
they who were crushing weighing down and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of 
his sprained arm and shoulder to rid himself of them he closed his eyes for 
a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in 
a dream his mother and her large white hand thin little shoulders eyes and laughter 
denísov with his voice and mustache and telyánin and all that affair with telyánin and 
bogdánich that affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice and 
it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly incessantly pulling and pressing 
his arm and always dragging it in one direction he tried to get away from 
them but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a breadth it 
would not would be only they did not pull it but it was impossible to 
get rid of them he opened his eyes and looked up the black canopy of 
night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling 
snow were fluttering in that light túshin had not returned the doctor had not come 
he was alone now except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other 
side of the fire warming his thin yellow body wants me thought rostóv is no 
one to help me or pity me yet i was once at home strong happy 
and loved he sighed and doing so groaned involuntarily is anything hurting you asked the 
soldier shaking his shirt out over the fire and not waiting for an answer he 
gave a grunt and added a lot of men have been crippled rostóv did not 
listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and remembered 
a russian winter at his warm bright home his fluffy fur coat his quickly gliding 
sleigh his healthy body and all the affection and care of his family why did 
i come here he wondered next day the french army did not renew their attack 
and the remnant of detachment was reunited to army book three 1805 chapter i prince 
vasíli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans still less did he 
think of injuring anyone for his own advantage he was merely a man of the 
world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a habit schemes 
and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself but which formed the whole 
interest of his life were constantly shaping themselves in his mind arising from the circumstances 
and persons he met of these plans he had not merely one or two in 
his head but dozens some only beginning to form themselves some approaching achievement and some 
in course of disintegration he did not for instance say to himself man now has 
influence i must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special grant 
nor did he say to himself is a rich man i must entice him to 
marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles i need but when he 
came across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man could 
be useful and without any premeditation prince vasíli took the first opportunity to gain his 
confidence flatter him become intimate with him and finally make his request he had pierre 
at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment as gentleman of the bedchamber 
which at that time conferred the status of councilor of state and insisted on the 
young man accompanying him to petersburg and staying at his house with apparent absent mindedness 
yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing prince vasíli did everything 
to get pierre to marry his daughter had he thought out his plans beforehand he 
could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody 
both above and below him in social standing something always drew him toward those richer 
and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune 
moment for making use of people pierre on unexpectedly becoming count bezúkhov and a rich 
man felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and preoccupied 
that only in bed was he able to be by himself he had to sign 
papers to present himself at government offices the purpose of which was not clear to 
him to question his chief steward to visit his estate near moscow and to receive 
many people who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would 
now have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them these different 
relations and acquaintances all disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and 
flattering manner they were all evidently firmly convinced of noble qualities he was always hearing 
such words as your remarkable kindness or your excellent heart are yourself so honorable count 
or he as clever as you and so on till he began sincerely to believe 
in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence the more so as in the depth 
of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really was very kind 
and intelligent even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now 
became gentle and affectionate the angry eldest princess with the long waist and hair plastered 
down like a had come into room after the funeral with drooping eyes and frequent 
blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not 
now feel she had a right to ask him for anything except only for permission 
after the blow she had received to remain for a few weeks longer in the 
house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much she could not refrain 
from weeping at these words touched that this statuesque princess could so change pierre took 
her hand and begged her forgiveness without knowing what for from that day the eldest 
princess quite changed toward pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him this for 
my sake mon cher after all she had to put up with a great deal 
from the deceased said prince vasíli to him handing him a deed to sign for 
the benefit prince vasíli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw 
this bill for thirty thousand the poor princess that it might not occur to her 
to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio pierre signed the 
deed and after that the princess grew still kinder the younger sisters also became affectionate 
to him especially the youngest the pretty one with the mole who often made him 
feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him it seemed so 
natural to pierre that everyone should like him and it would have seemed so unnatural 
had anyone disliked him that he could not but believe in the sincerity of those 
around him besides he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere 
or not he was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and 
cheerful intoxication he felt as though he were the center of some important and general 
movement that something was constantly expected of him that if he did not do it 
he would grieve and disappoint many people but if he did this and that all 
would be well and he did what was demanded of him but still that happy 
result always remained in the future more than anyone else prince vasíli took possession of 
affairs and of pierre himself in those early days from the death of count bezúkhov 
he did not let go his hold of the lad he had the air of 
a man oppressed by business weary and suffering who yet would not for sake leave 
this helpless youth who after all was the son of his old friend and the 
possessor of such enormous wealth to the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues 
during the few days he spent in moscow after the death of count bezúkhov he 
would call pierre or go to him himself and tell him what ought to be 
done in a tone of weariness and assurance as if he were adding every time 
know i am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that i 
trouble myself about you and you also know quite well that what i propose is 
the only thing possible my dear fellow tomorrow we are off at last said prince 
vasíli one day closing his eyes and fingering elbow speaking as if he were saying 
something which had long since been agreed upon and could not now be altered start 
tomorrow and giving you a place in my carriage i am very glad all our 
important business here is now settled and i ought to have been off long ago 
here is something i have received from the chancellor i asked him for you and 
you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber 
the diplomatic career now lies open before you notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with 
which these words were pronounced pierre who had so long been considering his career wished 
to make some suggestion but prince vasíli interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone 
precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech which he used in extreme cases when special 
persuasion was needed mon cher i did this for my own sake to satisfy my 
conscience and there is nothing to thank me for no one has ever complained yet 
of being too much loved and besides you are free you could throw it up 
tomorrow but you will see everything for yourself when you get to petersburg it is 
high time for you to get away from these terrible recollections prince vasíli sighed yes 
my boy and my valet can go in your carriage ah i was nearly forgetting 
he added know mon cher your father and i had some accounts to settle so 
i have received what was due from the ryazán estate and will keep it you 
require it go into the accounts later by was due from the ryazán prince vasíli 
meant several thousand rubles quitrent received from peasants which the prince had retained for himself 
in petersburg as in moscow pierre found the same atmosphere of gentleness and affection he 
could not refuse the post or rather the rank for he did nothing that prince 
vasíli had procured for him and acquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerous that 
even more than in moscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustle and continual expectation 
of some good always in front of him but never attained of his former bachelor 
acquaintances many were no longer in petersburg the guards had gone to the front dólokhov 
had been reduced to the ranks anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces 
prince andrew was abroad so pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as 
he used to like to spend them or to open his mind by intimate talks 
with a friend older than himself and whom he respected his whole time was taken 
up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at prince house in the company 
of the stout princess his wife and his beautiful daughter hélène like the others anna 
pávlovna schérer showed pierre the change of attitude toward him that had taken place in 
society formerly in anna presence pierre had always felt that what he was saying was 
out of place tactless and unsuitable that remarks which seemed to him clever while they 
formed in his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them while on the 
contrary stupidest remarks came out clever and apt now everything pierre said was charmant even 
if anna pávlovna did not say so he could see that she wished to and 
only refrained out of regard for his modesty in the beginning of the winter of 
1805 6 pierre received one of anna usual pink notes with an invitation to which 
was added will find the beautiful hélène here whom it is always delightful to see 
when he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time that some link which 
other people recognized had grown up between himself and hélène and that thought both alarmed 
him as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill 
and pleased him as an entertaining supposition anna was like the former one only the 
novelty she offered her guests this time was not mortemart but a diplomatist fresh from 
berlin with the very latest details of the emperor visit to potsdam and of how 
the two august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause 
of justice against the enemy of the human race anna pávlovna received pierre with a 
shade of melancholy evidently relating to the young recent loss by the death of count 
bezúkhov everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure pierre that he was greatly afflicted 
by the death of the father he had hardly known and her melancholy was just 
like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august majesty the 
empress márya fëdorovna pierre felt flattered by this anna pávlovna arranged the different groups in 
her drawing room with her habitual skill the large group in which were prince vasíli 
and the generals had the benefit of the diplomat another group was at the tea 
table pierre wished to join the former but anna was in the excited condition of 
a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which 
there is hardly time to put in pierre touched his sleeve with her finger saying 
a bit i have something in view for you this evening she glanced at hélène 
and smiled at her dear hélène be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you 
go and keep her company for ten minutes and that it will not be too 
dull here is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany you the beauty 
went to the aunt but anna pávlovna detained pierre looking as if she had to 
give some final necessary instructions she exquisite she said to pierre pointing to the stately 
beauty as she glided away how she carries herself for so young a girl such 
tact such masterly perfection of manner it comes from her heart happy the man who 
wins her with her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position 
in society you think so i only wanted to know your opinion and anna pávlovna 
let pierre go pierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to perfection of manner 
if he ever thought of hélène it was just of her beauty and her remarkable 
skill in appearing silently dignified in society the old aunt received the two young people 
in her corner but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for hélène and inclined rather 
to show her fear of anna pávlovna she looked at her niece as if inquiring 
what she was to do with these people on leaving them anna pávlovna again touched 
sleeve saying hope you say that it is dull in my house again and she 
glanced at hélène hélène smiled with a look implying that she did not admit the 
possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted the aunt coughed swallowed and said in 
french that she was very pleased to see hélène then she turned to pierre with 
the same words of welcome and the same look in the middle of a dull 
and halting conversation hélène turned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave 
to everyone pierre was so used to that smile and it had so little meaning 
for him that he paid no attention to it the aunt was just speaking of 
a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to father count bezúkhov and showed them her 
own box princess hélène asked to see the portrait of the husband on the box 
lid is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioning a celebrated miniaturist and he 
leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being 
said at the other table he half rose meaning to go round but the aunt 
handed him the snuffbox passing it across back hélène stooped forward to make room and 
looked round with a smile she was as always at evening parties wearing a dress 
such as was then fashionable cut very low at front and back her bust which 
had always seemed like marble to pierre was so close to him that his shortsighted 
eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders so near 
to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have 
touched them he was conscious of the warmth of her body the scent of perfume 
and the creaking of her corset as she moved he did not see her marble 
beauty forming a complete whole with her dress but all the charm of her body 
only covered by her garments and having once seen this he could not help being 
aware of it just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through 
you have never noticed before how beautiful i am hélène seemed to say had not 
noticed that i am a woman yes i am a woman who may belong to 
you too said her glance and at that moment pierre felt that hélène not only 
could but must be his wife and that it could not be otherwise he knew 
this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar 
with her how and when this would be he did not know he did not 
even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not 
why that it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happen pierre 
dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to see her as a 
distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her every day until then 
but he could no longer do it he could not any more than a man 
who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking 
it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once 
recognized it to be a tuft of grass she was terribly close to him she 
already had power over him and between them there was no longer any barrier except 
the barrier of his own will i will leave you in your little corner came 
anna voice see you are all right there and pierre anxiously trying to remember whether 
he had done anything reprehensible looked round with a blush it seemed to him that 
everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself a little later 
when he went up to the large circle anna pávlovna said to him hear you 
are refitting your petersburg house this was true the architect had told him that it 
was necessary and pierre without knowing why was having his enormous petersburg house done up 
a good thing but move from prince it is good to have a friend like 
the prince she said smiling at prince vasíli know something about that i and you 
are still so young you need advice be angry with me for exercising an old 
privilege she paused as women always do expecting something after they have mentioned their age 
you marry it will be a different thing she continued uniting them both in one 
glance pierre did not look at hélène nor she at him but she was just 
as terribly close to him he muttered something and colored when he got home he 
could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what had happened what had 
happened nothing he had merely understood that the woman he had known as a child 
of whom when her beauty was mentioned he had said absent mindedly good looking he 
had understood that this woman might belong to him stupid i have myself said she 
is stupid he thought is something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites in 
me i have been told that her brother anatole was in love with her and 
she with him that there was quite a scandal and that why he was sent 
away hippolyte is her brother prince vasíli is her father bad he reflected but while 
he was thinking this the reflection was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and was 
conscious that another line of thought had sprung up and while thinking of her worthlessness 
he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife how she would love 
him become quite different and how all he had thought and heard of her might 
be false and he again saw her not as the daughter of prince vasíli but 
visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress no why did this thought 
never occur to me before and again he told himself that it was impossible that 
there would be something unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable in this marriage 
he recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks of those who 
had seen them together he recalled anna words and looks when she spoke to him 
about his house recalled thousands of such hints from prince vasíli and others and was 
seized by terror lest he had already in some way bound himself to do something 
that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do but at the very 
time he was expressing this conviction to himself in another part of his mind her 
image rose in all its womanly beauty chapter ii in november 1805 prince vasíli had 
to go on a tour of inspection in four different provinces he had arranged this 
for himself so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick 
up his son anatole where his regiment was stationed and take him to visit prince 
nicholas bolkónski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that 
rich old man but before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs prince vasíli had 
to settle matters with pierre who it is true had latterly spent whole days at 
home that is in prince house where he was staying and had been absurd excited 
and foolish in presence as a lover should be but had not yet proposed to 
her is all very fine but things must be settled said prince vasíli to himself 
with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that pierre who was under such obligations to 
him never mind was not behaving very well in this matter frivolity well god be 
with him thought he relishing his own goodness of heart it must be brought to 
a head the day after tomorrow will be name day i will invite two or 
three people and if he does not understand what he ought to do then it 
will be my my affair i am her father six weeks after anna and after 
the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry hélène would be a calamity 
and that he ought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decision had 
not left prince and felt with terror that in eyes he was every day more 
and more connected with her that it was impossible for him to return to his 
former conception of her that he could not break away from her and that though 
it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers 
he might perhaps have been able to free himself but that prince vasíli who had 
rarely before given receptions now hardly let a day go by without having an evening 
party at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general 
pleasure and disappoint expectation prince vasíli in the rare moments when he was at home 
would take hand in passing and draw it downwards or absent mindedly hold out his 
wrinkled clean shaven cheek for pierre to kiss and would say tomorrow or in to 
dinner or i shall not see you or am staying in for your sake and 
so on and though prince vasíli when he stayed in as he said for sake 
hardly exchanged a couple of words with him pierre felt unable to disappoint him every 
day he said to himself one and the same thing is time i understood her 
and made up my mind what she really is was i mistaken before or am 
i mistaken now no she is not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes 
said to himself never makes a mistake never says anything stupid she says little but 
what she does say is always clear and simple so she is not stupid she 
never was abashed and is not abashed now so she cannot be a bad woman 
he had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company and she 
had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate that it did not interest 
by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed pierre her 
superiority she was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile 
she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone in which 
there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened her face 
pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a 
certain line and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it but 
an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step a thousand times 
during that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to 
that dreadful abyss pierre said to himself am i doing i need resolution can it 
be that i have none he wished to take a decision but felt with dismay 
that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in 
himself and really possessed pierre was one of those who are only strong when they 
feel themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling 
of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at anna an unacknowledged sense of the guilt 
of that desire paralyzed his will on name day a small party of just their 
own his wife for supper at prince all these friends and relations had been given 
to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening the 
visitors were seated at supper princess kurágina a portly imposing woman who had once been 
handsome was sitting at the head of the table on either side of her sat 
the more important old general and his wife and anna pávlovna schérer at the other 
end sat the younger and less important guests and there too sat the members of 
the family and pierre and hélène side by side prince vasíli was not having any 
supper he went round the table in a merry mood sitting down now by one 
now by another of the guests to each of them he made some careless and 
agreeable remark except to pierre and hélène whose presence he seemed not to notice he 
enlivened the whole party the wax candles burned brightly the silver and crystal gleamed so 
did the toilets and the gold and silver of the epaulets servants in scarlet liveries 
moved round the table the clatter of plates knives and glasses mingled with the animated 
hum of several conversations at one end of the table the old chamberlain was heard 
assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately at which she laughed at the 
other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some mary víktorovna or other 
at the center of the table prince vasíli attracted attention with a facetious smile on 
his face he was telling the ladies about last meeting of the imperial council at 
which sergéy kuzmích vyazmítinov the new military governor general of petersburg had received and read 
the then famous rescript of the emperor alexander from the army to sergéy kuzmích in 
which the emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the loyalty 
that the declaration from petersburg gave him particular pleasure and that he was proud to 
be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be worthy of 
it this rescript began with the words kuzmích from all sides reports reach me etc 
and so he never got farther than asked one of the ladies not a breadth 
farther answered prince vasíli laughing kuzmích from all sides from all sides sergéy kuzmích poor 
vyazmítinov could not get any farther he began the rescript again and again but as 
soon as he uttered he sobbed mí ch tears and all was smothered in sobs 
and he could get no farther and again his handkerchief and again kuzmích from all 
sides and tears till at last somebody else was asked to read it from all 
sides and then tears someone repeated laughing be unkind cried anna pávlovna from her end 
of the table holding up a threatening finger is such a worthy and excellent man 
our dear vyazmítinov everybody laughed a great deal at the head of the table where 
the honored guests sat everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence 
of a variety of exciting sensations only pierre and hélène sat silently side by side 
almost at the bottom of the table a suppressed smile brightening both their faces a 
smile that had nothing to do with sergéy smile of bashfulness at their own feelings 
but much as all the rest laughed talked and joked much as they enjoyed their 
rhine wine sauté and ices and however they avoided looking at the young couple and 
heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them one could feel by the occasional glances 
they gave that the story about sergéy kuzmích the laughter and the food were all 
a pretense and that the whole attention of that company was directed and hélène prince 
vasíli mimicked the sobbing of sergéy kuzmích and at the same time his eyes glanced 
toward his daughter and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said getting 
on it will all be settled today anna pávlovna threatened him on behalf of dear 
vyazmítinov and in her eyes which for an instant glanced at pierre prince vasíli read 
a congratulation on his future son in law and on his happiness the old princess 
sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and 
glanced angrily at her daughter and her sigh seemed to say nothing left for you 
and me but to sip sweet wine my dear now that the time has come 
for these young ones to be thus boldly provocatively happy what nonsense all this is 
that i am saying thought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces of the lovers 
happiness into the insignificant trifling and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple 
feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one 
another and this human feeling dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter 
jests fell flat news was not interesting and the animation was evidently forced not only 
the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this and they 
forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful hélène with her radiant face and 
at the red broad and happy though uneasy face of pierre it seemed as if 
the very light of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone pierre 
felt that he was the center of it all and this both pleased and embarrassed 
him he was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation he did not see 
hear or understand anything clearly only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the 
world of reality shot unexpectedly through his mind it is all finished he thought how 
has it all happened how quickly now i know that not because of her alone 
nor of myself alone but because of everyone it must inevitably come about they are 
all expecting it they are so sure that it will happen that i cannot i 
cannot disappoint them but how will it be i do not know but it will 
certainly happen thought pierre glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes or he 
would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what he felt it awkward to attract 
attention and to be considered a lucky man and with his plain face to be 
looked on as a sort of paris possessed of a helen no doubt it always 
is and must be so he consoled himself besides what have i done to bring 
it about how did it begin i traveled from moscow with prince vasíli then there 
was nothing so why should i not stay at his house then i played cards 
with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her how did it 
begin when did it all come about and here he was sitting by her side 
as her betrothed seeing hearing feeling her nearness her breathing her movements her beauty then 
it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so 
unusually beautiful and that that was why they all looked so at him and flattered 
by this general admiration he would expand his chest raise his head and rejoice at 
his good fortune suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second 
time but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said am 
asking you when you last heard from bolkónski repeated prince vasíli a third time absent 
minded you are my dear fellow prince vasíli smiled and pierre noticed that everyone was 
smiling at him and hélène what of it if you all know it thought pierre 
of it the truth and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile and hélène smiled 
too did you get the letter was it from olmütz repeated prince vasíli who pretended 
to want to know this in order to settle a dispute can one talk or 
think of such trifles thought pierre from olmütz he answered with a sigh after supper 
pierre with his partner followed the others into the drawing room the guests began to 
disperse some without taking leave of hélène some as if unwilling to distract her from 
an important occupation came up to her for a moment and made haste to go 
away refusing to let her see them off the diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as 
he left the drawing room he pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison 
with happiness the old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg 
was the old fool he thought princess hélène will be beautiful still when fifty think 
i may congratulate you whispered anna pávlovna to the old princess kissing her soundly i 
this headache have stayed longer the old princess did not reply she was tormented by 
jealousy of her happiness while the guests were taking their leave pierre remained for a 
long time alone with hélène in the little drawing room where they were sitting he 
had often before during the last six weeks remained alone with her but had never 
spoken to her of love now he felt that it was inevitable but he could 
not make up his mind to take the final step he felt ashamed he felt 
that he was occupying someone place here beside hélène happiness is not for you some 
inner voice whispered to him happiness is for those who have not in them what 
there is in you but as he had to say something he began by asking 
her whether she was satisfied with the party she replied in her usual simple manner 
that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever 
had some of the nearest relatives had not yet left they were sitting in the 
large drawing room prince vasíli came up to pierre with languid footsteps pierre rose and 
said it was getting late prince vasíli gave him a look of stern inquiry as 
though what pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it 
in but then the expression of severity changed and he drew hand downwards made him 
sit down and smiled affectionately lëlya he asked turning instantly to his daughter and addressing 
her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their 
children from babyhood but which prince vasíli had only acquired by imitating other parents and 
he again turned to pierre all he said unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat 
pierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about 
sergéy kuzmích that interested prince vasíli just then and prince vasíli saw that pierre knew 
this he suddenly muttered something and went away it seemed to pierre that even the 
prince was disconcerted the sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world 
touched pierre he looked at hélène and she too seemed disconcerted and her look seemed 
to say it is your own fault step must be taken but i cannot i 
cannot thought pierre and he again began speaking about indifferent matters about sergéy kuzmích asking 
what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly hélène 
answered with a smile that she too had missed it when prince vasíli returned to 
the drawing room the princess his wife was talking in low tones to the elderly 
lady about pierre course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dear are 
made in heaven replied the elderly lady prince vasíli passed by seeming not to hear 
the ladies and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room 
he closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing his head sank forward and then 
he roused himself he said to his wife and see what they are about the 
princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air 
and glanced into the little drawing room pierre and hélène still sat talking just as 
before the same she said to her husband prince vasíli frowned twisting his mouth his 
cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him shaking himself 
he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps went past the ladies into 
the little drawing room with quick steps he went joyfully up to pierre his face 
was so unusually triumphant that pierre rose in alarm on seeing it god said prince 
vasíli wife has told me everything he put one arm around pierre and the other 
around his daughter dear boy lëlya i am very pleased his voice trembled loved your 
father and she will make you a good wife god bless you he embraced his 
daughter and then again pierre and kissed him with his malodorous mouth tears actually moistened 
his cheeks come here he shouted the old princess came in and also wept the 
elderly lady was using her handkerchief too pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautiful 
hand several times after a while they were left alone again this had to be 
and could not be otherwise thought pierre it is useless to ask whether it is 
good or bad it is good because definite and one is rid of the old 
tormenting doubt pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful 
bosom as it rose and fell he said aloud and paused special is always said 
in such cases he thought but could not remember what it was that people say 
he looked at her face she drew nearer to him her face flushed take those 
off those she said pointing to his spectacles pierre took them off and his eyes 
besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed had also 
a frightened and inquiring look he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss 
it but with a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted his lips 
and met them with her own her face struck pierre by its altered unpleasantly excited 
expression is too late now done besides i love her thought pierre vous aime he 
said remembering what has to be said at such moments but his words sounded so 
weak that he felt ashamed of himself love you six weeks later he was married 
and settled in count large newly furnished petersburg house the happy possessor as people said 
of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money chapter iii 
old prince nicholas bolkónski received a letter from prince vasíli in november 1805 announcing that 
he and his son would be paying him a visit am starting on a journey 
of inspection and of course i shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to 
come and see you at the same time my honored benefactor wrote prince vasíli son 
anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army so i hope you will 
allow him personally to express the deep respect that emulating his father he feels for 
you seems that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors are coming 
to us of their own accord incautiously remarked the little princess on hearing the news 
prince nicholas frowned but said nothing a fortnight after the letter prince servants came one 
evening in advance of him and he and his son arrived next day old bolkónski 
had always had a poor opinion of prince character but more so recently since in 
the new reigns of paul and alexander prince vasíli had risen to high position and 
honors and now from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little 
princess he saw which way the wind was blowing and his low opinion changed into 
a feeling of contemptuous ill will he snorted whenever he mentioned him on the day 
of prince arrival prince bolkónski was particularly discontented and out of temper whether he was 
in a bad temper because prince vasíli was coming or whether his being in a 
bad temper made him specially annoyed at prince visit he was in a bad temper 
and in the morning tíkhon had already advised the architect not to go to the 
prince with his report you hear how walking said tíkhon drawing the attention to the 
sound of the footsteps flat on his know what that means however at nine the 
prince in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap went out for his 
usual walk it had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse along 
which the prince was in the habit of walking had been swept the marks of 
the broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking 
in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path the prince 
went through the conservatories the quarters and the outbuildings frowning and silent a sleigh pass 
he asked his overseer a venerable man resembling his master in manners and looks who 
was accompanying him back to the house snow is deep i am having the avenue 
swept your honor the prince bowed his head and went up to the porch be 
thanked thought the overseer storm has blown over would have been hard to drive up 
your honor he added heard your honor that a minister is coming to visit your 
honor the prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him frowning 
a minister what minister who gave orders he said in his shrill harsh voice road 
is not swept for the princess my daughter but for a minister for me there 
are no ministers honor i thought thought shouted the prince his words coming more and 
more rapidly and indistinctly thought rascals blackguards teach you to think and lifting his stick 
he swung it and would have hit alpátych the overseer had not the latter instinctively 
avoided the blow blackguards shouted the prince rapidly but although alpátych frightened at his own 
temerity in avoiding the stroke came up to the prince bowing his bald head resignedly 
before him or perhaps for that very reason the prince though he continued to shout 
throw the snow back on the road did not lift his stick again but hurried 
into the house before dinner princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne who knew that the prince 
was in a bad humor stood awaiting him mademoiselle bourienne with a radiant face that 
said know nothing i am the same as usual and princess mary pale frightened and 
with downcast eyes what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such 
occasions she ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne but could not she thought i seem 
not to notice he will think that i do not sympathize with him if i 
seem sad and out of spirits myself he will say as he has done before 
that in the dumps the prince looked at his frightened face and snorted or dummy 
he muttered the other one is not here been telling tales he to the little 
princess who was not in the dining room is the princess he asked is not 
very well answered mademoiselle bourienne with a bright smile she come down it is natural 
in her state hm muttered the prince sitting down his plate seemed to him not 
quite clean and pointing to a spot he flung it away tíkhon caught it and 
handed it to a footman the little princess was not unwell but had such an 
overpowering fear of the prince that hearing he was in a bad humor she had 
decided not to appear am afraid for the baby she said to mademoiselle bourienne knows 
what a fright might do in general at bald hills the little princess lived in 
constant fear and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did 
not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling the prince reciprocated this 
antipathy but it was overpowered by his contempt for her when the little princess had 
grown accustomed to life at bald hills she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne 
spent whole days with her asked her to sleep in her room and often talked 
with her about the old prince and criticized him we are to have visitors mon 
prince remarked mademoiselle bourienne unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers excellency prince vasíli 
kurágin and his son i understand she said inquiringly excellency is a puppy i got 
him his appointment in the service said the prince disdainfully his son is coming i 
understand perhaps princess elizabeth and princess mary know i want him he looked at his 
blushing daughter you unwell today eh afraid of the as that idiot alpátych called him 
this morning mon père though mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of 
a subject she did not stop talking but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty 
of a flower that had just opened and after the soup the prince became more 
genial after dinner he went to see his daughter in law the little princess was 
sitting at a small table chattering with másha her maid she grew pale on seeing 
her father in law she was much altered she was now plain rather than pretty 
her cheeks had sunk her lip was drawn up and her eyes drawn down i 
feel a kind of oppression she said in reply to the question as to how 
she felt you want anything merci mon père all right all right he left the 
room and went to the waiting room where alpátych stood with bowed head the snow 
been shoveled back your excellency forgive me for sake it was only my stupidity right 
all right interrupted the prince and laughing his unnatural way he stretched out his hand 
for alpátych to kiss and then proceeded to his study prince vasíli arrived that evening 
he was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen who with loud shouts dragged 
his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow 
prince vasíli and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them anatole having taken off his 
overcoat sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly 
and absent mindedly fixed his large and handsome eyes he regarded his whole life as 
a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him 
and he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and 
ugly heiress in the same way all this might he thought turn out very well 
and amusingly why not marry her if she really has so much money that never 
does any harm thought anatole he shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance 
which had become habitual to him and his handsome head held high entered his room 
with the good humored and victorious air natural to him prince two valets were busy 
dressing him and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son 
as the latter entered as if to say how i want you to look say 
father joking apart is she very hideous anatole asked as if continuing a conversation the 
subject of which had often been mentioned during the journey what nonsense above all try 
to be respectful and cautious with the old prince he starts a row go away 
said prince anatole bear those old men eh for you everything depends on this in 
the meantime not only was it known in the rooms that the minister and his 
son had arrived but the appearance of both had been minutely described princess mary was 
sitting alone in her room vainly trying to master her agitation did they write why 
did lise tell me about it it can never happen she said looking at herself 
in the glass shall i enter the drawing room even if i like him i 
now be myself with him the mere thought of her look filled her with terror 
the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received from másha the maid the necessary 
report of how handsome the son was with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and 
with what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed 
him like an eagle three steps at a time having received this information the little 
princess and mademoiselle bourienne whose chattering voices had reached her from the corridor went into 
princess room know come marie said the little princess waddling in and sinking heavily into 
an armchair she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the 
morning but had on one of her best dresses her hair was carefully done and 
her face was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines dressed 
as she used to be in petersburg society it was still more noticeable how much 
plainer she had become some unobtrusive touch had been added to mademoiselle toilet which rendered 
her fresh and pretty face yet more attractive are you going to remain as you 
are dear princess she began be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room 
and we shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself up at 
all the little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrily began 
to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should be dressed princess 
self esteem was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her 
and still more so by both her not having the least conception that it could 
be otherwise to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would 
be to betray her agitation while to decline their offers to dress her would prolong 
their banter and insistence she flushed her beautiful eyes grew dim red blotches came on 
her face and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore as 
she submitted herself to mademoiselle bourienne and lise both these women quite sincerely tried to 
make her look pretty she was so plain that neither of them could think of 
her as a rival so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity and with the 
naïve and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty really my 
dear this dress is not pretty said lise looking sideways at princess mary from a 
little distance have a maroon dress have it fetched really you know the fate of 
your whole life may be at stake but this one is too light not becoming 
it was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess mary that 
was not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little princess felt this they still 
thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair the hair combed up 
and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress and so on all 
would be well they forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be 
altered and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face it 
would still remain piteous and plain after two or three changes to which princess mary 
meekly submitted just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head 
a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks and she had put on a 
maroon dress with a pale blue scarf the little princess walked twice round her now 
adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and 
looking at her with her head bent first on one side and then on the 
other it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands mary really this dress 
does not suit you i prefer you in your little gray everyday dress now please 
do it for my sake katie she said to the maid the princess her gray 
dress and see mademoiselle bourienne how i shall arrange it she added smiling with a 
foretaste of artistic pleasure but when katie brought the required dress princess mary remained sitting 
motionless before the glass looking at her face and saw in the mirror her eyes 
full of tears and her mouth quivering ready to burst into sobs dear princess said 
mademoiselle bourienne one more little effort the little princess taking the dress from the maid 
came up to princess mary now arrange something quite simple and becoming she said the 
three voices hers mademoiselle and who was laughing at something mingled in a merry sound 
like the chirping of birds leave me alone said princess mary her voice sounded so 
serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was silenced at once they 
looked at the beautiful large thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing shiningly 
and imploringly at them and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist 
least change your coiffure said the little princess i tell you she went on turning 
reproachfully to mademoiselle bourienne is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in 
the least not in the least please change it me alone please leave me alone 
it is all quite the same to me answered a voice struggling with tears mademoiselle 
bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves that princess mary in this 
guise looked very plain worse than usual but it was too late she was looking 
at them with an expression they both knew an expression thoughtful and sad this expression 
in princess mary did not frighten them she never inspired fear in anyone but they 
knew that when it appeared on her face she became mute and was not to 
be shaken in her determination will change it you said lise and as princess mary 
gave no answer she left the room princess mary was left alone she did not 
comply with request she not only left her hair as it was but did not 
even look in her glass letting her arms fall helplessly she sat with downcast eyes 
and pondered a husband a man a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in 
her imagination and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own she 
fancied a child her as she had seen the day before in the arms of 
her her own breast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the 
child no it is impossible i am too ugly she thought come to tea the 
prince will be out in a moment came the voice at the door she roused 
herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking and before going down she 
went into the room where the icons hung and her eyes fixed on the dark 
face of a large icon of the saviour lit by a lamp she stood before 
it with folded hands for a few moments a painful doubt filled her soul could 
the joy of love of earthly love for a man be for her in her 
thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed of happiness and of children but her strongest most 
deeply hidden longing was for earthly love the more she tried to hide this feeling 
from others and even from herself the stronger it grew god she said am i 
to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil how am i to renounce 
forever these vile fancies so as peacefully to fulfill thy will and scarcely had she 
put that question than god gave her the answer in her own heart nothing for 
thyself seek nothing be not anxious or envious future and thy own fate must remain 
hidden from thee but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything if it 
be will to prove thee in the duties of marriage be ready to fulfill his 
will with this consoling thought but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her 
forbidden earthly longing princess mary sighed and having crossed herself went down thinking neither of 
her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she 
would say what could all that matter in comparison with the will of god without 
whose care not a hair of head can fall chapter iv when princess mary came 
down prince vasíli and his son were already in the drawing room talking to the 
little princess and mademoiselle bourienne when she entered with her heavy step treading on her 
heels the gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princess indicating her to the 
gentlemen said marie princess mary saw them all and saw them in detail she saw 
prince face serious for an instant at the sight of her but immediately smiling again 
and the little princess curiously noting the impression produced on the visitors and she saw 
mademoiselle bourienne with her ribbon and pretty face and her unusually animated look which was 
fixed on him but him she could not see she only saw something large brilliant 
and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room prince vasíli approached first and 
she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by 
saying that on the contrary she remembered him quite well then anatole came up to 
her she still could not see him she only felt a soft hand taking hers 
firmly and she touched with her lips a white forehead over which was beautiful light 
brown hair smelling of pomade when she looked up at him she was struck by 
his beauty anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform his 
chest expanded and his back drawn in slightly swinging one foot and with his head 
a little bent looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not 
thinking about her at all anatole was not quick witted nor ready or eloquent in 
conversation but he had the faculty so invaluable in society of composure and imperturbable self 
possession if a man lacking in self confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and 
betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something 
to say the effect is bad but anatole was dumb swung his foot and smilingly 
examined the hair it was evident that he could be silent in this way for 
a very long time anyone finds this silence inconvenient let him talk but i want 
to he seemed to say besides this in his behavior to women anatole had a 
manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity awe and even supercilious consciousness of his own 
superiority it was as if he said to them know you i know you but 
why should i bother about you be only too glad of course perhaps he did 
not really think this when he met probably he did not for in general he 
thought very his looks and manner gave that impression the princess felt this and as 
if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him 
she turned to his father the conversation was general and animated thanks to princess voice 
and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth she met prince vasíli with 
that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people and consisting in the assumption that 
between the person they so address and themselves there are some semi private long established 
jokes and amusing reminiscences though no such reminiscences really as none existed in this case 
prince vasíli readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew anatole whom she 
hardly knew into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred mademoiselle bourienne also 
shared them and even princess mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry 
reminiscences at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves dear 
prince said the little princess of course in french to prince vasíli not as at 
receptions where you always ran away you remember cette chère annette anna pávlovna but you 
talk politics to me like annette our little tea table yes is it you were 
never at the little princess asked anatole i know i know she said with a 
sly glance brother hippolyte told me about your goings on oh and she shook her 
finger at him have even heard of your doings in paris hippolyte tell you asked 
prince vasíli turning to his son and seizing the little arm as if she would 
have run away and he had just managed to catch her he tell you how 
he himself was pining for the dear princess and how she showed him the door 
oh she is a pearl among women princess he added turning to princess mary when 
paris was mentioned mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the 
general current of recollections she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since 
anatole had left paris and how he had liked that city anatole answered the frenchwoman 
very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to her about her native 
land when he saw the pretty little bourienne anatole came to the conclusion that he 
would not find bald hills dull either at all bad he thought examining her at 
all bad that little companion i hope she will bring her along with her when 
married la petite est gentille the little one is charming the old prince dressed leisurely 
in his study frowning and considering what he was to do the coming of these 
visitors annoyed him are prince vasíli and that son of his to me prince vasíli 
is a shallow braggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled 
to himself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his 
mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one about which he always deceived 
himself the question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter 
and give her to a husband the prince never directly asked himself that question knowing 
beforehand that he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not only with 
his feelings but with the very possibility of life life without princess mary little as 
he seemed to value her was unthinkable to him why should she marry he thought 
be unhappy for certain lise married to better husband one would think could hardly be 
found is she contented with her lot and who would marry marie for love plain 
and awkward take her for her connections and wealth are there no women living unmarried 
and even the happier for it so thought prince bolkónski while dressing and yet the 
question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer prince vasíli had brought his 
son with the evident intention of proposing and today or tomorrow he would probably ask 
for an answer his birth and position in society were not bad nothing against it 
the prince said to himself he must be worthy of her and that is what 
we shall see is what we shall see that is what we shall see he 
added aloud he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing rapidly round 
the company he noticed the change in the little dress mademoiselle ribbon princess unbecoming coiffure 
mademoiselle and smiles and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation herself up 
like a fool he thought looking irritably at her is shameless and he ignores her 
he went straight up to prince vasíli how do how do glad to see you 
laughs at distance began prince vasíli in his usual rapid self confident familiar tone is 
my second son please love and befriend him prince bolkónski surveyed anatole young fellow fine 
young fellow he said come and kiss me and he offered his cheek anatole kissed 
the old man and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure waiting for a 
display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect prince bolkónski sat down 
in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and drawing up an armchair 
for prince vasíli pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news 
he seemed to listen attentively to what prince vasíli said but kept glancing at princess 
mary so they are writing from potsdam already he said repeating prince last words then 
rising he suddenly went up to his daughter it for visitors got yourself up like 
that eh said he very fine you have done up your hair in this new 
way for the visitors and before the visitors i tell you that in future you 
are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent was my 
fault mon père interceded the little princess with a blush must do as you please 
said prince bolkónski bowing to his daughter in law she need not make a fool 
of herself plain enough as it is and he sat down again paying no more 
attention to his daughter who was reduced to tears the contrary that coiffure suits the 
princess very well said prince vasíli you young prince your name said prince bolkónski turning 
to anatole here let us talk and get acquainted the fun begins thought anatole sitting 
down with a smile beside the old prince my dear boy i hear been educated 
abroad not taught to read and write by the deacon like your father and me 
now tell me my dear boy are you serving in the horse guards asked the 
old man scrutinizing anatole closely and intently i have been transferred to the line said 
anatole hardly able to restrain his laughter a good thing so my dear boy you 
wish to serve the tsar and the country it is wartime such a fine fellow 
must serve well are you off to the front prince our regiment has gone to 
the front but i am attached what is it i am attached to papa said 
anatole turning to his father with a laugh splendid soldier splendid am i attached to 
ha ha ha laughed prince bolkónski and anatole laughed still louder suddenly prince bolkónski frowned 
may go he said to anatole anatole returned smiling to the ladies so had him 
educated abroad prince vasíli you said the old prince to prince vasíli have done my 
best for him and i can assure you the education there is much better than 
ours everything is different nowadays everything is changed the a fine fellow a fine fellow 
well come with me now he took prince arm and led him to his study 
as soon as they were alone together prince vasíli announced his hopes and wishes to 
the old prince do you think i shall prevent her that i part from her 
said the old prince angrily an idea ready for it tomorrow only let me tell 
you i want to know my son in law better you know my aboveboard i 
will ask her tomorrow in your presence if she is willing then he can stay 
on he can stay and see the old prince snorted her marry all the same 
to me he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son 
will tell you frankly said prince vasíli in the tone of a crafty man convinced 
of the futility of being cunning with so keen sighted a companion know you see 
right through people anatole is no genius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an 
excellent son or kinsman right all right see as always happens when women lead lonely 
lives for any length of time without male society on appearance all the three women 
of prince household felt that their life had not been real till then their powers 
of reasoning feeling and observing immediately increased tenfold and their life which seemed to have 
been passed in darkness was suddenly lit up by a new brightness full of significance 
princess mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure the handsome open face of 
the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention he seemed to 
her kind brave determined manly and magnanimous she felt convinced of that thousands of dreams 
of a future family life continually rose in her imagination she drove them away and 
tried to conceal them am i not too cold with him thought the princess try 
to be reserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to 
him already but then he cannot know what i think of him and may imagine 
that i do not like him and princess mary tried but could not manage to 
be cordial to her new guest girl devilish ugly thought anatole mademoiselle bourienne also roused 
to great excitement by arrival thought in another way of course she a handsome young 
woman without any definite position without relations or even a country did not intend to 
devote her life to serving prince bolkónski to reading aloud to him and being friends 
with princess mary mademoiselle bourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who able 
to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain badly dressed ungainly russian princesses 
would fall in love with her and carry her off and here at last was 
a russian prince mademoiselle bourienne knew a story heard from her aunt but finished in 
her own way which she liked to repeat to herself it was the story of 
a girl who had been seduced and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre mère 
appeared and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married mademoiselle bourienne was 
often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him her seducer 
and now he a real russian prince had appeared he would carry her away and 
then sa pauvre mère would appear and he would marry her so her future shaped 
itself in mademoiselle head at the very time she was talking to anatole about paris 
it was not calculation that guided her she did not even for a moment consider 
what she should do but all this had long been familiar to her and now 
that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried 
to please him as much as possible the little princess like an old war horse 
that hears the trumpet unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition prepared for the familiar gallop 
of coquetry without any ulterior motive or any struggle but with naïve and lighthearted gaiety 
although in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being 
run after by women his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over 
these three women besides that he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative 
mademoiselle bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness 
and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions after tea the company went 
into the sitting room and princess mary was asked to play on the clavichord anatole 
laughing and in high spirits came and leaned on his elbows facing her and beside 
mademoiselle bourienne princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion her favorite sonata 
bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her 
made that world still more poetic but expression though his eyes were fixed on her 
referred not to her but to the movements of mademoiselle little foot which he was 
then touching with his own under the clavichord mademoiselle bourienne was also looking at princess 
mary and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope 
that was also new to the princess she loves me thought princess mary happy i 
am now and how happy i may be with such a friend and such a 
husband husband can it be possible she thought not daring to look at his face 
but still feeling his eyes gazing at her in the evening after supper when all 
were about to retire anatole kissed princess hand she did not know how she found 
the courage but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to 
her shortsighted eyes turning from princess mary he went up and kissed mademoiselle hand this 
was not etiquette but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance mademoiselle 
bourienne flushed and gave the princess a frightened look delicacy thought the princess it possible 
that mademoiselle bourienne i could be jealous of her and not value her pure affection 
and devotion to me she went up to her and kissed her warmly anatole went 
up to kiss the little hand no no when your father writes to tell me 
that you are behaving well i will give you my hand to kiss not till 
then she said and smilingly raising a finger at him she left the room chapter 
v they all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got 
into bed all kept awake a long time that night he really to be my 
husband this stranger who is so kind that is the chief thing thought princess mary 
and fear which she had seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round 
it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark 
corner and this someone was he was also this man with the white forehead black 
eyebrows and red lips she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in 
her room mademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that 
evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone now working herself up to tears with 
the imaginary words of her pauvre mère rebuking her for her fall the little princess 
grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made she could not lie either 
on her face or on her side every position was awkward and uncomfortable and her 
burden oppressed her now more than ever because presence had vividly recalled to her the 
time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay she 
sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie sleepy and disheveled 
beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time muttering to herself told 
you it was all lumps and holes the little princess repeated should be glad enough 
to fall asleep so not my fault and her voice quivered like that of a 
child about to cry the old prince did not sleep either tíkhon half asleep heard 
him pacing angrily about and snorting the old prince felt as though he had been 
insulted through his daughter the insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself 
but another his daughter whom he loved more than himself he kept telling himself that 
he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should 
act but instead of that he only excited himself more and more first man that 
turns forgets her father and everything else runs upstairs and does up her hair and 
wags her tail and is unlike herself glad to throw her father over and she 
knew i should notice it fr fr fr and i see that that idiot had 
eyes only for shall have to get rid of her and how is it she 
has not pride enough to see it if she has no pride for herself she 
might at least have some for my sake she must be shown that the blockhead 
thinks nothing of her and looks only at bourienne no she has no pride but 
let her see the old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was 
making a mistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne princess self esteem 
would be wounded and his point not to be parted from her would be gained 
so pacifying himself with this thought he called tíkhon and began to undress devil brought 
them here thought he while tíkhon was putting the nightshirt over his dried up old 
body and gray haired chest never invited them they came to disturb my there is 
not much of it left take he muttered while his head was still covered by 
the shirt tíkhon knew his habit of sometimes thinking aloud and therefore met with unaltered 
looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt to bed 
asked the prince tíkhon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of his thoughts 
he guessed that the question referred to prince vasíli and his son have gone to 
bed and put out their lights your excellency good no good said the prince rapidly 
and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his 
dressing gown he went to the couch on which he slept though no words had 
passed between anatole and mademoiselle bourienne they quite understood one another as to the first 
part of their romance up to the appearance of the pauvre mère they understood that 
they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been 
seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone when princess mary went to 
her room at the usual hour mademoiselle bourienne and anatole met in the conservatory princess 
mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation it seemed to her 
that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided that day but 
that they also knew what she thought about it she read this in face and 
in that of prince valet who made her a low bow when she met him 
in the corridor carrying hot water the old prince was very affectionate and careful in 
his treatment of his daughter that morning princess mary well knew this painstaking expression of 
her his face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her 
not understanding a sum in arithmetic when rising from his chair he would walk away 
from her repeating in a low voice the same words several times over he came 
to the point at once treating her ceremoniously have had a proposition made me concerning 
you he said with an unnatural smile expect you have guessed that prince vasíli has 
not come and brought his pupil with for some reason prince bolkónski referred to anatole 
as a the sake of my beautiful eyes last night a proposition was made me 
on your account and as you know my principles i refer it to you am 
i to understand you mon père said the princess growing pale and then blushing understand 
me cried her father angrily vasíli finds you to his taste as a daughter in 
law and makes a proposal to you on his behalf how to be understood understand 
and i ask you do not know what you think father whispered the princess i 
what of me leave me out of the question not going to get married what 
about you what i want to know the princess saw that her father regarded the 
matter with disapproval but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate 
would be decided now or never she lowered her eyes so as not to see 
the gaze under which she felt that she could not think but would only be 
able to submit from habit and she said wish only to do your will but 
if i had to express my own desire she had no time to finish the 
old prince interrupted her admirable he shouted will take you with your dowry and take 
mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain be the wife while you the prince stopped he saw 
the effect these words had produced on his daughter she lowered her head and was 
ready to burst into tears then now then only joking he said this princess i 
hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose i give 
you freedom only remember that your happiness depends on your decision never mind me i 
do not know father no need to talk he receives his orders and will marry 
you or anybody but you are free to choose go to your room think it 
over and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence yes or 
no i know you will pray over it well pray if you like but you 
had better think it over go yes or no yes or no yes or no 
he still shouted when the princess as if lost in a fog had already staggered 
out of the study her fate was decided and happily decided but what her father 
had said about mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful it was untrue to be sure but still 
it was terrible and she could not help thinking of it she was going straight 
on through the conservatory neither seeing nor hearing anything when suddenly the well known whispering 
of mademoiselle bourienne aroused her she raised her eyes and two steps away saw anatole 
embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her with a horrified expression on his handsome 
face anatole looked at princess mary but did not at once take his arm from 
the waist of mademoiselle bourienne who had not yet seen her that why wait a 
moment face seemed to say princess mary looked at them in silence she could not 
understand it at last mademoiselle bourienne gave a scream and ran away anatole bowed to 
princess mary with a gay smile as if inviting her to join in a laugh 
at this strange incident and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led 
to his own apartments an hour later tíkhon came to call princess mary to the 
old prince he added that prince vasíli was also there when tíkhon came to her 
princess mary was sitting on the sofa in her room holding the weeping mademoiselle bourienne 
in her arms and gently stroking her hair the beautiful eyes with all their former 
calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at mademoiselle pretty face princess i 
have lost your affection forever said mademoiselle bourienne i love you more than ever said 
princess mary i will try to do all i can for your happiness you despise 
me you who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion 
oh only my poor mother quite understand answered princess mary with a sad smile yourself 
my dear i will go to my father she said and went out prince vasíli 
with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand was 
sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face as if stirred to 
his core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility when princess mary entered 
he hurriedly took a pinch of snuff my dear my dear he began rising and 
taking her by both hands then sighing he added fate is in your hands decide 
my dear good gentle marie whom i have always loved as a daughter he drew 
back and a real tear appeared in his eye fr snorted prince bolkónski prince is 
making a proposition to you in his mean his do you wish or not to 
be prince anatole wife reply yes or no he shouted then i shall reserve the 
right to state my opinion also yes my opinion and only my opinion added prince 
bolkónski turning to prince vasíli and answering his imploring look or no desire is never 
to leave you father never to separate my life from yours i wish to marry 
she answered positively glancing at prince vasíli and at her father with her beautiful eyes 
nonsense humbug humbug humbug cried prince bolkónski frowning and taking his hand he did not 
kiss her but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it and pressed her 
hand so that she winced and uttered a cry prince vasíli rose dear i must 
tell you that this is a moment i shall never never forget but my dear 
will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart so kind and 
generous say the future is so long say what i have said is all there 
is in my heart i thank you for the honor but i shall never be 
your wife so finished my dear fellow i am very glad to have seen you 
very glad go back to your rooms princess go said the old prince very glad 
to have seen you repeated he embracing prince vasíli vocation is a different one thought 
princess mary vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness the happiness of 
love and self sacrifice and cost what it may i will arrange poor happiness she 
loves him so passionately and so passionately repents i will do all i can to 
arrange the match between them if he is not rich i will give her the 
means i will ask my father and andrew i shall be so happy when she 
is his wife she is so unfortunate a stranger alone helpless and oh god how 
passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself perhaps i might 
have done the same thought princess mary chapter vi it was long since the rostóvs 
had news of nicholas not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter 
addressed in his handwriting on receiving it he ran on tiptoe to his study in 
alarm and haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read the 
letter anna mikháylovna who always knew everything that passed in the house on hearing of 
the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and found the count with 
it in his hand sobbing and laughing at the same time anna mikháylovna though her 
circumstances had improved was still living with the rostóvs dear friend said she in a 
tone of pathetic inquiry prepared to sympathize in any way the count sobbed yet more 
a letter wa a s wounded my darling boy the countess promoted to be an 
officer thank god how tell the little countess anna mikháylovna sat down beside him with 
her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter then having 
dried her own eyes she comforted the count and decided that at dinner and till 
teatime she would prepare the countess and after tea with help would inform her at 
dinner anna mikháylovna talked the whole time about the war news and about nikólenka twice 
asked when the last letter had been received from him though she knew that already 
and remarked that they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day 
each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily 
at the count and at anna mikháylovna the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to 
insignificant matters natásha who of the whole family was the most gifted with a capacity 
to feel any shades of intonation look and expression pricked up her ears from the 
beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father 
and anna mikháylovna that it had something to do with her brother and that anna 
mikháylovna was preparing them for it bold as she was natásha who knew how sensitive 
her mother was to anything relating to nikólenka did not venture to ask any questions 
at dinner but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on 
her chair regardless of her remarks after dinner she rushed headlong after anna mikháylovna and 
dashing at her flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in 
the sitting room darling do tell me what it is my dear dearest sweet one 
honey i give know you know something anna mikháylovna shook her head are a little 
slyboots she said letter from nikólenka sure of it exclaimed natásha reading confirmation in anna 
face for sake be careful you know how it may affect your mamma will i 
will only tell me you then i will go and tell at once anna mikháylovna 
in a few words told her the contents of the letter on condition that she 
should tell no one on my true word of honor said natásha crossing herself tell 
anyone and she ran off at once to sónya wounded a letter she announced in 
gleeful triumph was all sónya said instantly turning white natásha seeing the impression the news 
of her wound produced on sónya felt for the first time the sorrowful side of 
the news she rushed to sónya hugged her and began to cry little wound but 
he has been made an officer he is well now he wrote himself said she 
through her tears now true that all you women are crybabies remarked pétya pacing the 
room with large resolute strides very glad very glad indeed that my brother has distinguished 
himself so you are all blubberers and understand nothing natásha smiled through her tears read 
the letter asked sónya but she said that it was all over and that now 
an officer god said sónya crossing herself perhaps she deceived you let us go to 
mamma pétya paced the room in silence for a time been in place i would 
have killed even more of those frenchmen he said nasty brutes they are have killed 
so many that have been a heap of them your tongue pétya what a goose 
you are not a goose but they are who cry about trifles said pétya you 
remember him natásha suddenly asked after a silence sónya smiled i remember nicholas sónya but 
do you remember so that you remember him perfectly remember everything said natásha with an 
expressive gesture evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning remember nikólenka too 
i remember him well she said i remember borís i remember him a bit you 
remember borís asked sónya in surprise not that i know what he is like but 
not as i remember nikólenka just shut my eyes and remember but borís no she 
shut her eyes nothing at all natásha said sónya looking ecstatically and earnestly at her 
friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to 
say and as if she were saying it to someone else with whom joking was 
out of the question am in love with your brother once for all and whatever 
may happen to him or to me shall never cease to love him as long 
as i live natásha looked at sónya with wondering and inquisitive eyes and said nothing 
she felt that sónya was speaking the truth that there was such love as sónya 
was speaking of but natásha had not yet felt anything like it she believed it 
could be but did not understand it you write to him she asked sónya became 
thoughtful the question of how to write to nicholas and whether she ought to write 
tormented her now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it 
be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations 
to her he had taken on himself know i think if he writes i will 
write too she said blushing you feel ashamed to write to him sónya smiled i 
should be ashamed to write to borís not going to should you be ashamed i 
know awkward and would make me ashamed i know why be ashamed said pétya offended 
by previous remark because she was in love with that fat one in that was 
how pétya described his namesake the new count bezúkhov now in love with that he 
meant italian singing master why ashamed stupid said natásha more stupid than you madam said 
the nine year old pétya with the air of an old brigadier the countess had 
been prepared by anna hints at dinner on retiring to her own room she sat 
in an armchair her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the 
lid of a snuffbox while the tears kept coming into her eyes anna mikháylovna with 
the letter came on tiptoe to the door and paused come in she said to 
the old count who was following her later and she went in closing the door 
behind her the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened at first he 
heard the sound of indifferent voices then anna voice alone in a long speech then 
a cry then silence then both voices together with glad intonations and then footsteps anna 
mikháylovna opened the door her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has 
just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill is done 
she said to the count pointing triumphantly to the countess who sat holding in one 
hand the snuffbox with its portrait and in the other the letter and pressing them 
alternately to her lips when she saw the count she stretched out her arms to 
him embraced his bald head over which she again looked at the letter and the 
portrait and in order to press them again to her lips she slightly pushed away 
the bald head véra natásha sónya and pétya now entered the room and the reading 
of the letter began after a brief description of the campaign and the two battles 
in which he had taken part and his promotion nicholas said that he kissed his 
and hands asking for their blessing and that he kissed véra natásha and pétya besides 
that he sent greetings to monsieur schelling madame schoss and his old nurse and asked 
them to kiss for him sónya whom he loved and thought of just the same 
as ever when she heard this sónya blushed so that tears came into her eyes 
and unable to bear the looks turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall 
whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and 
flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor the countess was crying are you crying 
mamma asked véra all he says one should be glad and not cry this was 
quite true but the count the countess and natásha looked at her reproachfully who is 
it she takes after thought the countess letter was read over hundreds of times and 
those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess for 
she did not let it out of her hands the tutors came and the nurses 
and dmítri and several acquaintances and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh 
pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of virtues how strange how extraordinary 
how joyful it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs 
she had felt twenty years ago within her that son about whom she used to 
have quarrels with the too indulgent count that son who had first learned to say 
and then that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange 
surroundings a manly warrior doing some kind of work of his own without help or 
guidance the universal experience of ages showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle 
to manhood did not exist for the countess her growth toward manhood at each of 
its stages had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the 
millions of human beings who grew up in the same way as twenty years before 
it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever 
cry suck her breast and begin to speak so now she could not believe that 
that little creature could be this strong brave man this model son and officer that 
judging by this letter he now was a style how charmingly he describes said she 
reading the descriptive part of the letter what a soul not a word about himself 
not a word about some denísov or other though he himself i dare say is 
braver than any of them he says nothing about his sufferings what a heart how 
like him it is and how he has remembered everybody not forgetting anyone i always 
said when he was only so always said for more than a week preparations were 
being made rough drafts of letters to nicholas from all the household were written and 
copied out while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count 
money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer 
were collected anna mikháylovna practical woman that she was had even managed by favor with 
army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son she had 
opportunities of sending her letters to the grand duke constantine pávlovich who commanded the guards 
the rostóvs supposed that the russian guards abroad was quite a definite address and that 
if a letter reached the grand duke in command of the guards there was no 
reason why it should not reach the pávlograd regiment which was presumably somewhere in the 
same neighborhood and so it was decided to send the letters and money by the 
grand courier to borís and borís was to forward them to nicholas the letters were 
from the old count the countess pétya véra natásha and sónya and finally there were 
six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to 
his son chapter vii on the twelfth of november active army in camp before olmütz 
was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two russian and the austrian the 
guards just arrived from russia spent the night ten miles from olmütz and next morning 
were to come straight to the review reaching the field at olmütz by ten that 
day nicholas rostóv received a letter from borís telling him that the ismáylov regiment was 
quartered for the night ten miles from olmütz and that he wanted to see him 
as he had a letter and money for him rostóv was particularly in need of 
money now that the troops after their active service were stationed near olmütz and the 
camp swarmed with well provisioned sutlers and austrian jews offering all sorts of tempting wares 
the pávlograds held feast after feast celebrating awards they had received for the campaign and 
made expeditions to olmütz to visit a certain caroline the hungarian who had recently opened 
a restaurant there with girls as waitresses rostóv who had just celebrated his promotion to 
a cornetcy and bought horse bedouin was in debt all round to his comrades and 
the sutlers on receiving letter he rode with a fellow officer to olmütz dined there 
drank a bottle of wine and then set off alone to the camp to find 
his old playmate rostóv had not yet had time to get his uniform he had 
on a shabby cadet jacket decorated with a cross equally shabby riding breeches lined with 
worn leather and an saber with a sword knot the don horse he was riding 
was one he had bought from a cossack during the campaign and he wore a 
crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head as he rode 
up to the camp he thought how he would impress borís and all his comrades 
of the guards by his of a fighting hussar who had been under fire the 
guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their cleanliness 
and discipline they had come by easy stages their knapsacks conveyed on carts and the 
austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place the regiments 
had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the grand orders 
the men had marched all the way in step a practice on which the guards 
prided themselves the officers on foot and at their proper posts borís had been quartered 
and had marched all the way with berg who was already in command of a 
company berg who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign had gained the confidence of 
his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily 
borís during the campaign had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful 
to him and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become 
acquainted with prince andrew bolkónski through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the 
commander in staff berg and borís having rested after march were sitting clean and neatly 
dressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them playing chess berg 
held a smoking pipe between his knees borís in the accurate way characteristic of him 
was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting move 
and watched his face evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of 
whatever he was engaged on how are you going to get out of that he 
remarked try to replied berg touching a pawn and then removing his hand at that 
moment the door opened he is at last shouted rostóv berg too oh you petisenfans 
allay cushay dormir he exclaimed imitating his russian french at which he and borís used 
to laugh long ago me how you have changed borís rose to meet rostóv but 
in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling 
he was about to embrace his friend but nicholas avoided him with that peculiar feeling 
of youth that dread of beaten tracks and wish to express itself in a manner 
different from that of its elders which is often insincere nicholas wished to do something 
special on meeting his friend he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but 
kiss thing everybody did but notwithstanding this borís embraced him in a quiet friendly way 
and kissed him three times they had not met for nearly half a year and 
being at the age when young men take their first steps on road each saw 
immense changes in the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they 
had taken those first steps both had changed greatly since they last met and both 
were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them you 
damned dandies clean and fresh as if been to a fete not like us sinners 
of the line cried rostóv with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice 
new to borís pointing to his own mud bespattered breeches the german landlady hearing loud 
voice popped her head in at the door is she pretty he asked with a 
wink do you shout so frighten them said borís did not expect you today he 
added only sent you the note yesterday by adjutant of a friend of mine i 
did not think he would get it to you so quickly well how are you 
been under fire already asked borís without answering rostóv shook the cross of st george 
fastened to the cording of his uniform and indicating a bandaged arm glanced at berg 
with a smile you see he said yes yes said borís with a smile we 
too have had a splendid march you know of course that his imperial highness rode 
with our regiment all the time so that we had every comfort and every advantage 
what receptions we had in poland what dinners and balls i tell you and the 
tsarévich was very gracious to all our officers and the two friends told each other 
of their doings the one of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line 
the other of the pleasures and advantages of service under members of the imperial family 
you guards said rostóv say send for some wine borís made a grimace you really 
want it said he he went to his bed drew a purse from under the 
clean pillow and sent for wine and i have some money and a letter to 
give you he added rostóv took the letter and throwing the money on the sofa 
put both arms on the table and began to read after reading a few lines 
he glanced angrily at berg then meeting his eyes hid his face behind the letter 
sent you a tidy sum said berg eying the heavy purse that sank into the 
sofa for us count we get along on our pay i can tell you for 
myself say berg my dear fellow said rostóv you get a letter from home and 
meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with and 
i happen to be there go at once to be out of your way do 
go somewhere anywhere to the devil he exclaimed and immediately seizing him by the shoulder 
and looking amiably into his face evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words 
he added be hurt my dear fellow you know i speak from my heart as 
to an old acquaintance mention it count i quite understand said berg getting up and 
speaking in a muffled and guttural voice across to our hosts they invited you added 
borís berg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust 
stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards in the 
way affected by the emperor alexander and having assured himself from the way rostóv looked 
at it that his coat had been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile 
dear what a beast i am muttered rostóv as he read the letter what a 
pig i am not to have written and to have given them such a fright 
oh what a pig i am he repeated flushing suddenly have you sent gabriel for 
some wine all right have some in the letter from his parents was enclosed a 
letter of recommendation to bagratión which the old countess at anna advice had obtained through 
an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take it to its destination 
and make use of it nonsense much i need it said rostóv throwing the letter 
under the table have you thrown that away asked borís is some letter of recommendation 
what the devil do i want it for the said borís picking it up and 
reading the address letter would be of great use to you want nothing and i 
be adjutant not inquired borís a job are still the same dreamer i see remarked 
borís shaking his head still the same diplomatist but not the point come how are 
you asked rostóv as you see so far all right but i confess i should 
much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front when once a 
man starts on military service he should try to make as successful a career of 
it as possible it said rostóv evidently thinking of something else he looked intently and 
inquiringly into his eyes evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question 
old gabriel brought in the wine we now send for berg asked borís would drink 
with you i send for him and how do you get on with that german 
asked rostóv with a contemptuous smile is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow 
answered borís again rostóv looked intently into eyes and sighed berg returned and over the 
bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated the guardsmen told rostóv of 
their march and how they had been made much of in russia poland and abroad 
they spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander the grand duke and told 
stories of his kindness and irascibility berg as usual kept silent when the subject did 
not relate to himself but in connection with the stories of the grand quick temper 
he related with gusto how in galicia he had managed to deal with the grand 
duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the 
irregularity of a movement with a pleasant smile berg related how the grand duke had 
ridden up to him in a violent passion shouting was the favorite expression when he 
was in a rage and called for the company commander you believe it count i 
was not at all alarmed because i knew i was right without boasting you know 
i may say that i know the army orders by heart and know the regulations 
as well as i do the prayer so count there never is any negligence in 
my company and so my conscience was at ease i came forward berg stood up 
and showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it 
would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self complacency than 
his did he stormed at me as the saying is stormed and stormed and stormed 
it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is 
and and siberia said berg with a sagacious smile knew i was in the right 
so i kept silent was not that best count are you dumb he shouted still 
i remained silent and what do you think count the next day it was not 
even mentioned in the orders of the day what keeping head means the way count 
said berg lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke that was fine said rostóv 
smiling but borís noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg and skillfully 
changed the subject he asked him to tell them how and where he got his 
wound this pleased rostóv and he began talking about it and as he went on 
became more and more animated he told them of his schön grabern affair just as 
those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it that is as 
they would like it to have been as they have heard it described by others 
and as sounds well but not at all as it really was rostóv was a 
truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie he began 
his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and inevitably 
he lapsed into falsehood if he had told the truth to his like himself had 
often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack 
was and were expecting to hear just such a would either not have believed him 
or still worse would have thought that rostóv was himself to blame since what generally 
happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him he could not 
tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his 
horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a 
frenchman into the wood besides to tell everything as it really happened it would have 
been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened it is 
very difficult to tell the truth and young people are rarely capable of it his 
hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had 
flown like a storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left 
how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and 
so he told them all that in the middle of his story just as he 
was saying cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack prince andrew 
whom borís was expecting entered the room prince andrew who liked to help young men 
was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward borís who 
had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what the young 
man wanted having been sent with papers from kutúzov to the tsarévich he looked in 
on borís hoping to find him alone when he came in and saw an hussar 
of the line recounting his military exploits prince andrew could not endure that sort of 
man he gave borís a pleasant smile frowned as with half closed eyes he looked 
at rostóv bowed slightly and wearily and sat down languidly on the sofa he felt 
it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company rostóv flushed up on noticing this 
but he did not care this was a mere stranger glancing however at borís he 
saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line in spite of 
prince disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contempt with which rostóv from his fighting 
army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the 
newcomer was evidently one rostóv felt confused blushed and became silent borís inquired what news 
there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one might ask about our 
plans shall probably advance replied bolkónski evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of 
a stranger berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was rumored 
the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled to this prince 
andrew answered with a smile that he could give no opinion on such an important 
government order and berg laughed gaily to your business prince andrew continued addressing borís will 
talk of it and he looked round at rostóv to me after the review and 
we will do what is possible and having glanced round the room prince andrew turned 
to rostóv whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did not 
condescend to notice and said think you were talking of the schön grabern affair were 
you there was there said rostóv angrily as if intending to insult the aide de 
camp bolkónski noticed the state of mind and it amused him with a slightly contemptuous 
smile he said there are many stories now told about that affair stories repeated rostóv 
loudly looking with eyes suddenly grown furious now at borís now at bolkónski many stories 
but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the fire our 
stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who 
get rewards without doing anything whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew 
with a quiet and particularly amiable smile a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of 
respect for this self possession mingled at that moment in soul am not talking about 
you he said know you and frankly i want to i am speaking of the 
staff in general i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a tone of 
quiet authority wish to insult me and i am ready to agree with you that 
it would be very easy to do so if you sufficient self respect but admit 
that the time and place are very badly chosen in a day or two we 
shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel and besides 
drubetskóy who says he is an old friend of yours is not at all to 
blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you however he added rising know 
my name and where to find me but forget that i do not regard either 
myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than 
you my advice is to let the matter drop well then on friday after the 
review i shall expect you drubetskóy au revoir exclaimed prince andrew and with a bow 
to them both he went out only when prince andrew was gone did rostóv think 
of what he ought to have said and he was still more angry at having 
omitted to say it he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of 
borís rode home should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant 
or really let the matter drop was the question that worried him all the way 
he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that 
small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol and then he felt 
with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so 
much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated 
chapter viii the day after rostóv had been to see borís a review was held 
of the austrian and russian troops both those freshly arrived from russia and those who 
had been campaigning under kutúzov the two emperors the russian with his heir the tsarévich 
and the austrian with the archduke inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men from 
early morning the smart clean troops were on the move forming up on the field 
before the fortress now thousands of feet and bayonets moved and halted at the command 
turned with banners flying formed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses of 
infantry in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling 
of showy cavalry in blue red and green braided uniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in 
front mounted on black roan or gray horses then again spreading out with the brazen 
clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the 
smell of linstocks came the artillery which crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took 
up its appointed position not only the generals in full parade uniforms with their thin 
or thick waists drawn in to the utmost their red necks squeezed into their stiff 
collars and wearing scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomaded officers but 
every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished 
to the utmost and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every 
hair of its wetted mane lay that no small matter was happening but an important 
and solemn affair every general and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance aware 
of being but a drop in that ocean of men and yet at the same 
time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole from early 
morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten all had been brought into 
due order the ranks were drawn up on the vast field the whole army was 
extended in three lines the cavalry in front behind it the artillery and behind that 
again the infantry a space like a street was left between each two lines of 
troops the three parts of that army were sharply distinguished fighting army with the pávlograds 
on the right flank of the front those recently arrived from russia both guards and 
regiments of the line and the austrian troops but they all stood in the same 
lines under one command and in a like order like wind over leaves ran an 
excited whisper coming coming alarmed voices were heard and a stir of final preparation swept 
over all the troops from the direction of olmütz in front of them a group 
was seen approaching and at that moment though the day was still a light gust 
of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the 
unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs it looked as if by that slight motion the 
army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the emperors one voice was 
heard shouting front then like the crowing of cocks at sunrise this was repeated by 
others from various sides and all became silent in the deathlike stillness only the tramp 
of horses was heard this was the suites the emperors rode up to the flank 
and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march it seemed as 
though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the army itself rejoicing at the 
approach had naturally burst into music amid these sounds only the youthful kindly voice of 
the emperor alexander was clearly heard he gave the words of greeting and the first 
regiment roared so deafeningly continuously and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their 
multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted rostóv standing in the front lines 
of army which the tsar approached first experienced the same feeling as every other man 
in that army a feeling of self forgetfulness a proud consciousness of might and a 
passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph he felt that at 
a single word from that man all this vast mass and he himself an insignificant 
atom in it would go through fire and water commit crime die or perform deeds 
of highest heroism and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still 
at the imminence of that word hurrah hurrah thundered from all sides one regiment after 
another greeting the tsar with the strains of the march and then then the general 
march and again hurrah growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar 
till the tsar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a 
lifeless body but as soon as he came up it became alive its thunder joining 
the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed through the terrible 
and deafening roar of those voices amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as 
if turned to stone hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and 
above all freely and in front of them two emperors upon them the undivided tensely 
passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated the handsome young emperor alexander 
in the uniform of the horse guards wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front 
and back with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice attracted attention rostóv 
was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight had recognized the tsar 
and watched his approach when he was within twenty paces and nicholas could clearly distinguish 
every detail of his handsome happy young face he experienced a feeling of tenderness and 
ecstasy such as he had never before known every trait and every movement of the 
seemed to him enchanting stopping in front of the pávlograds the tsar said something in 
french to the austrian emperor and smiled seeing that smile rostóv involuntarily smiled himself and 
felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign he longed to show that 
love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry the 
tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him god 
what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me thought rostóv should die 
of happiness the tsar addressed the officers also thank you all gentlemen i thank you 
with my whole heart to rostóv every word sounded like a voice from heaven how 
gladly would he have died at once for his tsar have earned the st standards 
and will be worthy of them to die to die for him thought rostóv the 
tsar said something more which rostóv did not hear and the soldiers straining their lungs 
shouted rostóv too bending over his saddle shouted with all his might feeling that he 
would like to injure himself by that shout if only to express his rapture fully 
the tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided can 
the emperor be undecided thought rostóv but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic 
and enchanting like everything else the tsar did that hesitation lasted only an instant the 
foot in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable touched the groin of the bobtailed bay 
mare he rode his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins and he 
moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides de camp farther and farther 
he rode away stopping at other regiments till at last only his white plumes were 
visible to rostóv from amid the suites that surrounded the emperors among the gentlemen of 
the suite rostóv noticed bolkónski sitting his horse indolently and carelessly rostóv recalled their quarrel 
of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge 
bolkónski course not he now thought it worth thinking or speaking of it at such 
a moment at a time of such love such rapture and such self sacrifice what 
do any of our quarrels and affronts matter i love and forgive everybody now when 
the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops began a ceremonial march past 
him and rostóv on bedouin recently purchased from denísov rode past too at the rear 
of his is alone and in full view of the emperor before he reached him 
rostóv who was a splendid horseman spurred bedouin twice and successfully put him to the 
showy trot in which the animal went when excited bending his foaming muzzle to his 
chest his tail extended bedouin as if also conscious of the eye upon him passed 
splendidly lifting his feet with a high and graceful action as if flying through the 
air without touching the ground rostóv himself his legs well back and his stomach drawn 
in and feeling himself one with his horse rode past the emperor with a frowning 
but blissful face a vewy devil as denísov expressed it fellows the pávlograds remarked the 
emperor god how happy i should be if he ordered me to leap into the 
fire this instant thought rostóv when the review was over the newly arrived officers and 
also collected in groups and began to talk about the awards about the austrians and 
their uniforms about their lines about bonaparte and how badly the latter would fare now 
especially if the essen corps arrived and prussia took our side but the talk in 
every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander his every word and movement was described 
with ecstasy they all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against 
the enemy under the command commanded by the emperor himself they could not fail to 
vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thought rostóv and most of the officers 
after the review all were then more confident of victory than the winning of two 
battles would have made them chapter ix the day after the review borís in his 
best uniform and with his comrade best wishes for success rode to olmütz to see 
bolkónski wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he 
that of adjutant to some important personage a position in the army which seemed to 
him most attractive is all very well for rostóv whose father sends him ten thousand 
rubles at a time to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not 
be lackey but i who have nothing but my brains have to make a career 
and must not miss opportunities but must avail myself of them he reflected he did 
not find prince andrew in olmütz that day but the appearance of the town where 
the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and the two emperors were living with 
their suites households and courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world 
he knew no one and despite his smart uniform all these exalted personages passing in 
the streets in their elegant carriages with their plumes ribbons and medals both courtiers and 
military men seemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of the guards that they 
not only did not wish to but simply could not be aware of his existence 
at the quarters of the commander in chief kutúzov where he inquired for bolkónski all 
the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress 
on him that a great many officers like him were always coming there and that 
everybody was heartily sick of them in spite of this or rather because of it 
next day november 15 after dinner he again went to olmütz and entering the house 
occupied by kutúzov asked for bolkónski prince andrew was in and borís was shown into 
a large hall probably formerly used for dancing but in which five beds now stood 
and furniture of various kinds a table chairs and a clavichord one adjutant nearest the 
door was sitting at the table in a persian dressing gown writing another the red 
stout nesvítski lay on a bed with his arms under his head laughing with an 
officer who had sat down beside him a third was playing a viennese waltz on 
the clavichord while a fourth lying on the clavichord sang the tune bolkónski was not 
there none of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing borís the one who was 
writing and whom borís addressed turned round crossly and told him bolkónski was on duty 
and that he should go through the door on the left into the reception room 
if he wished to see him borís thanked him and went to the reception room 
where he found some ten officers and generals when he entered prince andrew his eyes 
drooping contemptuously with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says it were not 
my duty i would not talk to you for a was listening to an old 
russian general with decorations who stood very erect almost on tiptoe with a obsequious expression 
on his purple face reporting something well then be so good as to wait said 
prince andrew to the general in russian speaking with the french intonation he affected when 
he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing borís prince andrew paying no more heed to 
the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more nodded and turned 
to him with a cheerful smile at that moment borís clearly realized what he had 
before surmised that in the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military 
code which he and the others knew in the regiment there was another more important 
subordination which made this tight laced purple faced general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew 
for his own pleasure chose to chat with lieutenant drubetskóy more than ever was borís 
resolved to serve in future not according to the written code but under this unwritten 
law he felt now that merely by having been recommended to prince andrew he had 
already risen above the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him 
a lieutenant of the guards prince andrew came up to him and took his hand 
am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday i was fussing about with 
germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the dispositions when germans start being 
accurate no end to it borís smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was 
alluding to as something generally known but it was the first time he had heard 
name or even the term my dear fellow so you still want to be an 
adjutant i have been thinking about you i was some reason borís could not help 
asking the commander in chief he has had a letter from prince kurágin about me 
i only wanted to ask because i fear the guards be in action he added 
as if in apology right all right talk it over replied prince andrew let me 
report this business and i shall be at your disposal while prince andrew went to 
report about the purple faced general that not sharing conception of the advantages of the 
unwritten code of so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what 
he had to say to the adjutant that borís felt uncomfortable he turned away and 
waited impatiently for prince return from the commander in room see my dear fellow i 
have been thinking about you said prince andrew when they had gone into the large 
room where the clavichord was no use your going to the commander in chief he 
would say a lot of pleasant things ask you to would not be bad as 
regards the unwritten code thought borís nothing more would come of it there will soon 
be a battalion of us aides de camp and adjutants but this is what do 
i have a good friend an adjutant general and an excellent fellow prince dolgorúkov and 
though you may not know it the fact is that now kutúzov with his staff 
and all of us count for nothing everything is now centered round the emperor so 
we will go to dolgorúkov i have to go there anyhow and i have already 
spoken to him about you we shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself 
or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun prince andrew always became specially 
keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success 
under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another which from pride he would 
never accept for himself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and 
which attracted him he very readily took up cause and went with him to dolgorúkov 
it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmütz occupied by 
the emperors and their retinues that same day a council of war had been held 
in which all the members of the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that 
council contrary to the views of the old generals kutúzov and prince schwartzenberg it had 
been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonaparte the council of war was 
just over when prince andrew accompanied by borís arrived at the palace to find dolgorúkov 
everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the council at which the party 
of the young had triumphed the voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting 
for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by 
such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the 
coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from longer seemed to be in 
the future but in the past all the advantages were on our side our enormous 
forces undoubtedly superior to were concentrated in one place the troops inspired by the presence 
were eager for action the strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar 
in all its details to the austrian general weyrother a lucky accident had ordained that 
the austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the french 
had now to be fought the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail 
on the maps and bonaparte evidently weakened was undertaking nothing dolgorúkov one of the warmest 
advocates of an attack had just returned from the council tired and exhausted but eager 
and proud of the victory that had been gained prince andrew introduced his protégé but 
prince dolgorúkov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to borís and evidently unable 
to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment addressed prince 
andrew in french my dear fellow what a battle we have gained god grant that 
the one that will result from it will be as victorious however dear fellow he 
said abruptly and eagerly must confess to having been unjust to the austrians and especially 
to weyrother what exactitude what minuteness what knowledge of the locality what foresight for every 
eventuality every possibility even to the smallest detail no my dear fellow no conditions better 
than our present ones could have been devised this combination of austrian precision with russian 
more could be wished for the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolkónski do you 
know my dear fellow it seems to me that bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings you 
know that a letter was received from him today for the emperor dolgorúkov smiled significantly 
that so and what did he say inquired bolkónski can he say tra di ri 
di ra and so on merely to gain time i tell you he is in 
our hands certain but what was most amusing he continued with a sudden good natured 
laugh that we could not think how to address the reply if not as and 
of course not as it seemed to me it should be to bonaparte between not 
recognizing him as emperor and calling him general bonaparte there is a difference remarked bolkónski 
just it interrupted dolgorúkov quickly laughing know a very clever fellow he suggested addressing him 
as and enemy of mankind dolgorúkov laughed merrily that said bolkónski the same it was 
bilíbin who found a suitable form for the address he is a wise and clever 
fellow was it the head of the french government au chef du gouvernement français said 
dolgorúkov with grave satisfaction it but he will dislike it extremely said bolkónski yes very 
much my brother knows him dined with present than once in paris and tells me 
he never met a more cunning or subtle know a combination of french adroitness and 
italian play acting do you know the tale about him and count markóv count markóv 
was the only man who knew how to handle him you know the story of 
the handkerchief it is delightful and the talkative dolgorúkov turning now to borís now to 
prince andrew told how bonaparte wishing to test markóv our ambassador purposely dropped a handkerchief 
in front of him and stood looking at markóv probably expecting markóv to pick it 
up for him and how markóv immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it 
up without touching said bolkónski i have come to you prince as a petitioner on 
behalf of this young man you see but before prince andrew could finish an aide 
de camp came in to summon dolgorúkov to the emperor what a nuisance said dolgorúkov 
getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of prince andrew and borís know i should 
be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this 
dear young man again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of 
good natured sincere and animated levity you see another time borís was excited by the 
thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be 
at that moment he was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs 
that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment 
he felt himself a tiny obedient and insignificant atom they followed prince dolgorúkov out into 
the corridor and out of the door of the room by which dolgorúkov had short 
man in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spoiling 
his face gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression this short man nodded 
to dolgorúkov as to an intimate friend and stared at prince andrew with cool intensity 
walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of 
his way prince andrew did neither a look of animosity appeared on his face and 
the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor was that asked 
borís is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of minister of 
foreign affairs prince adam czartorýski it is such men as he who decide the fate 
of nations added bolkónski with a sigh he could not suppress as they passed out 
of the palace next day the army began its campaign and up to the very 
battle of austerlitz borís was unable to see either prince andrew or dolgorúkov again and 
remained for a while with the ismáylov regiment chapter x at dawn on the sixteenth 
of november squadron in which nicholas rostóv served and which was in prince detachment moved 
from the place where it had spent the night advancing into action as arranged and 
after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on 
the highroad rostóv saw the cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars 
and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then generals bagratión and 
dolgorúkov ride past with their adjutants all the fear before action which he had experienced 
as previously all the inner struggle to conquer that fear all his dreams of distinguishing 
himself as a true hussar in this battle had been wasted their squadron remained in 
reserve and nicholas rostóv spent that day in a dull and wretched mood at nine 
in the morning he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah and saw wounded 
being brought back there were not many of them and at last he saw how 
a whole detachment of french cavalry was brought in convoyed by a sótnya of cossacks 
evidently the affair was over and though not big had been a successful engagement the 
men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory of the occupation of the town 
of wischau and the capture of a whole french squadron the day was bright and 
sunny after a sharp night frost and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was 
in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed not only by the tales 
of those who had taken part in it but also by the joyful expression on 
the faces of soldiers officers generals and adjutants as they passed rostóv going or coming 
and nicholas who had vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had 
spent that happy day in inactivity was all the more depressed here wostóv dwink to 
dwown our gwief shouted denísov who had settled down by the roadside with a flask 
and some food the officers gathered round canteen eating and talking they are bringing another 
cried one of the officers indicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in 
on foot by two cossacks one of them was leading by the bridle a fine 
large french horse he had taken from the prisoner us that horse denísov called out 
to the cossacks you like your honor the officers got up and stood round the 
cossacks and their prisoner the french dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with 
a german accent he was breathless with agitation his face was red and when he 
heard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officers addressing first one 
then another he said he would not have been taken it was not his fault 
but the who had sent him to seize some horsecloths though he had told him 
the russians were there and at every word he added hurt my little horse and 
stroked the animal it was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was 
now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now imagining himself before his 
own officers insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service he brought with 
him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the french army which was 
so alien to us the cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces and rostóv 
being the richest of the officers now that he had received his money bought it 
hurt my little horse said the alsatian good naturedly to rostóv when the animal was 
handed over to the hussar rostóv smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money alley 
said the cossack touching the arm to make him go on emperor the emperor was 
suddenly heard among the hussars all began to run and bustle and rostóv saw coming 
up the road behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats in a 
moment everyone was in his place waiting rostóv did not know or remember how he 
ran to his place and mounted instantly his regret at not having been in action 
and his dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every 
thought of himself had vanished he was filled with happiness at his nearness to the 
emperor he felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day 
he had lost he was happy as a lover when the longed for moment of 
meeting arrives not daring to look round and without looking round he was ecstatically conscious 
of his approach he felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of 
the approaching cavalcade but because as he drew near everything grew brighter more joyful more 
significant and more festive around him nearer and nearer to rostóv came that sun shedding 
beams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himself enveloped in those 
beams he heard his voice that kindly calm and majestic voice that was yet so 
simple and as if in accord with feeling there was a deathly stillness amid which 
was heard the voice pávlograd hussars he inquired reserves sire replied a voice a very 
human one compared to that which had said pávlograd hussars the emperor drew level with 
rostóv and halted face was even more beautiful than it had been three days before 
at the review it shone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it 
suggested the liveliness of a fourteen year old boy and yet it was the face 
of the majestic emperor casually while surveying the squadron the eyes met and rested on 
them for not more than two seconds whether or no the emperor understood what was 
going on in soul it seemed to rostóv that he understood everything at any rate 
his light blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into face a gentle mild light 
poured from them then all at once he raised his eyebrows abruptly touched his horse 
with his left foot and galloped on the younger emperor could not restrain his wish 
to be present at the battle and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers 
at twelve left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the 
vanguard before he came up with the hussars several adjutants met him with news of 
the successful result of the action this battle which consisted in the capture of a 
french squadron was represented as a brilliant victory over the french and so the emperor 
and the whole army especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield believed that the 
french had been defeated and were retreating against their will a few minutes after the 
emperor had passed the pávlograd division was ordered to advance in wischau itself a petty 
german town rostóv saw the emperor again in the market place where there had been 
some rather heavy firing before the arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there 
had not been time to move the emperor surrounded by his suite of officers and 
courtiers was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare a different one from that which he had 
ridden at the review and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette 
to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone with blood on his 
uncovered head the wounded soldier was so dirty coarse and revolting that his proximity to 
the emperor shocked rostóv rostóv saw how the rather round shoulders shuddered as if a 
cold shiver had run down them how his left foot began convulsively tapping the side 
with the spur and how the well trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not 
stir an adjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on a 
stretcher that had been brought the soldier groaned gently you do it more gently said 
the emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode away rostóv saw 
tears filling the eyes and heard him as he was riding away say to czartorýski 
a terrible thing war is what a terrible thing quelle terrible chose que la guerre 
the troops of the vanguard were stationed before wischau within sight of the lines which 
all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing the gratitude was 
announced to the vanguard rewards were promised and the men received a double ration of 
vodka the campfires crackled and the songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous 
night denísov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major and rostóv who had already 
drunk enough at the end of the feast proposed the health sovereign the emperor as 
they say at official dinners said he the health of our sovereign that good enchanting 
and great man let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of 
the french we fought before he said letting the french pass as at schön grabern 
what shall we not do now when he is at the front we will all 
die for him gladly is it not so gentlemen perhaps i am not saying it 
right i have drunk a good that is how i feel and so do you 
too to the health of alexander the first hurrah rang the enthusiastic voices of the 
officers and the old cavalry captain kírsten shouted enthusiastically and no less sincerely than the 
twenty year old rostóv when the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses kírsten filled 
others and in shirt sleeves and breeches went glass in hand to the bonfires and 
with his long gray mustache his white chest showing under his open shirt he stood 
in a majestic pose in the light of the campfire waving his uplifted arm to 
our sovereign the emperor and victory over our enemies hurrah he exclaimed in his dashing 
old baritone the hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts late that night 
when all had separated denísov with his short hand patted his favorite rostóv on the 
shoulder no one to fall in love with on campaign fallen in love with the 
tsar he said make fun of it cried rostóv is such a lofty beautiful feeling 
such a believe it i believe it fwiend and i share and appwove you understand 
and rostóv got up and went wandering among the campfires dreaming of what happiness it 
would be to in saving the life he did not even dare to dream of 
that but simply to die before his eyes he really was in love with the 
tsar and the glory of the russian arms and the hope of future triumph and 
he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding 
the battle of austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the russian army were then 
in love though less ecstatically with their tsar and the glory of the russian arms 
chapter xi the next day the emperor stopped at wischau and villier his physician was 
repeatedly summoned to see him at headquarters and among the troops near by the news 
spread that the emperor was unwell he ate nothing and had slept badly that night 
those around him reported the cause of this indisposition was the strong impression made on 
his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and wounded at daybreak on the 
seventeenth a french officer who had come with a flag of truce demanding an audience 
with the russian emperor was brought into wischau from our outposts this officer was savary 
the emperor had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait at midday 
he was admitted to the emperor and an hour later he rode off with prince 
dolgorúkov to the advanced post of the french army it was rumored that savary had 
been sent to propose to alexander a meeting with napoleon to the joy and pride 
of the whole army a personal interview was refused and instead of the sovereign prince 
dolgorúkov the victor at wischau was sent with savary to negotiate with napoleon if contrary 
to expectations these negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace toward evening dolgorúkov 
came back went straight to the tsar and remained alone with him for a long 
time on the eighteenth and nineteenth of november the army advanced two march and the 
outposts after a brief interchange of shots retreated in the highest army circles from midday 
on the nineteenth a great excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of 
the twentieth when the memorable battle of austerlitz was fought till midday on the nineteenth 
the eager talk running to and fro and dispatching of confined to the headquarters but 
on the afternoon of that day this activity reached headquarters and the staffs of the 
commanders of columns by evening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts 
of the army and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the whole 
eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices and the 
army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long the concentrated activity which 
had begun at the headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that 
followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock 
one wheel slowly moved another was set in motion and a third and wheels began 
to revolve faster and faster levers and cogwheels to work chimes to play figures to 
pop out and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result of all 
that activity just as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of 
the military machine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just as 
indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of 
the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached wheels creak on their axles as 
the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their 
movement but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared 
to remain so for a hundred years but the moment comes when the lever catches 
it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the common 
motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken just as in a 
clock the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a 
slow and regular movement of the hands which show the time so the result of 
all the complicated human activities of 160 000 russians and their passions desires remorse humiliations 
sufferings outbursts of pride fear and only the loss of the battle of austerlitz the 
so called battle of the three is to say a slow movement of the hand 
on the dial of human history prince andrew was on duty that day and in 
constant attendance on the commander in chief at six in the evening kutúzov went to 
the headquarters and after staying but a short time with the tsar went to see 
the grand marshal of the court count tolstóy bolkónski took the opportunity to go in 
to get some details of the coming action from dolgorúkov he felt that kutúzov was 
upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him and 
also that at the headquarters everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know 
something others do not know he therefore wished to speak to dolgorúkov how do my 
dear fellow said dolgorúkov who was sitting at tea with bilíbin fete is for tomorrow 
how is your old fellow out of sorts say he is out of sorts but 
i fancy he would like to be heard they heard him at the council of 
war and will hear him when he talks sense but to temporize and wait for 
something now when bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible you 
have seen him said prince andrew what is bonaparte like how did he impress you 
i saw him and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a general 
engagement repeated dolgorúkov evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his 
interview with napoleon he afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview 
why negotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat is so contrary to his 
method of conducting war believe me he is afraid afraid of a general battle his 
hour has come mark my words tell me what is he like eh said prince 
andrew again is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should call 
him majesty but who to his chagrin got no title from me the sort of 
man he is and nothing more replied dolgorúkov looking round at bilíbin with a smile 
my great respect for old kutúzov he continued should be a nice set of fellows 
if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to escape or 
to trick us now that we certainly have him in our hands no we forget 
suvórov and his to put yourself in a position to be attacked but yourself to 
attack believe me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better 
than all the experience of old cunctators in what position are we going to attack 
him i have been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where 
his chief forces are situated said prince andrew he wished to explain to dolgorúkov a 
plan of attack he had himself formed that is all the same dolgorúkov said quickly 
and getting up he spread a map on the table eventualities have been foreseen if 
he is standing before brünn and prince dolgorúkov rapidly but indistinctly explained plan of a 
flanking movement prince andrew began to reply and to state his own plan which might 
have been as good as but for the disadvantage that had already been approved as 
soon as prince andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits 
of his own plan prince dolgorúkov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent mindedly 
not at the map but at prince face will be a council of war at 
tonight though you can say all this there remarked dolgorúkov will do so said prince 
andrew moving away from the map are you bothering about gentlemen said bilíbin who till 
then had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now was evidently ready 
with a joke tomorrow brings victory or defeat the glory of our russian arms is 
secure except your kutúzov there is not a single russian in command of a column 
the commanders are herr general wimpfen le comte de langeron le prince de lichtenstein le 
prince de hohenlohe and finally prishprish and so on like all those polish names quiet 
backbiter said dolgorúkov is not true there are now two russians milorádovich and dokhtúrov and 
there would be a third count arakchéev if his nerves were not too weak i 
think general kutúzov has come out said prince andrew wish you good luck and success 
gentlemen he added and went out after shaking hands with dolgorúkov and bilíbin on the 
way home prince andrew could not refrain from asking kutúzov who was sitting silently beside 
him what he thought of battle kutúzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a 
pause replied think the battle will be lost and so i told count tolstóy and 
asked him to tell the emperor what do you think he replied my dear general 
i am engaged with rice and cutlets look after military matters yourself yes that was 
the answer i got chapter xii shortly after nine that evening weyrother drove with his 
plans to quarters where the council of war was to be held all the commanders 
of columns were summoned to the commander in and with the exception of prince bagratión 
who declined to come were all there at the appointed time weyrother who was in 
full control of the proposed battle by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast 
to the dissatisfied and drowsy kutúzov who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president 
of the council of war weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the head of 
a movement that had already become unrestrainable he was like a horse running downhill harnessed 
to a heavy cart whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he 
did not know but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what 
this movement might lead to weyrother had been twice that evening to the picket line 
to reconnoiter personally and twice to the emperors russian and austrian to report and explain 
and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in german and now much 
exhausted he arrived at he was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be 
polite to the commander in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctly without looking 
at the man he was addressing and did not reply to questions put to him 
he was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful weary and distracted air though at 
the same time he was haughty and self confident kutúzov was occupying a castle of 
modest dimensions near ostralitz in the large drawing room which had become the commander in 
office were gathered kutúzov himself weyrother and the members of the council of war they 
were drinking tea and only awaited prince bagratión to begin the council at last orderly 
came with the news that the prince could not attend prince andrew came in to 
inform the commander in chief of this and availing himself of permission previously given him 
by kutúzov to be present at the council he remained in the room prince bagratión 
is not coming we may begin said weyrother hurriedly rising from his seat and going 
up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs of brünn was 
spread out kutúzov with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his 
collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low chair with his podgy 
old hands resting symmetrically on its arms at the sound of voice he opened his 
one eye with an effort yes if you please it is already late said he 
and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye if at 
first the members of the council thought that kutúzov was pretending to sleep the sounds 
his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at 
that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show 
his contempt for the dispositions or anything was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need 
for sleep he really was asleep weyrother with the gesture of a man too busy 
to lose a moment glanced at kutúzov and having convinced himself that he was asleep 
took up a paper and in a loud monotonous voice began to read out the 
dispositions for the impending battle under a heading which he also read out for an 
attack on the enemy position behind kobelnitz and sokolnitz november 30 1805 the dispositions were 
very complicated and difficult they began as follows the left wing rests on wooded hills 
and his right extends along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there while 
we on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank his right it 
is advantageous to attack the latter wing especially if we occupy the villages of sokolnitz 
and kobelnitz whereby we can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the 
plain between schlappanitz and the thuerassa forest avoiding the defiles of schlappanitz and bellowitz which 
cover the front for this object it is necessary that the first column marches the 
second column marches the third column marches and so on read weyrother the generals seemed 
to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions the tall fair haired general buxhöwden stood leaning 
his back against the wall his eyes fixed on a burning candle and seemed not 
to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen exactly opposite weyrother with 
his glistening wide open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards sat the 
ruddy milorádovich in a military pose his elbows turned outwards his hands on his knees 
and his shoulders raised he remained stubbornly silent gazing at face and only turned away 
his eyes when the austrian chief of staff finished reading then milorádovich looked round significantly 
at the other generals but one could not tell from that significant look whether he 
agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements next to weyrother sat 
count langeron who with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern french face 
during the whole time of the reading gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled 
by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait in the middle of 
one of the longest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raised his 
head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips interrupted weyrother 
wishing to say something but the austrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked 
his elbows as if to say can tell me your views later but now be 
so good as to look at the map and listen langeron lifted his eyes with 
an expression of perplexity turned round to milorádovich as if seeking an explanation but meeting 
the impressive but meaningless gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his 
snuffbox geography lesson he muttered as if to himself but loud enough to be heard 
przebyszéwski with respectful but dignified politeness held his hand to his ear toward weyrother with 
the air of a man absorbed in attention dohktúrov a little man sat opposite weyrother 
with an assiduous and modest mien and stooping over the outspread map conscientiously studied the 
dispositions and the unfamiliar locality he asked weyrother several times to repeat words he had 
not clearly heard and the difficult names of villages weyrother complied and dohktúrov noted them 
down when the reading which lasted more than an hour was over langeron again brought 
his snuffbox to rest and without looking at weyrother or at anyone in particular began 
to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the 
position was assumed to be known whereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy 
was in movement objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was 
to show general had read his dispositions with as much self confidence as if he 
were addressing school he had to do not with fools but with men who could 
teach him something in military matters when the monotonous sound of voice ceased kutúzov opened 
his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel 
is interrupted he listened to what langeron said as if remarking you are still at 
that silly business quickly closed his eye again and let his head sink still lower 
langeron trying as virulently as possible to sting vanity as author of the military plan 
argued that bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked and so render the whole 
of this plan perfectly worthless weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous smile 
evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what they might he could attack 
us he would have done so today said he you think he is powerless said 
langeron has forty thousand men at most replied weyrother with the smile of a doctor 
to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case that case 
he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack said langeron with a subtly ironical 
smile again glancing round for support to milorádovich who was near him but milorádovich was 
at that moment evidently thinking of anything rather than of what the generals were disputing 
about foi said he we shall see all that on the battlefield weyrother again gave 
that smile which seemed to say that to him it was strange and ridiculous to 
meet objections from russian generals and to have to prove to them what he had 
not merely convinced himself of but had also convinced the sovereign emperors of enemy has 
quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from his camp said he does 
that mean either he is retreating which is the only thing we need fear or 
he is changing his position he smiled ironically even if he also took up a 
position in the thuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all 
our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same is that began prince andrew who 
had for long been waiting an opportunity to express his doubts kutúzov here woke up 
coughed heavily and looked round at the generals the dispositions for rather for today for 
it is past now be altered said he have heard them and we shall all 
do our duty but before a battle there is nothing more important he paused to 
have a good sleep he moved as if to rise the generals bowed and retired 
it was past midnight prince andrew went out the council of war at which prince 
andrew had not been able to express his opinion as he had hoped to left 
on him a vague and uneasy impression whether dolgorúkov and weyrother or kutúzov langeron and 
the others who did not approve of the plan of attack were did not know 
was it really not possible for kutúzov to state his views plainly to the emperor 
is it possible that on account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of 
lives and my life my life he thought be risked it is very likely that 
i shall be killed tomorrow he thought and suddenly at this thought of death a 
whole series of most distant most intimate memories rose in his imagination he remembered his 
last parting from his father and his wife he remembered the days when he first 
loved her he thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself 
and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in 
which he was billeted with nesvítski and began to walk up and down before it 
the night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed mysteriously tomorrow tomorrow he 
thought everything may be over for me all these memories will be no more none 
of them will have any meaning for me tomorrow perhaps even certainly i have a 
presentiment that for the first time i shall have to show all i can do 
and his fancy pictured the battle its loss the concentration of fighting at one point 
and the hesitation of all the commanders and then that happy moment that toulon for 
which he had so long waited presents itself to him at last he firmly and 
clearly expresses his opinion to kutúzov to weyrother and to the emperors all are struck 
by the justness of his views but no one undertakes to carry them out so 
he takes a regiment a that no one is to interfere with his his division 
to the decisive point and gains the victory alone death and suffering suggested another voice 
prince andrew however did not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs 
the dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone nominally he is only 
an adjutant on staff but he does everything alone the next battle is won by 
him alone kutúzov is removed and he is appointed and then asked the other voice 
before that you are not ten times wounded killed or betrayed well what then then 
prince andrew answered himself know what will happen and want to know and but if 
i want glory want to be known to men want to be loved by them 
it is not my fault that i want it and want nothing but that and 
live only for that yes for that alone i shall never tell anyone but oh 
god what am i to do if i love nothing but fame and esteem death 
wounds the loss of fear nothing and precious and dear as many persons are to 
sister dearest to dreadful and unnatural as it seems i would give them all at 
once for a moment of glory of triumph over men of love from men i 
know and never shall know for the love of these men here he thought as 
he listened to voices in courtyard the voices were those of the orderlies who were 
packing up one voice probably a was teasing old cook whom prince andrew knew and 
who was called tit he was saying i say tit returned the old man tit 
thresh a bit said the wag go to the devil called out a voice drowned 
by the laughter of the orderlies and servants the same i love and value nothing 
but triumph over them all i value this mystic power and glory that is floating 
here above me in this mist chapter xiii that same night rostóv was with a 
platoon on skirmishing duty in front of detachment his hussars were placed along the line 
in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that 
kept coming over him an enormous space with our campfires dimly glowing in the fog 
could be seen behind him in front of him was misty darkness rostóv could see 
nothing peer as he would into that foggy distance now something gleamed gray now there 
was something black now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be 
now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes his eyes kept closing 
and in his fancy the emperor now denísov and now moscow he again hurriedly opened 
his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he 
was riding and sometimes when he came within six paces of them the black figures 
of hussars but in the distance was still the same misty darkness not it might 
easily happen thought rostóv the emperor will meet me and give me an order as 
he would to any other officer say and find out there there are many stories 
of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching 
him to himself what if he gave me a place near him oh how i 
would guard him how i would tell him the truth how i would unmask his 
deceivers and in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign rostóv pictured 
to himself an enemy or a deceitful german whom he would not only kill with 
pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the emperor suddenly a distant 
shout aroused him he started and opened his eyes am i oh yes in the 
skirmishing line pass and olmütz what a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve 
tomorrow he thought ask leave to go to the front this may be my only 
chance of seeing the emperor it be long now before i am off duty take 
another turn and when i get back go to the general and ask him he 
readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round 
his hussars it seemed to him that it was getting lighter to the left he 
saw a sloping descent lit up and facing it a black knoll that seemed as 
steep as a wall on this knoll there was a white patch that rostóv could 
not at all make out was it a glade in the wood lit up by 
the moon or some unmelted snow or some white houses he even thought something moved 
on that white spot expect snow that spot a tache he thought now not a 
tache natásha sister black eyes na tasha she be surprised when i tell her how 
seen the emperor natásha take my sabretache to the right your honor there are bushes 
here came the voice of an hussar past whom rostóv was riding in the act 
of falling asleep rostóv lifted his head that had sunk almost to his mane and 
pulled up beside the hussar he was succumbing to irresistible youthful childish drowsiness what was 
i thinking i forget how shall i speak to the emperor no not tomorrow oh 
yes natásha sabretache saber them whom the hussars ah the hussars with mustaches along the 
tverskáya street rode the hussar with mustaches i thought about him too just opposite house 
old gúryev oh but a fine fellow but all nonsense the chief thing is that 
the emperor is here how he looked at me and wished to say something but 
dared not no it was i who dared not but nonsense the chief thing is 
not to forget the important thing i was thinking of yes na tásha sabretache oh 
yes yes right and his head once more sank to his neck all at once 
it seemed to him that he was being fired at what what cut them down 
what said rostóv waking up at the moment he opened his eyes he heard in 
front of him where the enemy was the long drawn shouts of thousands of voices 
his horse and the horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these 
shouts over there where the shouting came from a fire flared up and went out 
again then another and all along the french line on the hill fires flared up 
and the shouting grew louder and louder rostóv could hear the sound of french words 
but could not distinguish them the din of many voices was too great all he 
could hear was and that what do you make of it said rostóv to the 
hussar beside him must be the camp the hussar did not reply you hear it 
rostóv asked again after waiting for a reply can tell your honor replied the hussar 
reluctantly the direction it must be the enemy repeated rostóv may be he or it 
may be nothing muttered the hussar dark steady he cried to his fidgeting horse horse 
was also getting restive it pawed the frozen ground pricking its ears at the noise 
and looking at the lights the shouting grew still louder and merged into a general 
roar that only an army of several thousand men could produce the lights spread farther 
and farther probably along the line of the french camp rostóv no longer wanted to 
sleep the gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him 
he now heard distinctly be far off probably just beyond the stream he said to 
the hussar beside him the hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily the sound 
of hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard and out 
of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly appeared looming huge 
as an elephant honor the generals said the sergeant riding up to rostóv rostóv still 
looking round toward the fires and the shouts rode with the sergeant to meet some 
mounted men who were riding along the line one was on a white horse prince 
bagratión and prince dolgorúkov with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of 
the lights and shouts in the camp rostóv rode up to bagratión reported to him 
and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying me said prince 
dolgorúkov addressing bagratión is nothing but a trick he has retreated and ordered the rearguard 
to kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us said bagratión saw them this 
evening on that knoll if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too 
officer said bagratión to rostóv the skirmishers still there were there this evening but now 
i know your excellency shall i go with some of my hussars to see replied 
rostóv bagratión stopped and before replying tried to see face in the mist go and 
see he said after a pause sir rostóv spurred his horse called to sergeant fédchenko 
and two other hussars told them to follow him and trotted downhill in the direction 
from which the shouting came he felt both frightened and pleased to be riding alone 
with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance where no one had been 
before him bagratión called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream 
but rostóv pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and 
on continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes 
having descended the hill at a trot he no longer saw either our own or 
the fires but heard the shouting of the french more loudly and distinctly in the 
valley he saw before him something like a river but when he reached it he 
found it was a road having come out onto the road he reined in his 
horse hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black 
field up the hillside to keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist 
would have been safer because it would be easier to see people coming along it 
me said he crossed the road and began riding up the hill at a gallop 
toward the point where the french pickets had been standing that evening honor there he 
is cried one of the hussars behind him and before rostóv had time to make 
out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog there was 
a flash followed by a report and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist 
with a plaintive sound passed out of hearing another musket missed fire but flashed in 
the pan rostóv turned his horse and galloped back four more reports followed at intervals 
and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones rostóv reined in 
his horse whose spirits had risen like his own at the firing and went back 
at a footpace some more some more a merry voice was saying in his soul 
but no more shots came only when approaching bagratión did rostóv let his horse gallop 
again and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general dolgorúkov was 
still insisting that the french had retreated and had only lit fires to deceive us 
does that prove he was saying as rostóv rode up might retreat and leave the 
pickets plain that they have not all gone yet prince said bagratión till tomorrow morning 
find out everything tomorrow picket is still on the hill your excellency just where it 
was in the evening reported rostóv stooping forward with his hand at the salute and 
unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride and especially by the 
sound of the bullets good very good said bagratión you officer excellency said rostóv i 
ask a favor is it our squadron is to be in reserve may i ask 
to be attached to the first squadron your name rostóv very well you may stay 
in attendance on me ilyá son asked dolgorúkov but rostóv did not reply i may 
reckon on it your excellency will give the order very likely i may be sent 
with some message to the emperor thought rostóv god the fires and shouting in the 
army were occasioned by the fact that while proclamation was being read to the troops 
the emperor himself rode round his bivouacs the soldiers on seeing him lit wisps of 
straw and ran after him shouting proclamation was as follows soldiers the russian army is 
advancing against you to avenge the austrian army of ulm they are the same battalions 
you broke at hollabrünn and have pursued ever since to this place the position we 
occupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round me on 
the right they will expose a flank to me soldiers i will myself direct your 
battalions i will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor carry disorder 
and confusion into the ranks but should victory be in doubt even for a moment 
you will see your emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy for 
there must be no doubt of victory especially on this day when what is at 
stake is the honor of the french infantry so necessary to the honor of our 
nation do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded let every 
man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings of england 
inspired by such hatred of our nation this victory will conclude our campaign and we 
can return to winter quarters where fresh french troops who are being raised in france 
will join us and the peace i shall conclude will be worthy of my people 
of you and of myself napoleon chapter xiv at five in the morning it was 
still quite dark the troops of the center the reserves and right flank had not 
yet moved but on the left flank the columns of infantry cavalry and artillery which 
were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the french right flank 
and drive it into the bohemian mountains according to plan were already up and astir 
the smoke of the campfires into which they were throwing everything superfluous made the eyes 
smart it was cold and dark the officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting the 
soldiers munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves gathering round 
the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds chairs tables wheels tubs and 
everything that they did not want or could not carry away with them austrian column 
guides were moving in and out among the russian troops and served as heralds of 
the advance as soon as an austrian officer showed himself near a commanding quarters the 
regiment began to move the soldiers ran from the fires thrust their pipes into their 
boots their bags into the carts got their muskets ready and formed rank the officers 
buttoned up their coats buckled on their swords and pouches and moved along the ranks 
shouting the train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the 
loads the adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders mounted crossed themselves gave final instructions orders 
and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind and the monotonous tramp of thousands 
of feet resounded the column moved forward without knowing where and unable from the masses 
around them the smoke and the increasing fog to see either the place they were 
leaving or that to which they were going a soldier on the march is hemmed 
in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his 
ship however far he has walked whatever strange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just 
as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks masts and rigging of his 
ship so the soldier always has around him the same comrades the same ranks the 
same sergeant major iván mítrich the same company dog jack and the same commanders the 
sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing but on 
the day of knows how and stern note of which all are conscious sounds in 
the moral atmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn and 
awakening in the men an unusual curiosity on the day of battle the soldiers excitedly 
try to get beyond the interests of their regiment they listen intently look about and 
eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them the fog had grown so dense 
that though it was growing light they could not see ten paces ahead bushes looked 
like gigantic trees and level ground like cliffs and slopes anywhere on any side one 
might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off but the columns advanced for a long 
time always in the same fog descending and ascending hills avoiding gardens and enclosures going 
over new and unknown ground and nowhere encountering the enemy on the contrary the soldiers 
became aware that in front behind and on all sides other russian columns were moving 
in the same direction every soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place 
where he was going many more of our men were going too now the kúrskies 
have also gone past was being said in the ranks wonderful what a lot of 
our troops have gathered lads last night i looked at the campfires and there was 
no end of them a regular moscow though none of the column commanders rode up 
to the ranks or talked to the men the commanders as we saw at the 
council of war were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did 
not exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders yet the 
troops marched gaily as they always do when going into action especially to an attack 
but when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog the greater 
part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and 
blunder spread through the ranks how such a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to 
define but it certainly is communicated very surely and flows rapidly imperceptibly and irrepressibly as 
water does in a creek had the russian army been alone without any allies it 
might perhaps have been a long time before this consciousness of mismanagement became a general 
conviction but as it was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid 
germans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been occasioned by the sausage 
eaters have we stopped is the way blocked or have we already come up against 
the french one hear them be firing if we had were in a hurry enough 
to start us and now here we stand in the middle of a field without 
rhyme or reason all those damned muddling what stupid devils send them on in front 
but no fear crowding up behind and now here we stand hungry say shall we 
soon be clear they say the cavalry are blocking the way said an officer those 
damned germans they know their own country said another division are you shouted an adjutant 
riding up eighteenth why are you here you should have gone on long ago now 
you get there till evening stupid orders they themselves know what they are doing said 
the officer and rode off then a general rode past shouting something angrily not in 
russian lafa but what jabbering no one can make out said a soldier mimicking the 
general who had ridden away shoot them the scoundrels were ordered to be at the 
place before nine but we got halfway fine orders was being repeated on different sides 
and the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn into 
vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the germans the cause of the 
confusion was that while the austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank the higher 
command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the 
cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry crossed in 
front of the infantry who had to wait at the front an altercation occurred between 
an austrian guide and a russian general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry 
should be halted the austrian argued that not he but the higher command was to 
blame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited after an delay they at last 
moved on descending the hill the fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still 
more densely below where they were descending in front in the fog a shot was 
heard and then another at first irregularly at varying then more and more regularly and 
rapidly and the action at the goldbach stream began not expecting to come on the 
enemy down by the stream and having stumbled on him in the fog hearing no 
encouraging word from their commanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through 
the ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them 
in the thick fog the russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and 
again halted receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in 
the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments in this way 
the action began for the first second and third columns which had gone down into 
the valley the fourth column with which kutúzov was stood on the pratzen heights below 
where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on the higher ground it 
was clearing but nothing could be seen of what was going on in front whether 
all the enemy forces were as we supposed six miles away or whether they were 
near by in that sea of mist no one knew till after eight it was 
nine in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a sea down below but higher 
up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon stood with his marshals around him it 
was quite light above him was a clear blue sky and the vast orb quivered 
like a huge hollow crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist 
the whole french army and even napoleon himself with his staff were not on the 
far side of the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we intended 
to take up our position and begin the action but were on this side so 
close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted 
man from one on foot napoleon in the blue cloak which he had worn on 
his italian campaign sat on his small gray arab horse a little in front of 
his marshals he gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the 
sea of mist and on which the russian troops were moving in the distance and 
he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley not a single muscle of 
his in those days was still his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot 
his predictions were being justified part of the russian force had already descended into the 
valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these pratzen heights which he 
intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position he saw over the 
mist that in a hollow between two hills near the village of pratzen the russian 
columns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing 
one after another into the mist from information he had received the evening before from 
the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night by the 
disorderly movement of the russian columns and from all indications he saw clearly that the 
allies believed him to be far away in front of them and that the columns 
moving near pratzen constituted the center of the russian army and that that center was 
already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked but still he did not begin the engagement 
today was a great day for anniversary of his coronation before dawn he had slept 
for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and in good spirits he mounted his horse 
and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible 
and everything succeeds he sat motionless looking at the heights visible above the mist and 
his cold face wore that special look of confident self complacent happiness that one sees 
on the face of a boy happily in love the marshals stood behind him not 
venturing to distract his attention he looked now at the pratzen heights now at the 
sun floating up out of the mist when the sun had entirely emerged from the 
fog and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling if he had only awaited this 
to begin the drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a sign with 
it to the marshals and ordered the action to begin the marshals accompanied by adjutants 
galloped off in different directions and a few minutes later the chief forces of the 
french army moved rapidly toward those pratzen heights which were being more and more denuded 
by russian troops moving down the valley to their left chapter xv at eight kutúzov 
rode to pratzen at the head of the fourth column the one that was to 
take the place of and columns which had already gone down into the valley he 
greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them the order to march thereby 
indicating that he intended to lead that column himself when he had reached the village 
of pratzen he halted prince andrew was behind among the immense number forming the commander 
in suite he was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation though controlledly calm 
as a man is at the approach of a long awaited moment he was firmly 
convinced that this was the day of his toulon or his bridge of arcola how 
it would come about he did not know but he felt sure it would do 
so the locality and the position of our troops were known to him as far 
as they could be known to anyone in our army his own strategic plan which 
obviously could not now be carried out was forgotten now entering into plan prince andrew 
considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as might call for his rapidity of 
perception and decision to the left down below in the mist the musketry fire of 
unseen forces could be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight would concentrate 
we shall encounter difficulties and there thought he shall be sent with a brigade or 
division and there standard in hand i shall go forward and break whatever is in 
front of me he could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions 
seeing them he kept thinking may be the very standard with which i shall lead 
the army in the morning all that was left of the night mist on the 
heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew but in the valleys it still 
lay like a milk white sea nothing was visible in the valley to the left 
into which our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing above 
the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the vast orb of 
the sun in front far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist 
some wooded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probably was for something 
could be descried on the right the guards were entering the misty region with a 
sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets to the 
left beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea 
of mist in front and behind moved infantry the commander in chief was standing at 
the end of the village letting the troops pass by him that morning kutúzov seemed 
worn and irritable the infantry passing before him came to a halt without any command 
being given apparently obstructed by something in front order them to form into battalion columns 
and go round the village he said angrily to a general who had ridden up 
you understand your excellency my dear sir that you must not defile through narrow village 
streets when we are marching against the enemy intended to re form them beyond the 
village your excellency answered the general kutúzov laughed bitterly make a fine thing of it 
deploying in sight of the enemy very fine enemy is still far away your excellency 
according to the dispositions dispositions exclaimed kutúzov bitterly told you that kindly do as you 
are ordered sir dear fellow nesvítski whispered to prince andrew old man is as surly 
as a dog an austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his 
hat galloped up to kutúzov and asked in the name had the fourth column advanced 
into action kutúzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon prince 
andrew who was beside him seeing him malevolent and caustic expression softened as if admitting 
that what was being done was not his fault and still not answering the austrian 
adjutant he addressed bolkónski my dear fellow and see whether the third division has passed 
the village tell it to stop and await my orders hardly had prince andrew started 
than he stopped him ask whether sharpshooters have been posted he added are they doing 
what are they doing he murmured to himself still not replying to the austrian prince 
andrew galloped off to execute the order overtaking the battalions that continued to advance he 
stopped the third division and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in front 
of our columns the colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at 
the commander in order to throw out skirmishers he had felt perfectly sure that there 
were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least 
six miles away there was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren 
descent hidden by dense mist having given orders in the commander in name to rectify 
this omission prince andrew galloped back kutúzov still in the same place his stout body 
resting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age sat yawning wearily with closed 
eyes the troops were no longer moving but stood with the butts of their muskets 
on the ground right all right he said to prince andrew and turned to a 
general who watch in hand was saying it was time they started as all the 
left flank columns had already descended of time your excellency muttered kutúzov in the midst 
of a yawn of time he repeated just then at a distance behind kutúzov was 
heard the sound of regiments saluting and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole 
extended line of the advancing russian columns evidently the person they were greeting was riding 
quickly when the soldiers of the regiment in front of which kutúzov was standing began 
to shout he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown 
along the road from pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various 
uniforms two of them rode side by side in front at full gallop one in 
a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse the 
other who was in a white uniform rode a black one these were the two 
emperors followed by their suites kutúzov affecting the manners of an old soldier at the 
front gave the command and rode up to the emperors with a salute his whole 
appearance and manner were suddenly transformed he put on the air of a subordinate who 
obeys without reasoning with an affectation of respect which evidently struck alexander unpleasantly he rode 
up and saluted this unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face of 
the emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished after his 
illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of olmütz where bolkónski 
had seen him for the first time abroad but there was still the same bewitching 
combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes and on his delicate lips 
the same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth 
at the olmütz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed brighter and more 
energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping two miles and reining in his horse he 
sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of his suite young and animated as 
his own czartorýski novosíltsev prince volkónsky strógonov and the others all richly dressed gay young 
men on splendid well groomed fresh only slightly heated horses exchanging remarks and smiling had 
stopped behind the emperor the emperor francis a rosy long faced young man sat very 
erect on his handsome black horse looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner 
he beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some likely he is asking 
at what they started thought prince andrew watching his old acquaintance with a smile he 
could not repress as he recalled his reception at brünn in the suite were the 
picked young orderly officers of the guard and line regiments russian and austrian among them 
were grooms leading the beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths as when a window 
is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room so 
a whiff of youthfulness energy and confidence of success reached cheerless staff with the galloping 
advent of all these brilliant young men you beginning michael ilariónovich said the emperor alexander 
hurriedly to kutúzov glancing courteously at the same time at the emperor francis am waiting 
your majesty answered kutúzov bending forward respectfully the emperor frowning slightly bent his ear forward 
as if he had not quite heard your majesty repeated kutúzov prince andrew noted that 
upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word all the columns have formed up 
yet your majesty the tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged 
his rather round shoulders and glanced at novosíltsev who was near him as if complaining 
of kutúzov know michael ilariónovich we are not on the field where a parade does 
not begin till all the troops are assembled said the tsar with another glance at 
the emperor francis as if inviting him if not to join in at least to 
listen to what he was saying but the emperor francis continued to look about him 
and did not listen is just why i do not begin sire said kutúzov in 
a resounding voice apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard and again something 
in his face is just why i do not begin sire because we are not 
on parade and not on the field said he clearly and distinctly in the suite 
all exchanged rapid looks that expressed dissatisfaction and reproach though he may be he should 
not he certainly should not speak like that their glances seemed to say the tsar 
looked intently and observantly into eye waiting to hear whether he would say anything more 
but kutúzov with respectfully bowed head seemed also to be waiting the silence lasted for 
about a minute if you command it your majesty said kutúzov lifting his head and 
again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning but submissive general he touched his 
horse and having called milorádovich the commander of the column gave him the order to 
advance the troops again began to move and two battalions of the nóvgorod and one 
of the ápsheron regiment went forward past the emperor as this ápsheron battalion marched by 
the red faced milorádovich without his greatcoat with his orders on his breast and an 
enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners 
front and back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing salute reined in his horse 
before the emperor be with you general said the emperor foi sire nous ferons ce 
qui sera dans notre possibilité sire he answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the 
gentlemen of the suite by his poor french sire we shall do everything it is 
possible to do sire milorádovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little behind 
the emperor the ápsheron men excited by the presence passed in step before the emperors 
and their suites at a bold brisk pace shouted milorádovich in a loud self confident 
and cheery voice obviously so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect of 
battle and by the sight of the gallant ápsherons his comrades in time now passing 
so gallantly before the emperors that he forgot the presence not the first village had 
to take cried he to do our best shouted the soldiers the horse started at 
the sudden cry this horse that had carried the sovereign at reviews in russia bore 
him also here on the field of austerlitz enduring the heedless blows of his left 
foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done 
on the field not understanding the significance of the firing nor of the nearness of 
the emperor black cob nor of all that was being said thought and felt that 
day by its rider the emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers 
and made a remark to him pointing to the gallant ápsherons chapter xvi kutúzov accompanied 
by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers when he had gone 
less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a 
solitary deserted house that had probably once been an inn where two roads parted both 
of them led downhill and troops were marching along both the fog had begun to 
clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible about a mile and a half off 
on the opposite heights down below on the left the firing became more distinct kutúzov 
had stopped and was speaking to an austrian general prince andrew who was a little 
behind looking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass 
look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in the distance but down the 
hill before him the french the two generals and the adjutant took hold of the 
field glass trying to snatch it from one another the expression on all their faces 
suddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to be a mile and 
a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us the 
enemy no yes see it is for certain but how is that said different voices 
with the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right not more than 
five hundred paces from where kutúzov was standing a dense french column coming up to 
meet the ápsherons it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come thought 
prince andrew and striking his horse he rode up to kutúzov ápsherons must be stopped 
your excellency cried he but at that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all 
round firing was heard quite close at hand and a voice of naïve terror barely 
two steps from prince andrew shouted lost and at this as if at a command 
everyone began to run confused and ever increasing crowds were running back to where five 
minutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would it have been difficult 
to stop that crowd it was even impossible not to be carried back with it 
oneself bolkónski only tried not to lose touch with it and looked around bewildered and 
unable to grasp what was happening in front of him nesvítski with an angry face 
red and unlike himself was shouting to kutúzov that if he did not ride away 
at once he would certainly be taken prisoner kutúzov remained in the same place and 
without answering drew out a handkerchief blood was flowing from his cheek prince andrew forced 
his way to him are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of 
his lower jaw wound is not here it is there said kutúzov pressing the handkerchief 
to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers them he shouted and at 
the same moment probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them spurred his horse 
and rode to the right a fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and 
bore him back with it the troops were running in such a dense mass that 
once surrounded by them it was difficult to get out again one was shouting on 
why are you hindering us another in the same place turned round and fired in 
the air a third was striking the horse kutúzov himself rode having by a great 
effort got away to the left from that flood of men kutúzov with his suite 
diminished by more than half rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by having 
forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives prince andrew trying to keep near 
kutúzov saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that 
was still firing and frenchmen running toward it higher up stood some russian infantry neither 
moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd a mounted general 
separated himself from the infantry and approached kutúzov of suite only four remained they were 
all pale and exchanged looks in silence those wretches gasped kutúzov to the regimental commander 
pointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punish him for 
those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across suite like a flock of 
little birds the french had attacked the battery and seeing kutúzov were firing at him 
after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg several soldiers fell and a 
second lieutenant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands it swayed 
and fell but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing 
without orders oh oh groaned kutúzov despairingly and looked around he whispered his voice trembling 
from a consciousness of the feebleness of age he whispered pointing to the disordered battalion 
and at the enemy that but before he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears 
of shame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run to 
the standard lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a it is thought he 
seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently 
aimed at him several soldiers fell shouted prince andrew and scarcely able to hold up 
the heavy standard he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow 
him and really he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and then 
another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting and overtook him a sergeant of 
the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in 
prince hands but he was immediately killed prince andrew again seized the standard and dragging 
it by the staff ran on with the battalion in front he saw our artillerymen 
some of whom were fighting while others having abandoned their guns were running toward him 
he also saw french infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the 
guns round prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon 
he heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of 
him soldiers continually groaned and dropped but he did not look at them he looked 
only at what was going on in front of the battery he now saw clearly 
the figure of a red haired gunner with his shako knocked awry pulling one end 
of a mop while a french soldier tugged at the other he could distinctly see 
the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men who evidently did 
not realize what they were doing are they about thought prince andrew as he gazed 
at them the red haired gunner run away as he is unarmed why the frenchman 
stab him he will not get away before the frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs 
him and really another french soldier trailing his musket ran up to the struggling men 
and the fate of the red haired gunner who had triumphantly secured the mop and 
still did not realize what awaited him was about to be decided but prince andrew 
did not see how it ended it seemed to him as though one of the 
soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon 
it hurt a little but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him 
and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at this am i falling my 
legs are giving way thought he and fell on his back he opened his eyes 
hoping to see how the struggle of the frenchmen with the gunners ended whether the 
red haired gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured 
or saved but he saw nothing above him there was now nothing but the lofty 
sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with gray clouds gliding slowly across it quiet 
peaceful and solemn not at all as i ran thought prince as we ran shouting 
and fighting not at all as the gunner and the frenchman with frightened and angry 
faces struggled for the mop how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite 
sky how was it i did not see that lofty sky before and how happy 
i am to have found it at last yes all is vanity all falsehood except 
that infinite sky there is nothing nothing but that but even it does not exist 
there is nothing but quiet and peace thank god chapter xvii on our right flank 
commanded by bagratión at nine the battle had not yet begun not wishing to agree 
to demand to commence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himself prince bagratión 
proposed to dolgorúkov to send to inquire of the commander in chief bagratión knew that 
as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles even if the 
messenger were not killed which he very likely would be and found the commander in 
chief which would be very difficult he would not be able to get back before 
evening bagratión cast his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his suite and the boyish face 
of rostóv breathless with excitement and hope was the first to catch his eye he 
sent him if i should meet his majesty before i meet the commander in chief 
your excellency said rostóv with his hand to his cap can give the message to 
his majesty said dolgorúkov hurriedly interrupting bagratión on being relieved from picket duty rostóv had 
managed to get a few sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute with 
elasticity of movement faith in his good fortune and generally in that state of mind 
which makes everything seem possible pleasant and easy all his wishes were being fulfilled that 
morning there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part more 
than that he was orderly to the bravest general and still more he was going 
with a message to kutúzov perhaps even to the sovereign himself the morning was bright 
he had a good horse under him and his heart was full of joy and 
happiness on receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the 
line at first he rode along the line of troops which had not yet advanced 
into action but were standing motionless then he came to the region occupied by cavalry 
and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle having passed cavalry 
he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him the firing grew 
louder and louder in the fresh morning air were now heard not two or three 
musket shots at irregular intervals as before followed by one or two cannon shots but 
a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before pratzen interrupted 
by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated from 
one another but merged into a general roar he could see puffs of musketry smoke 
that seemed to chase one another down the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke rolling 
spreading and mingling with one another he could also by the gleam of bayonets visible 
through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with 
green caissons rostóv stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what 
was going on but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or 
make out anything of what was happening there in the smoke men of some sort 
were moving about in front and behind moved lines of troops but why whither and 
who they were it was impossible to make out these sights and sounds had no 
depressing or intimidating effect on him on the contrary they stimulated his energy and determination 
on go on give it them he mentally exclaimed at these sounds and again proceeded 
to gallop along the line penetrating farther and farther into the region where the army 
was already in action it will be there i know but all will be well 
thought rostóv after passing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the 
line the guards was already in action much the better i shall see it close 
he thought he was riding almost along the front line a handful of men came 
galloping toward him they were our uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning from the 
attack rostóv got out of their way involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding 
and galloped on is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many 
hundred yards after that before he saw to his left across the whole width of 
the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms mounted on black horses 
trotting straight toward him and across his path rostóv put his horse to full gallop 
to get out of the way of these men and he would have got clear 
had they continued at the same speed but they kept increasing their pace so that 
some of the horses were already galloping rostóv heard the thud of their hoofs and 
the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures and even their faces 
more and more distinctly they were our horse guards advancing to attack the french cavalry 
that was coming to meet them the horse guards were galloping but still holding in 
their horses rostóv could already see their faces and heard the command shouted by an 
officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed rostóv fearing to be crushed or 
swept into the attack on the french galloped along the front as hard as his 
horse could go but still was not in time to avoid them the last of 
the horse guards a huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrily on seeing rostóv before him with 
whom he would inevitably collide this guardsman would certainly have bowled rostóv and his bedouin 
over rostóv felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and horses 
had it not occurred to rostóv to flourish his whip before the eyes of the 
horse the heavy black horse sixteen hands high shied throwing back its ears but the 
pockmarked guardsman drove his huge spurs in violently and the horse flourishing its tail and 
extending its neck galloped on yet faster hardly had the horse guards passed rostóv before 
he heard them shout and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up 
with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets probably french he could see nothing more for 
immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything at that moment as 
the horse guards having passed him disappeared in the smoke rostóv hesitated whether to gallop 
after them or to go where he was sent this was the brilliant charge of 
the horse guards that amazed the french themselves rostóv was horrified to hear later that 
of all that mass of huge and handsome men of all those brilliant rich youths 
officers and cadets who had galloped past him on their thousand ruble horses only eighteen 
were left after the charge should i envy them my chance is not lost and 
maybe i shall see the emperor immediately thought rostóv and galloped on when he came 
level with the foot guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls 
were flying of which he was aware not so much because he heard their sound 
as because he saw uneasiness on the faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of 
the officers passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of foot guards he 
heard a voice calling him by name he answered not recognizing borís say been in 
the front line our regiment attacked said borís with the happy smile seen on the 
faces of young men who have been under fire for the first time rostóv stopped 
you he said how did it go drove them back said borís with animation growing 
talkative you imagine it and he began describing how the guards having taken up their 
position and seeing troops before them thought they were austrians and all at once discovered 
from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in the front 
line and had unexpectedly to go into action rostóv without hearing borís to the end 
spurred his horse are you off to asked borís a message to his majesty he 
is said borís thinking rostóv had said highness and pointing to the grand duke who 
with his high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in 
his helmet and horse jacket shouting something to a pale white uniformed austrian officer the 
grand duke and i want the commander in chief or the emperor said rostóv and 
was about to spur his horse count shouted berg who ran up from the other 
side as eager as borís i am wounded in my right and he showed his 
bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it i remained at the front i held 
my sword in my left hand count all our von been knights he said something 
more but rostóv did not wait to hear it and rode away having passed the 
guards and traversed an empty space rostóv to avoid again getting in front of the 
first line as he had done when the horse guards charged followed the line of 
reserves going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard 
suddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops 
where he could never have expected the enemy to be can it be he thought 
enemy in the rear of our army impossible and suddenly he was seized by a 
panic of fear for himself and for the issue of the whole battle be that 
what it may he reflected is no riding round it now i must look for 
the commander in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to 
perish with the rest the foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over rostóv was 
more and more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of 
pratzen which was full of troops of all kinds does it mean what is it 
whom are they firing at who is firing rostóv kept asking as he came up 
to russian and austrian soldiers running in confused crowds across his path devil knows killed 
everybody all up now he was told in russian german and czech by the crowd 
of fugitives who understood what was happening as little as he did the germans shouted 
one the devil take traitors henker diese russen muttered a german these russians several wounded 
men passed along the road and words of abuse screams and groans mingled in a 
general hubbub then the firing died down rostóv learned later that russian and austrian soldiers 
had been firing at one another god what does it all mean thought he here 
where at any moment the emperor may see them but no these must be only 
a handful of scoundrels it will soon be over it be that it be only 
to get past them quicker quicker the idea of defeat and flight could not enter 
head though he saw french cannon and french troops on the pratzen heights just where 
he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief he could not did 
not wish to believe that chapter xviii rostóv had been ordered to look for kutúzov 
and the emperor near the village of pratzen but neither they nor a single commanding 
officer were there only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds he urged on his 
already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds but the farther he went the 
more disorganized they were the highroad on which he had come out was thronged with 
calèches carriages of all sorts and russian and austrian soldiers of all arms some wounded 
and some not this whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence 
of cannon balls flying from the french batteries stationed on the pratzen heights is the 
emperor where is kutúzov rostóv kept asking everyone he could stop but got no answer 
from anyone at last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer 
brother all bolted long ago said the soldier laughing for some reason and shaking himself 
free having left that soldier who was evidently drunk rostóv stopped the horse of a 
batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him the man announced 
that the tsar had been driven in a carriage at full speed about an hour 
before along that very road and that he was dangerously wounded be said rostóv must 
have been someone else saw him myself replied the man with a self confident smile 
of derision ought to know the emperor by now after the times seen him in 
petersburg i saw him just as i see you there he sat in the carriage 
as pale as anything how they made the four black horses fly gracious me they 
did rattle past time i knew the imperial horses and ilyá iványch i think ilyá 
drives anyone except the tsar rostóv let go of the horse and was about to 
ride on when a wounded officer passing by addressed him is it you want he 
asked commander in chief he was killed by a cannon in the breast before our 
regiment another officer corrected him kutúzov asked rostóv kutúzov but his never mind there are 
not many left alive go that way to that village all the commanders are there 
said the officer pointing to the village of hosjeradek and he walked on rostóv rode 
on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going the 
emperor was wounded the battle lost it was impossible to doubt it now rostóv rode 
in the direction pointed out to him in which he saw turrets and a church 
what need to hurry what was he now to say to the tsar or to 
kutúzov even if they were alive and unwounded this road your honor that way you 
will be killed at once a soldier shouted to him kill you there what are 
you talking about said another is he to go that way is nearer rostóv considered 
and then went in the direction where they said he would be killed all the 
same now if the emperor is wounded am i to try to save myself he 
thought he rode on to the region where the greatest number of men had perished 
in fleeing from pratzen the french had not yet occupied that region and the uninjured 
and slightly left it long ago all about the field like heaps of manure on 
well kept plowland lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of 
acres the wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing 
screams and groans sometimes so it seemed to rostóv he put his horse to a 
trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men and he felt not for his life 
but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight 
of these unfortunates the french who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead 
and wounded where there was no one left to fire at on seeing an adjutant 
riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots the sensation of 
those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in mind into a 
single feeling of terror and pity for himself he remembered his last letter would she 
feel thought he she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed 
at me in the village of hosjeradek there were russian troops retiring from the field 
of battle who though still in some confusion were less disordered the french cannon did 
not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far away here everyone clearly saw and 
said that the battle was lost no one whom rostóv asked could tell him where 
the emperor or kutúzov was some said the report that the emperor was wounded was 
correct others that it was not and explained the false rumor that had spread by 
the fact that the carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the 
pale and terrified ober hofmarschal count tolstóy who had ridden out to the battlefield with 
others in the suite one officer told rostóv that he had seen someone from headquarters 
behind the village to the left and thither rostóv rode not hoping to find anyone 
but merely to ease his conscience when he had ridden about two miles and had 
passed the last of the russian troops he saw near a kitchen garden with a 
ditch round it two men on horseback facing the ditch one with a white plume 
in his hat seemed familiar to rostóv the other on a beautiful chestnut horse which 
rostóv fancied he had seen before rode up to the ditch struck his horse with 
his spurs and giving it the rein leaped lightly over only a little earth crumbled 
from the bank under the hind hoofs turning the horse sharply he again jumped the 
ditch and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes evidently suggesting that he should 
do the same the rider whose figure seemed familiar to rostóv and involuntarily riveted his 
attention made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture 
rostóv instantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch it be he alone in the midst 
of this empty field thought rostóv at that moment alexander turned his head and rostóv 
saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory the emperor was 
pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the charm the mildness of his 
features was all the greater rostóv was happy in the assurance that the rumors about 
the emperor being wounded were false he was happy to be seeing him he knew 
that he might and even ought to go straight to him and give the message 
dolgorúkov had ordered him to deliver but as a youth in love trembles is unnerved 
and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around 
for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longed for moment comes 
and he is alone with her so rostóv now that he had attained what he 
had longed for more than anything else in the world did not know how to 
approach the emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient 
unseemly and impossible to do so it is as if i were glad of a 
chance to take advantage of his being alone and despondent a strange face may seem 
unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can i say 
to him now when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the 
mere sight of him not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the emperor that 
he had composed in his imagination could he now recall those speeches were intended for 
quite other conditions they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment 
of victory and triumph generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had 
thanked him for heroic deeds and while dying he expressed the love his actions had 
proved how can i ask the emperor for his instructions for the right flank now 
that it is nearly four and the battle is lost no certainly i must not 
approach him i must not intrude on his reflections better die a thousand times than 
risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him rostóv decided and sorrowfully and 
with a heart full despair he rode away continually looking back at the tsar who 
still remained in the same attitude of indecision while rostóv was thus arguing with himself 
and riding sadly away captain von toll chanced to ride to the same spot and 
seeing the emperor at once rode up to him offered his services and assisted him 
to cross the ditch on foot the emperor wishing to rest and feeling unwell sat 
down under an apple tree and von toll remained beside him rostóv from a distance 
saw with envy and remorse how von toll spoke long and warmly to the emperor 
and how the emperor evidently weeping covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von 
hand i might have been in his place thought rostóv and hardly restraining his tears 
of pity for the emperor he rode on in utter despair not knowing where to 
or why he was now riding his despair was all the greater from feeling that 
his own weakness was the cause of his grief he might not only might but 
should have gone up to the sovereign it was a unique chance to show his 
devotion to the emperor and he had not made use of it have i done 
thought he and he turned round and galloped back to the place where he had 
seen the emperor but there was no one beyond the ditch now only some carts 
and carriages were passing by from one of the drivers he learned that staff were 
not far off in the village the vehicles were going to rostóv followed them in 
front of him walked groom leading horses in horsecloths then came a cart and behind 
that walked an old bandy legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat 
i say tit said the groom answered the old man absent mindedly tit thresh a 
bit you fool said the old man spitting angrily some time passed in silence and 
then the same joke was repeated before five in the evening the battle had been 
lost at all points more than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of 
the french przebyszéwski and his corps had laid down their arms other columns after losing 
half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses the remains of and mingled forces 
were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of augesd 
after five it was only at the augesd dam that a hot cannonade delivered by 
the french alone was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes 
of the pratzen heights directed at our retreating forces in the rearguard dokhtúrov and others 
rallying some battalions kept up a musketry fire at the french cavalry that was pursuing 
our troops it was growing dusk on the narrow augesd dam where for so many 
years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling 
while his grandson with shirt sleeves rolled up handled the floundering silvery fish in the 
watering can on that dam over which for so many years moravians in shaggy caps 
and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two horse carts loaded with wheat and had 
returned dusty with flour whitening their that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon 
under the hoofs and between the wagon wheels men disfigured by fear of death now 
crowded together crushing one another dying stepping over the dying and killing one another only 
to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way every 
ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around or a shell burst in 
the midst of that dense throng killing some and splashing with blood those near them 
an in the arm and on foot with the regimental commander on horseback and some 
ten men of his company represented all that was left of that whole regiment impelled 
by the crowd they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and 
jammed in on all sides had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under 
a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out a cannon ball killed someone behind 
them another fell in front and splashed dólokhov with blood the crowd pushing forward desperately 
squeezed together moved a few steps and again stopped on a hundred yards and we 
are certainly saved remain here another two minutes and it is certain death thought each 
one dólokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the 
edge of the dam throwing two soldiers off their feet and ran onto the slippery 
ice that covered the millpool this way he shouted jumping over the ice which creaked 
under him this way he shouted to those with the gun bears the ice bore 
him but it swayed and creaked and it was plain that it would give way 
not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon even under his weight 
alone the men looked at him and pressed to the bank hesitating to step onto 
the ice the general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand 
and opened his mouth to address dólokhov suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above 
the crowd that everyone ducked it flopped into something moist and the general fell from 
his horse in a pool of blood nobody gave him a look or thought of 
raising him onto the ice over the ice go on turn you hear go on 
innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general the men themselves not 
knowing what or why they were shouting one of the hindmost guns that was going 
onto the dam turned off onto the ice crowds of soldiers from the dam began 
running onto the frozen pond the ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers 
and one leg slipped into the water he tried to right himself but fell in 
up to his waist the nearest soldiers shrank back the gun driver stopped his horse 
but from behind still came the shouts the ice why do you stop go on 
go on and cries of horror were heard in the crowd the soldiers near the 
gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and move on 
the horses moved off the bank the ice that had held under those on foot 
collapsed in a great mass and some forty men who were on it dashed some 
forward and some back drowning one another still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle 
and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the 
crowd that covered the dam the pond and the bank chapter xix on the pratzen 
heights where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand lay prince andrew bolkónski 
bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle piteous and childlike moan toward evening he ceased 
moaning and became quite still he did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted suddenly 
he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in 
his head is it that lofty sky that i did not know till now but 
saw today was his first thought i did not know this suffering either he thought 
i did not know anything anything at all till now but where am i he 
listened and heard the sound of approaching horses and voices speaking french he opened his 
eyes above him again was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and 
were floating still higher and between them gleamed blue infinity he did not turn his 
head and did not see those who judging by the sound of hoofs and voices 
had ridden up and stopped near him it was napoleon accompanied by two aides de 
camp bonaparte riding over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries firing 
at the augesd dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left on the 
field men remarked napoleon looking at a dead russian grenadier who with his face buried 
in the ground and a blackened nape lay on his stomach with an already stiffened 
arm flung wide ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted your majesty said an 
adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at augesd some brought from 
the reserve said napoleon and having gone on a few steps he stopped before prince 
andrew who lay on his back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him 
the flag had already been taken by the french as a trophy a fine death 
said napoleon as he gazed at bolkónski prince andrew understood that this was said of 
him and that it was napoleon who said it he heard the speaker addressed as 
sire but he heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a 
fly not only did they not interest him but he took no notice of them 
and at once forgot them his head was burning he felt himself bleeding to death 
and he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky he knew it was 
at that moment napoleon seemed to him such a small insignificant creature compared with what 
was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over 
it at that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him 
or what was said of him he was only glad that people were standing near 
him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life 
which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it 
so differently he collected all his strength to stir and utter a sound he feebly 
moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groan which aroused his own pity he 
is alive said napoleon this young man up and carry him to the dressing station 
having said this napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes who hat in hand rode 
up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victory prince andrew remembered nothing 
more he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the 
jolting while being moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing station he 
did not regain consciousness till late in the day when with other wounded and captured 
russian officers he was carried to the hospital during this transfer he felt a little 
stronger and was able to look about him and even speak the first words he 
heard on coming to his senses were those of a french convoy officer who said 
rapidly must halt here the emperor will pass here immediately it will please him to 
see these gentlemen prisoners are so many prisoners today nearly the whole russian army that 
he is probably tired of them said another officer the same they say this one 
is the commander of all the emperor guards said the first one indicating a russian 
officer in the white uniform of the horse guards bolkónski recognized prince repnín whom he 
had met in petersburg society beside him stood a lad of nineteen also a wounded 
officer of the horse guards bonaparte having come up at a gallop stopped his horse 
is the senior he asked on seeing the prisoners they named the colonel prince repnín 
are the commander of the emperor regiment of horse guards asked napoleon commanded a squadron 
replied repnín regiment fulfilled its duty honorably said napoleon praise of a great commander is 
a highest reward said repnín bestow it with pleasure said napoleon who is that young 
man beside you prince repnín named lieutenant sukhtélen after looking at him napoleon smiled very 
young to come to meddle with us is no hindrance to courage muttered sukhtélen in 
a failing voice splendid reply said napoleon man you will go far prince andrew who 
had also been brought forward before the eyes to complete the show of prisoners could 
not fail to attract his attention napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and 
addressing him again used the epithet that was connected in his memory with prince andrew 
and you young man said he do you feel mon brave though five minutes before 
prince andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were 
carrying him now with his eyes fixed straight on napoleon he was silent so insignificant 
at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so mean did 
his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear compared to the 
lofty equitable and kindly sky which he had seen and understood that he could not 
answer him everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn 
train of thought that weakness from loss of blood suffering and the nearness of death 
aroused in him looking into eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness the 
unimportance of life which no one could understand and the still greater unimportance of death 
the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain the emperor without waiting 
for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went 
these gentlemen attended to and taken to my bivouac let my doctor larrey examine their 
wounds au revoir prince repnín and he spurred his horse and galloped away his face 
shone with self satisfaction and pleasure the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed 
and taken the little gold icon princess mary had hung round her neck but seeing 
the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened to return the holy image 
prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the little 
icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform would 
be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his 
neck with such emotion and reverence would be good if everything were as clear and 
simple as it seems to mary how good it would be to know where to 
seek for help in this life and what to expect after it beyond the grave 
how happy and calm i should be if i could now say have mercy on 
me but to whom should i say that either to a power indefinable incomprehensible which 
i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express in great all or 
nothing said he to himself to that god who has been sewn into this amulet 
by mary there is nothing certain nothing at all except the unimportance of everything i 
understand and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all important the stretchers moved on at 
every jolt he again felt unendurable pain his feverishness increased and he grew delirious visions 
of his father wife sister and future son and the tenderness he had felt the 
night before the battle the figure of the insignificant little napoleon and above all this 
the lofty sky formed the chief subjects of his delirious fancies the quiet home life 
and peaceful happiness of bald hills presented itself to him he was already enjoying that 
happiness when that little napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight 
at the misery of others and doubts and torments had followed and only the heavens 
promised peace toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness 
of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of doctor larrey was much more likely 
to end in death than in convalescence is a nervous bilious subject said larrey will 
not recover and prince andrew with others fatally wounded was left to the care of 
the inhabitants of the district book four 1806 chapter i early in the year 1806 
nicholas rostóv returned home on leave denísov was going home to vorónezh and rostóv persuaded 
him to travel with him as far as moscow and to stay with him there 
meeting a comrade at the last post station but one before moscow denísov had drunk 
three bottles of wine with him and despite the jolting ruts across the snow covered 
road did not once wake up on the way to moscow but lay at the 
bottom of the sleigh beside rostóv who grew more and more impatient the nearer they 
got to moscow much longer how much longer oh these insufferable streets shops signboards street 
lamps and sleighs thought rostóv when their leave permits had been passed at the town 
gate and they had entered moscow here asleep he added leaning forward with his whole 
body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the sleigh 
denísov gave no answer the corner at the crossroads where the cabman zakhár has his 
stand and zakhár himself and still the same horse and the little shop where we 
used to buy gingerbread you hurry up now then house is it asked the driver 
that one right at the end the big one you see our house said rostóv 
course our house denísov denísov almost there denísov raised his head coughed and made no 
answer said rostóv to his valet on the box lights are in our house they 
sir and a light in your study not gone to bed yet what do you 
think mind now forget to put out my new coat added rostóv fingering his new 
mustache then get on he shouted to the driver wake up váska he went on 
turning to denísov whose head was again nodding get on you shall have three rubles 
for on rostóv shouted when the sleigh was only three houses from his door it 
seemed to him the horses were not moving at all at last the sleigh bore 
to the right drew up at an entrance and rostóv saw overhead the old familiar 
cornice with a bit of plaster broken off the porch and the post by the 
side of the pavement he sprang out before the sleigh stopped and ran into the 
hall the house stood cold and silent as if quite regardless of who had come 
to it there was no one in the hall god is everyone all right he 
thought stopping for a moment with a sinking heart and then immediately starting to run 
along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar staircase the well known 
old door handle which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned turned 
as loosely as ever a solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom old michael was 
asleep on the chest prokófy the footman who was so strong that he could lift 
the back of the carriage from behind sat plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges he 
looked up at the opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to 
one of delighted amazement heavens the young count he cried recognizing his young master it 
be my treasure and prokófy trembling with excitement rushed toward the drawing room door probably 
in order to announce him but changing his mind came back and stooped to kiss 
the young shoulder well asked rostóv drawing away his arm god be thanked yes just 
finished supper let me have a look at you your excellency everything quite all right 
lord be thanked yes rostóv who had completely forgotten denísov not wishing anyone to forestall 
him threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the large dark ballroom 
all was the same there were the same old card tables and the same chandelier 
with a cover over it but someone had already seen the young master and before 
he had reached the drawing room something flew out from a side door like a 
tornado and began hugging and kissing him another and yet another creature of the same 
kind sprang from a second door and a third more hugging more kissing more outcries 
and tears of joy he could not distinguish which was papa which natásha and which 
pétya everyone shouted talked and kissed him at the same time only his mother was 
not there he noticed that i did not know nicholas my darling he is our 
own kólya dear fellow how he has changed where are the candles tea nicholas me 
kiss me and me sónya natásha pétya anna mikháylovna véra and the old count were 
all hugging him and the serfs men and maids flocked into the room exclaiming and 
oh ing and ah ing pétya clinging to his legs kept shouting me too natásha 
after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face with kisses holding 
him tight by the skirt of his coat sprang away and pranced up and down 
in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly all around were loving eyes glistening 
with tears of joy and all around were lips seeking a kiss sónya too all 
rosy red clung to his arm and radiant with bliss looked eagerly toward his eyes 
waiting for the look for which she longed sónya now was sixteen and she was 
very pretty especially at this moment of happy rapturous excitement she gazed at him not 
taking her eyes off him and smiling and holding her breath he gave her a 
grateful look but was still expectant and looking for someone the old countess had not 
yet come but now steps were heard at the door steps so rapid that they 
could hardly be his yet it was she dressed in a new gown which he 
did not know made since he had left all the others let him go and 
he ran to her when they met she fell on his breast sobbing she could 
not lift her face but only pressed it to the cold braiding of his jacket 
denísov who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone stood there and wiped his 
eyes at the sight denísov your friend he said introducing himself to the count who 
was looking inquiringly at him are most welcome i know i know said the count 
kissing and embracing denísov wrote us natásha véra look here is denísov the same happy 
rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of denísov denísov screamed natásha beside herself with 
rapture springing to him putting her arms round him and kissing him this escapade made 
everybody feel confused denísov blushed too but smiled and taking hand kissed it denísov was 
shown to the room prepared for him and the rostóvs all gathered round nicholas in 
the sitting room the old countess not letting go of his hand and kissing it 
every moment sat beside him the rest crowding round him watched every movement word or 
look of his never taking their blissfully adoring eyes off him his brother and sisters 
struggled for the places nearest to him and disputed with one another who should bring 
him his tea handkerchief and pipe rostóv was very happy in the love they showed 
him but the first moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy 
seemed insufficient and he kept expecting something more more and yet more next morning after 
the fatigues of their journey the travelers slept till ten in the room next to 
their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers satchels sabretaches open portmanteaus and dirty boots 
two freshly cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall the servants 
were bringing in jugs and basins hot water for shaving and their well brushed clothes 
there was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco pipe came vasíli husky voice 
get up rostóv rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together raised his disheveled head from 
the hot pillow is it late nearly ten answered voice a rustle of starched petticoats 
and the whispering and laughter of voices came from the adjoining room the door was 
opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue of ribbons black hair 
and merry faces it was natásha sónya and pétya who had come to see whether 
they were getting up get up voice was again heard at the door meanwhile pétya 
having found and seized the sabers in the outer room with the delight boys feel 
at the sight of a military elder brother and forgetting that it was unbecoming for 
the girls to see men undressed opened the bedroom door this your saber he shouted 
the girls sprang aside denísov hid his hairy legs under the blanket looking with a 
scared face at his comrade for help the door having let pétya in closed again 
a sound of laughter came from behind it come out in your dressing gown said 
voice this your saber asked pétya is it yours he said addressing the black mustached 
denísov with servile deference rostóv hurriedly put something on his feet drew on his dressing 
gown and went out natásha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting 
her foot into the other sónya when he came in was twirling round and was 
about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down they were dressed alike 
in new pale blue frocks and were both fresh rosy and bright sónya ran away 
but natásha taking her arm led him into the sitting room where they began talking 
they hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand 
little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves natásha laughed at every word he 
said or that she said herself not because what they were saying was amusing but 
because she felt happy and was unable to control her joy which expressed itself by 
laughter how nice how splendid she said to everything rostóv felt that under the influence 
of the warm rays of love that childlike smile which had not once appeared on 
his face since he left home now for the first time after eighteen months again 
brightened his soul and his face but listen she said you are quite a man 
you awfully glad my brother she touched his mustache want to know what you men 
are like are you the same as we no did sónya run away asked rostóv 
yes a whole long story how are you going to speak to or you may 
happen said rostóv call her you please tell you all about it some other time 
no tell you now you know my dearest friend such a friend that i burned 
my arm for her sake look here she pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed 
him a red scar on her long slender delicate arm high above the elbow on 
that part that is covered even by a ball dress burned this to prove my 
love for her i just heated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there 
sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms in what used to 
be his old schoolroom and looking into wildly bright eyes rostóv re entered that world 
of home and childhood which had no meaning for anyone else but gave him some 
of the best joys of his life and the burning of an arm with a 
ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him senseless he understood and 
was not surprised at it and is that all he asked are such friends such 
friends all that ruler business was just nonsense but we are friends forever she if 
she loves anyone does it for life but i understand that i forget quickly what 
then she loves me and you like that natásha suddenly flushed you remember before you 
went away well she says you are to forget all that she says shall love 
him always but let him be free that lovely and noble yes very noble it 
asked natásha so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she was now 
saying she had talked of before with tears rostóv became thoughtful never go back on 
my word he said sónya is so charming that only a fool would renounce such 
happiness no cried natásha and i have already talked it over we knew say so 
but it do because you see if you say you consider yourself bound by your 
will seem as if she had not meant it seriously it makes it as if 
you were marrying her because you must and that do at all rostóv saw that 
it had been well considered by them sónya had already struck him by her beauty 
on the preceding day today when he had caught a glimpse of her she seemed 
still more lovely she was a charming girl of sixteen evidently passionately in love with 
him he did not doubt that for an instant why should he not love her 
now and even marry her rostóv thought but just now there were so many other 
pleasures and interests before him they have taken a wise decision he thought must remain 
free then excellent said he talk it over later on oh how glad i am 
to have you and are you still true to borís he continued what nonsense cried 
natásha laughing think about him or anyone else and i want anything of the kind 
me then what are you up to now repeated natásha and a happy smile lit 
up her face you seen duport seen famous dancer well then you understand what up 
to curving her arms natásha held out her skirts as dancers do ran back a 
few steps turned cut a caper brought her little feet sharply together and made some 
steps on the very tips of her toes standing see she said but could not 
maintain herself on her toes any longer what up to never marry anyone but will 
be a dancer only tell anyone rostóv laughed so loud and merrily that denísov in 
his bedroom felt envious and natásha could not help joining in but you think nice 
she kept repeating and so you no longer wish to marry borís natásha flared up 
want to marry anyone and tell him so when i see him me said rostóv 
all rubbish natásha chattered on is denísov nice she asked indeed well then good by 
go and dress is he very terrible denísov terrible asked nicholas váska is a splendid 
fellow call him váska funny and is he very nice then be quick all have 
breakfast together and natásha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe like a 
ballet dancer but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile when rostóv met 
sónya in the drawing room he reddened he did not know how to behave with 
her the evening before in the first happy moment of meeting they had kissed each 
other but today they felt it could not be done he felt that everybody including 
his mother and sisters was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he 
would behave with her he kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but 
as but their eyes met and said thou and exchanged tender kisses her looks asked 
him to forgive her for having dared by intermediacy to remind him of his promise 
and then thanked him for his love his looks thanked her for offering him his 
freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love 
her for that would be impossible strange it is said véra selecting a moment when 
all were silent sónya and nicholas now say you to one another and meet like 
strangers remark was correct as her remarks always were but like most of her observations 
it made everyone feel uncomfortable not only sónya nicholas and natásha but even the old 
countess this love affair which might hinder nicholas from making a brilliant like a girl 
denísov to surprise appeared in the drawing room with pomaded hair perfumed and in a 
new uniform looking just as smart as he made himself when going into battle and 
he was more amiable to the ladies and gentlemen than rostóv had ever expected to 
see him chapter ii on his return to moscow from the army nicholas rostóv was 
welcomed by his home circle as the best of sons a hero and their darling 
nikólenka by his relations as a charming attractive and polite young man by his acquaintances 
as a handsome lieutenant of hussars a good dancer and one of the best matches 
in the city the rostóvs knew everybody in moscow the old count had money enough 
that year as all his estates had been remortgaged and so nicholas acquiring a trotter 
of his own very stylish riding breeches of the latest cut such as no one 
else yet had in moscow and boots of the latest fashion with extremely pointed toes 
and small silver spurs passed his time very gaily after a short period of adapting 
himself to the old conditions of life nicholas found it very pleasant to be at 
home again he felt that he had grown up and matured very much his despair 
at failing in a scripture examination his borrowing money from gavríl to pay a sleigh 
driver his kissing sónya on the now recalled all this as childishness he had left 
immeasurably behind now he was a lieutenant of hussars in a jacket laced with silver 
and wearing the cross of st george awarded to soldiers for bravery in action and 
in the company of well known elderly and respected racing men was training a trotter 
of his own for a race he knew a lady on one of the boulevards 
whom he visited of an evening he led the mazurka at the ball talked about 
the war with field marshal kámenski visited the english club and was on intimate terms 
with a colonel of forty to whom denísov had introduced him his passion for the 
emperor had cooled somewhat in moscow but still as he did not see him and 
had no opportunity of seeing him he often spoke about him and about his love 
for him letting it be understood that he had not told all and that there 
was something in his feelings for the emperor not everyone could understand and with his 
whole soul he shared the adoration then common in moscow for the emperor who was 
spoken of as the incarnate during short stay in moscow before rejoining the army he 
did not draw closer to sónya but rather drifted away from her she was very 
pretty and sweet and evidently deeply in love with him but he was at the 
period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time 
for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes 
his freedom which he needs for so many other things when he thought of sónya 
during this stay in moscow he said to himself there will be and there are 
many more such girls somewhere whom i do not yet know there will be time 
enough to think about love when i want to but now i have no time 
besides it seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to his 
manhood he went to balls and into society with an affectation of doing so against 
his will the races the english club sprees with denísov and visits to a certain 
was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar at the beginning 
of march old count ilyá rostóv was very busy arranging a dinner in honor of 
prince bagratión at the english club the count walked up and down the hall in 
his dressing gown giving orders to the club steward and to the famous feoktíst the 
head cook about asparagus fresh cucumbers strawberries veal and fish for this dinner the count 
had been a member and on the committee of the club from the day it 
was founded to him the club entrusted the arrangement of the festival in honor of 
bagratión for few men knew so well how to arrange a feast on an open 
handed hospitable scale and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to 
make up out of their own resources what might be needed for the success of 
the fete the club cook and the steward listened to the orders with pleased faces 
for they knew that under no other management could they so easily extract a good 
profit for themselves from a dinner costing several thousand rubles then mind and have comb 
in the turtle soup you know we have three cold dishes then asked the cook 
the count considered have three the mayonnaise one said he bending down a finger am 
i to order those large sterlets asked the steward it be helped if they take 
less ah dear me i was forgetting we must have another entrée ah goodness gracious 
he clutched at his head is going to get me the flowers dmítri eh dmítri 
gallop off to our moscow estate he said to the factotum who appeared at his 
call off and tell maksím the gardener to set the serfs to work say that 
everything out of the hothouses must be brought here well wrapped up in felt i 
must have two hundred pots here on friday having given several more orders he was 
about to go to his to have a rest but remembering something else of importance 
he returned again called back the cook and the club steward and again began giving 
orders a light footstep and the clinking of spurs were heard at the door and 
the young count handsome rosy with a dark little mustache evidently rested and made sleeker 
by his easy life in moscow entered the room my boy my in a whirl 
said the old man with a smile as if he felt a little confused before 
his son if you would only help a bit i must have singers too i 
shall have my own orchestra but we get the gypsy singers as well you military 
men like that sort of thing papa i believe prince bagratión worried himself less before 
the battle of schön grabern than you do now said his son with a smile 
the old count pretended to be angry you talk but try it yourself and the 
count turned to the cook who with a shrewd and respectful expression looked observantly and 
sympathetically at the father and son have the young people come to nowadays eh feoktíst 
said he at us old fellows so your excellency all they have to do is 
to eat a good dinner but providing it and serving it all up not their 
business it it exclaimed the count and gaily seizing his son by both hands he 
cried got you so take the sleigh and pair at once and go to and 
tell him ilyá has sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples we get 
them from anyone else not there himself so have to go in and ask the 
princesses and from there go on to the coachman ipátka look up the gypsy ilyúshka 
the one who danced at count you remember in a white cossack coat and bring 
him along to me am i to bring the gypsy girls along with him asked 
nicholas laughing dear at that moment with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike preoccupied yet 
meekly christian look which never left her face anna mikháylovna entered the hall though she 
came upon the count in his dressing gown every day he invariably became confused and 
begged her to excuse his costume matter at all my dear count she said meekly 
closing her eyes go to myself pierre has arrived and now we shall get anything 
we want from his hothouses i have to see him in any case he has 
forwarded me a letter from borís thank god borís is now on the staff the 
count was delighted at anna taking upon herself one of his commissions and ordered the 
small closed carriage for her bezúkhov to come put his name down is his wife 
with him he asked anna mikháylovna turned up her eyes and profound sadness was depicted 
on her face my dear friend he is very unfortunate she said what we hear 
is true it is dreadful how little we dreamed of such a thing when we 
were rejoicing at his happiness and such a lofty angelic soul as young bezúkhov yes 
i pity him from my heart and shall try to give him what consolation i 
can what is the matter asked both the young and old rostóv anna mikháylovna sighed 
deeply mary son she said in a mysterious whisper compromised her completely they say pierre 
took him up invited him to his house in petersburg and now she has come 
here and that daredevil after her said anna mikháylovna wishing to show her sympathy for 
pierre but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her sympathy for the as 
she called dólokhov say pierre is quite broken by his misfortune dear but still tell 
him to come to the will all blow over it will be a tremendous banquet 
next day the third of march soon after one two hundred and fifty members of 
the english club and fifty guests were awaiting the guest of honor and hero of 
the austrian campaign prince bagratión to dinner on the first arrival of the news of 
the battle of austerlitz moscow had been bewildered at that time the russians were so 
used to victories that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe 
it while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an event in the english 
club where all who were distinguished important and well informed foregathered when the news began 
to arrive in december nothing was said about the war and the last battle as 
though all were in a conspiracy of silence the men who set the tone in 
rostopchín prince yúri dolgorúkov valúev count markóv and prince not show themselves at the club 
but met in private houses in intimate circles and the moscovites who took their opinions 
from rostóv among for a while without any definite opinion on the subject of the 
war and without leaders the moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to discuss 
the bad news was difficult and so it was best to be silent but after 
a while just as a jury comes out of its room the bigwigs who guided 
the opinion reappeared and everybody began speaking clearly and definitely reasons were found for the 
incredible unheard of and impossible event of a russian defeat everything became clear and in 
all corners of moscow the same things began to be said these reasons were the 
treachery of the austrians a defective commissariat the treachery of the pole przebyszéwski and of 
the frenchman langeron incapacity and it was whispered the youth and inexperience of the sovereign 
who had trusted worthless and insignificant people but the army the russian army everyone declared 
was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor the soldiers officers and generals were heroes 
but the hero of heroes was prince bagratión distinguished by his schön grabern affair and 
by the retreat from austerlitz where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had 
all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own what also 
conduced to being selected as hero was the fact that he had no connections in 
the city and was a stranger there in his person honor was shown to a 
simple fighting russian soldier without connections and intrigues and to one who was associated by 
memories of the italian campaign with the name of suvórov moreover paying such honor to 
bagratión was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of kutúzov there been no 
bagratión it would have been necessary to invent him said the wit shinshín parodying the 
words of voltaire kutúzov no one spoke of except some who abused him in whispers 
calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr all moscow repeated prince saying you 
go on modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay suggesting consolation for our 
defeat by the memory of former victories and the words of rostopchín that french soldiers 
have to be incited to battle by highfalutin words and germans by logical arguments to 
show them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance but that 
russian soldiers only need to be restrained and held back on all sides new and 
fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our officers and men 
at austerlitz one had saved a standard another had killed five frenchmen a third had 
loaded five cannon singlehanded berg was mentioned by those who did not know him as 
having when wounded in the right hand taken his sword in the left and gone 
forward of bolkónski nothing was said and only those who knew him intimately regretted that 
he had died so young leaving a pregnant wife with his eccentric father chapter iii 
on that third of march all the rooms in the english club were filled with 
a hum of conversation like the hum of bees swarming in springtime the members and 
guests of the club wandered hither and thither sat stood met and separated some in 
uniform and some in evening dress and a few here and there with powdered hair 
and in russian kaftáns powdered footmen in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings stood 
at every door anxiously noting every movement in order to offer their services most of 
those present were elderly respected men with broad self confident faces fat fingers and resolute 
gestures and voices this class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places and 
met in certain habitual groups a minority of those present were casual young men among 
whom were denísov rostóv and was now again an officer in the semënov regiment the 
faces of these young people especially those who were military men bore that expression of 
condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older generation are prepared 
to respect and honor you but all the same remember that the future belongs to 
us nesvítski was there as an old member of the club pierre who at his 
command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles went about the rooms fashionably 
dressed but looking sad and dull here as elsewhere he was surrounded by an atmosphere 
of subservience to his wealth and being in the habit of lording it over these 
people he treated them with absent minded contempt by his age he should have belonged 
to the younger men but by his wealth and connections he belonged to the groups 
of old and honored guests and so he went from one group to another some 
of the most important old men were the center of groups which even strangers approached 
respectfully to hear the voices of well known men the largest circles formed round count 
rostopchín valúev and narýshkin rostopchín was describing how the russians had been overwhelmed by flying 
austrians and had had to force their way through them with bayonets valúev was confidentially 
telling that uvárov had been sent from petersburg to ascertain what moscow was thinking about 
austerlitz in the third circle narýshkin was speaking of the meeting of the austrian council 
of war at which suvórov crowed like a cock in reply to the nonsense talked 
by the austrian generals shinshín standing close by tried to make a joke saying that 
kutúzov had evidently failed to learn from suvórov even so simple a thing as the 
art of crowing like a cock but the elder members glanced severely at the wit 
making him feel that in that place and on that day it was improper to 
speak so of kutúzov count ilyá rostóv hurried and preoccupied went about in his soft 
boots between the dining and drawing rooms hastily greeting the important and unimportant all of 
whom he knew as if they were all equals while his eyes occasionally sought out 
his fine well set up young son resting on him and winking joyfully at him 
young rostóv stood at a window with dólokhov whose acquaintance he had lately made and 
highly valued the old count came up to them and pressed hand come and visit 
us you know my brave boy been together out there both playing the hero ah 
vasíli ignátovich how do old fellow he said turning to an old man who was 
passing but before he had finished his greeting there was a general stir and a 
footman who had run in announced with a frightened face arrived bells rang the stewards 
rushed forward rye shaken together in a guests who had been scattered about in different 
rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the 
ballroom bagratión appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword which in 
accord with the club custom he had given up to the hall porter he had 
no lambskin cap on his head nor had he a loaded whip over his shoulder 
as when rostóv had seen him on the eve of the battle of austerlitz but 
wore a tight new uniform with russian and foreign orders and the star of st 
george on his left breast evidently just before coming to the dinner he had had 
his hair and whiskers trimmed which changed his appearance for the worse there was something 
naïvely festive in his air which in conjunction with his firm and virile features gave 
him a rather comical expression bekleshëv and theodore uvárov who had arrived with him paused 
at the doorway to allow him as the guest of honor to enter first bagratión 
was embarrassed not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy and this caused some delay 
at the doors but after all he did at last enter first he walked shyly 
and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room not knowing what to do 
with his hands he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire 
as he had done at the head of the kursk regiment at schön he would 
have found that easier the committeemen met him at the first door and expressing their 
delight at seeing such a highly honored guest took possession of him as it were 
without waiting for his reply surrounded him and led him to the drawing room it 
was at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of members 
and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at bagratión over 
each shoulders as if he were some rare animal count ilyá rostóv laughing and repeating 
the words way dear boy make way make way pushed through the crowd more energetically 
than anyone led the guests into the drawing room and seated them on the center 
sofa the bigwigs the most respected members of the club beset the new arrivals count 
ilyá again thrusting his way through the crowd went out of the drawing room and 
reappeared a minute later with another committeeman carrying a large silver salver which he presented 
to prince bagratión on the salver lay some verses composed and printed in the honor 
bagratión on seeing the salver glanced around in dismay as though seeking help but all 
eyes demanded that he should submit feeling himself in their power he resolutely took the 
salver with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented 
it to him someone obligingly took the dish from bagratión or he would it seemed 
have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it and drew 
his attention to the verses i will read them then bagratión seemed to say and 
fixing his weary eyes on the paper began to read them with a fixed and 
serious expression but the author himself took the verses and began reading them aloud bagratión 
bowed his head and listened bring glory then to reign and on the throne our 
titus shield a dreaded foe be thou kindhearted as a man a rhipheus at home 
a caesar in the field fortunate napoleon knows by experience now bagratión and dare not 
herculean russians trouble but before he had finished reading a stentorian major domo announced that 
dinner was ready the door opened and from the dining room came the resounding strains 
of the polonaise joyful thunder waken triumph valiant russians now and count rostóv glancing angrily 
at the author who went on reading his verses bowed to bagratión everyone rose feeling 
that dinner was more important than verses and bagratión again preceding all the rest went 
in to dinner he was seated in the place of honor between two and was 
a significant allusion to the name of the sovereign three hundred persons took their seats 
in the dining room according to their rank and importance the more important nearer to 
the honored guest as naturally as water flows deepest where the land lies lowest just 
before dinner count ilyá rostóv presented his son to bagratión who recognized him and said 
a few words to him disjointed and awkward as were all the words he spoke 
that day and count ilyá looked joyfully and proudly around while bagratión spoke to his 
son nicholas rostóv with denísov and his new acquaintance dólokhov sat almost at the middle 
of the table facing them sat pierre beside prince nesvítski count ilyá rostóv with the 
other members of the committee sat facing bagratión and as the very personification of moscow 
hospitality did the honors to the prince his efforts had not been in vain the 
dinner both the lenten and the other fare was splendid yet he could not feel 
quite at ease till the end of the meal he winked at the butler whispered 
directions to the footmen and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety everything was excellent 
with the second course a gigantic sterlet at sight of which ilyá rostóv blushed with 
self conscious pleasure the footmen began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses after the 
fish which made a certain sensation the count exchanged glances with the other committeemen will 
be many toasts time to begin he whispered and taking up his glass he rose 
all were silent waiting for what he would say the health of our sovereign the 
emperor he cried and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears 
of joy and enthusiasm the band immediately struck up joyful thunder waken all rose and 
cried bagratión also rose and shouted in exactly the same voice in which he had 
shouted it on the field at schön grabern young ecstatic voice could be heard above 
the three hundred others he nearly wept the health of our sovereign the emperor he 
roared and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor many 
followed his example and the loud shouting continued for a long time when the voices 
subsided the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody sat down again smiling at 
the noise they had made and exchanging remarks the old count rose once more glanced 
at a note lying beside his plate and proposed a toast the health of the 
hero of our last campaign prince peter ivánovich bagratión and again his blue eyes grew 
moist cried the three hundred voices again but instead of the band a choir began 
singing a cantata composed by paul ivánovich kutúzov russians all barriers on courage conquest guarantees 
have we not bagratión he brings foemen to their knees etc as soon as the 
singing was over another and another toast was proposed and count ilyá rostóv became more 
and more moved more glass was smashed and the shouting grew louder they drank to 
bekleshëv narýshkin uvárov dolgorúkov apráksin valúev to the committee to all the club members and 
to all the club guests and finally to count ilyá rostóv separately as the organizer 
of the banquet at that toast the count took out his handkerchief and covering his 
face wept outright chapter iv pierre sat opposite dólokhov and nicholas rostóv as usual he 
ate and drank much and eagerly but those who knew him intimately noticed that some 
great change had come over him that day he was silent all through dinner and 
looked about blinking and scowling or with fixed eyes and a look of complete absent 
mindedness kept rubbing the bridge of his nose his face was depressed and gloomy he 
seemed to see and hear nothing of what was going on around him and to 
be absorbed by some depressing and unsolved problem the unsolved problem that tormented him was 
caused by hints given by the princess his cousin at moscow concerning intimacy with his 
wife and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning which in the mean 
jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly through his spectacles but 
that his connection with dólokhov was a secret to no one but himself pierre absolutely 
disbelieved both the hints and the letter but he feared now to look at dólokhov 
who was sitting opposite him every time he chanced to meet handsome insolent eyes pierre 
felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly away involuntarily recalling 
his past and her relations with dólokhov pierre saw clearly that what was said in 
the letter might be true or might at least seem to be true had it 
not referred to his wife he involuntarily remembered how dólokhov who had fully recovered his 
former position after the campaign had returned to petersburg and come to him availing himself 
of his friendly relations with pierre as a boon companion dólokhov had come straight to 
his house and pierre had put him up and lent him money pierre recalled how 
hélène had smilingly expressed disapproval of living at their house and how cynically dólokhov had 
praised his beauty to him and from that time till they came to moscow had 
not left them for a day he is very handsome thought pierre i know him 
it would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me just 
because i have exerted myself on his behalf befriended him and helped him i know 
and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasure of deceiving me if 
it really were true yes if it were true but i do not believe it 
i have no right to and believe it he remembered the expression face assumed in 
his moments of cruelty as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them 
into the water or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason 
or shot a post horse with a pistol that expression was often on face when 
looking at him he is a bully thought pierre kill a man means nothing to 
him it must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him and that must 
please him he must think that i too am afraid of in fact i am 
afraid of him he thought and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in 
his soul dólokhov denísov and rostóv were now sitting opposite pierre and seemed very gay 
rostóv was talking merrily to his two friends one of whom was a dashing hussar 
and the other a notorious duelist and rake and every now and then he glanced 
ironically at pierre whose preoccupied absent minded and massive figure was a very noticeable one 
at the dinner rostóv looked inimically at pierre first because pierre appeared to his hussar 
eyes as a rich civilian the husband of a beauty and in a old woman 
and secondly because pierre in his preoccupation and absent mindedness had not recognized rostóv and 
had not responded to his greeting when the health was drunk pierre lost in thought 
did not rise or lift his glass are you about shouted rostóv looking at him 
in an ecstasy of exasperation you hear his majesty the health pierre sighed rose submissively 
emptied his glass and waiting till all were seated again turned with his kindly smile 
to rostóv i recognize you he said but rostóv was otherwise engaged he was shouting 
you renew the acquaintance said dólokhov to rostóv him a fool said rostóv should make 
up to the husbands of pretty women said denísov pierre did not catch what they 
were saying but knew they were talking about him he reddened and turned away now 
to the health of handsome women said dólokhov and with a serious expression but with 
a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth he turned with his glass to 
pierre to the health of lovely women their lovers he added pierre with downcast eyes 
drank out of his glass without looking at dólokhov or answering him the footman who 
was distributing leaflets with cantata laid one before pierre as one of the principal guests 
he was just going to take it when dólokhov leaning across snatched it from his 
hand and began reading it pierre looked at dólokhov and his eyes dropped the something 
terrible and monstrous that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him 
he leaned his whole massive body across the table dare you take it he shouted 
hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed nesvítski and the neighbor on 
his right quickly turned in alarm to bezúkhov what are you about whispered their frightened 
voices dólokhov looked at pierre with clear mirthful cruel eyes and that smile of his 
which seemed to say this is what i like have it he said distinctly pale 
with quivering lips pierre snatched the copy you scoundrel i challenge you he ejaculated and 
pushing back his chair he rose from the table at the very instant he did 
this and uttered those words pierre felt that the question of his guilt which had 
been tormenting him the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative he 
hated her and was forever sundered from her despite request that he would take no 
part in the matter rostóv agreed to be second and after dinner he discussed the 
arrangements for the duel with nesvítski second pierre went home but rostóv with dólokhov and 
denísov stayed on at the club till late listening to the gypsies and other singers 
then till tomorrow at sokólniki said dólokhov as he took leave of rostóv in the 
club porch do you feel quite calm rostóv asked dólokhov paused you see tell you 
the whole secret of dueling in two words if you are going to fight a 
duel and you make a will and write affectionate letters to your parents and if 
you think you may be killed you are a fool and are lost for certain 
but go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as 
possible and then all will be right as our bear huntsman at kostromá used to 
tell me fears a bear he says when you see one your all gone and 
your only thought is not to let him get away and how it is with 
me à demain mon cher till tomorrow my dear fellow next day at eight in 
the morning pierre and nesvítski drove to the sokólniki forest and found dólokhov denísov and 
rostóv already there pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had 
no connection with the matter in hand his haggard face was yellow he had evidently 
not slept that night he looked about distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if 
dazzled by the sun he was entirely absorbed by two considerations his guilt of which 
after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt and the guiltlessness of dólokhov 
who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to 
him should perhaps have done the same thing in his place thought pierre even certain 
that i should have done the same then why this duel this murder either i 
shall kill him or he will hit me in the head or elbow or knee 
i go away from here run away bury myself somewhere passed through his mind but 
just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him he would ask in a particularly 
calm and absent minded way which inspired the respect of the onlookers it be long 
are things ready when all was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark 
the barriers and the pistols loaded nesvítski went up to pierre should not be doing 
my duty count he said in timid tones should not justify your confidence and the 
honor you have done me in choosing me for your second if at this grave 
this very grave moment i did not tell you the whole truth i think there 
is no sufficient ground for this affair or for blood to be shed over it 
you were not right not quite in the right you were impetuous yes it is 
horribly stupid said pierre allow me to express your regrets and i am sure your 
opponent will accept them said nesvítski who like the others concerned in the affair and 
like everyone in similar cases did not yet believe that the affair had come to 
an actual duel know count it is much more honorable to admit mistake than to 
let matters become irreparable there was no insult on either side allow me to convey 
what is there to talk about said pierre all the same is everything ready he 
added tell me where to go and where to shoot he said with an unnaturally 
gentle smile he took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working 
of the trigger as he had not before held a pistol in his fact that 
he did not wish to confess yes like that i know i only forgot said 
he apologies none whatever said dólokhov to denísov who on his side had been attempting 
a reconciliation and he also went up to the appointed place the spot chosen for 
the duel was some eighty paces from the road where the sleighs had been left 
in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with melting snow the frost having 
begun to break up during the last few days the antagonists stood forty paces apart 
at the farther edge of the clearing the seconds measuring the paces left tracks in 
the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and and sabers 
which were stuck into the ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier it was 
thawing and misty at forty distance nothing could be seen for three minutes all had 
been ready but they still delayed and all were silent chapter v begin said dólokhov 
right said pierre still smiling in the same way a feeling of dread was in 
the air it was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer be 
averted but was taking its course independently of will denísov first went to the barrier 
and announced the have wefused a weconciliation please pwoceed take your pistols and at the 
word thwee begin to advance ne t wo thwee he shouted angrily and stepped aside 
the combatants advanced along the trodden tracks nearer and nearer to one another beginning to 
see one another through the mist they had the right to fire when they liked 
as they approached the barrier dólokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol looking intently with 
his bright sparkling blue eyes into his face his mouth wore its usual semblance of 
a smile i can fire when i like said pierre and at the word he 
went quickly forward missing the trodden path and stepping into the deep snow he held 
the pistol in his right hand at length apparently afraid of shooting himself with it 
his left hand he held carefully back because he wished to support his right hand 
with it and knew he must not do so having advanced six paces and strayed 
off the track into the snow pierre looked down at his feet then quickly glanced 
at dólokhov and bending his finger as he had been shown fired not at all 
expecting so loud a report pierre shuddered at the sound and then smiling at his 
own sensations stood still the smoke rendered denser by the mist prevented him from seeing 
anything for an instant but there was no second report as he had expected he 
only heard hurried steps and his figure came in view through the smoke he was 
pressing one hand to his left side while the other clutched his drooping pistol his 
face was pale rostóv ran toward him and said something o o muttered dólokhov through 
his teeth not over and after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the 
saber he sank on the snow beside it his left hand was bloody he wiped 
it on his coat and supported himself with it his frowning face was pallid and 
quivered began dólokhov but could not at first pronounce the word he uttered with an 
effort pierre hardly restraining his sobs began running toward dólokhov and was about to cross 
the space between the barriers when dólokhov cried your barrier and pierre grasping what was 
meant stopped by his saber only ten paces divided them dólokhov lowered his head to 
the snow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himself drew in his 
legs and sat up seeking a firm center of gravity he sucked and swallowed the 
cold snow his lips quivered but his eyes still smiling glittered with effort and exasperation 
as he mustered his remaining strength he raised his pistol and aimed cover yourself with 
your pistol ejaculated nesvítski yourself even denísov cried to his adversary pierre with a gentle 
smile of pity and remorse his arms and legs helplessly spread out stood with his 
broad chest directly facing dólokhov and looked sorrowfully at him denísov rostóv and nesvítski closed 
their eyes at the same instant they heard a report and angry cry shouted dólokhov 
and he lay helplessly face downwards on the snow pierre clutched his temples and turning 
round went into the forest trampling through the deep snow and muttering incoherent words folly 
death lies he repeated puckering his face nesvítski stopped him and took him home rostóv 
and denísov drove away with the wounded dólokhov the latter lay silent in the sleigh 
with closed eyes and did not answer a word to the questions addressed to him 
but on entering moscow he suddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort 
took rostóv who was sitting beside him by the hand rostóv was struck by the 
totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on face how do you feel he 
asked but not that my said dólokhov with a gasping voice are we in moscow 
i know i matter but i have killed her killed she get over it she 
survive asked rostóv mother my mother my angel my adored angel mother and dólokhov pressed 
hand and burst into tears when he had become a little quieter he explained to 
rostóv that he was living with his mother who if she saw him dying would 
not survive it he implored rostóv to go on and prepare her rostóv went on 
ahead to do what was asked and to his great surprise learned that dólokhov the 
brawler dólokhov the bully lived in moscow with an old mother and a hunchback sister 
and was the most affectionate of sons and brothers chapter vi pierre had of late 
rarely seen his wife alone both in petersburg and in moscow their house was always 
full of visitors the night after the duel he did not go to his bedroom 
but as he often did remained in his room that huge room in which count 
bezúkhov had died he lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget 
all that had happened to him but could not do so such a storm of 
feelings thoughts and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall asleep nor 
even remain in one place but had to jump up and pace the room with 
rapid steps now he seemed to see her in the early days of their marriage 
with bare shoulders and a languid passionate look on her face and then immediately he 
saw beside her handsome insolent hard and mocking face as he had seen it at 
the banquet and then that same face pale quivering and suffering as it had been 
when he reeled and sank on the snow has happened he asked himself have killed 
her lover yes killed my lover yes that was it and why how did i 
come to do it you married her answered an inner voice in what was i 
to blame he asked marrying her without loving her in deceiving yourself and her and 
he vividly recalled that moment after supper at prince when he spoke those words he 
had found so difficult to utter love you all comes from that even then i 
felt it he thought felt then that it was not so that i had no 
right to do it and so it turns out he remembered his honeymoon and blushed 
at the recollection particularly vivid humiliating and shameful was the recollection of how one day 
soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his study a little 
before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head steward there who bowing 
respectfully looked into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly as if 
expressing respectful understanding of his happiness how often i have felt proud of her proud 
of her majestic beauty and social tact thought he proud of my house in which 
she received all petersburg proud of her unapproachability and beauty so this is what i 
was proud of i then thought that i did not understand her how often when 
considering her character i have told myself that i was to blame for not understanding 
her for not understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or 
desires and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved 
woman now i have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become clear used 
to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her naked shoulders she 
did not give him the money but let herself be kissed her father in jest 
tried to rouse her jealousy and she replied with a calm smile that she was 
not so stupid as to be jealous him do what he pleases she used to 
say of me one day i asked her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy 
she laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want to have children 
and that she was not going to have any children by me then he recalled 
the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were 
natural to her though she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles not 
such a fool just you try it on allez vous promener she used to say 
often seeing the success she had with young and old men and women pierre could 
not understand why he did not love her clear out of this i never loved 
her said he to himself knew she was a depraved woman he repeated dared not 
admit it to myself and now dólokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile 
and perhaps dying while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado pierre was one of 
those people who in spite of an appearance of what is called weak character do 
not seek a confidant in their troubles he digested his sufferings alone is all all 
her fault he said to himself what of that why did i bind myself to 
her why did i say vous to her which was a lie and worse than 
a lie i am guilty and must endure what a slur on my name a 
misfortune for life oh nonsense he thought slur on my name and all apart from 
myself i love you xvi was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a 
criminal came into head from their point of view they were right as were those 
too who canonized him and died a death for his sake then robespierre was beheaded 
for being a despot who is right and who is wrong no one but if 
you are tomorrow die as i might have died an hour ago and is it 
worth tormenting oneself when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity 
but at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections she suddenly came 
into his mind as she was at the moments when he had most strongly expressed 
his insincere love for her and he felt the blood rush to his heart and 
had again to get up and move about and break and tear whatever came to 
his hand did i tell her that vous he kept repeating to himself and when 
he had said it for the tenth time words que diable allait il faire dans 
cette galère occurred to him and he began to laugh at himself what the devil 
was he doing in that galley in the night he called his valet and told 
him to pack up to go to petersburg he could not imagine how he could 
speak to her now he resolved to go away next day and leave a letter 
informing her of his intention to part from her forever next morning when the valet 
came into the room with his coffee pierre was lying asleep on the ottoman with 
an open book in his hand he woke up and looked round for a while 
with a startled expression unable to realize where he was countess told me to inquire 
whether your excellency was at home said the valet but before pierre could decide what 
answer he would send the countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with 
silver and with simply dressed hair two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like 
a coronet entered the room calm and majestic except that there was a wrathful wrinkle 
on her rather prominent marble brow with her imperturbable calm she did not begin to 
speak in front of the valet she knew of the duel and had come to 
speak about it she waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and 
left the room pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles and like a hare 
surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her 
enemies he tried to continue reading but feeling this to be senseless and impossible he 
again glanced timidly at her she did not sit down but looked at him with 
a contemptuous smile waiting for the valet to go this now what have you been 
up to now i should like to know she asked sternly what have i stammered 
pierre it seems a hero eh come now what was this duel about what is 
it meant to prove what i ask you pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman 
and opened his mouth but could not reply you answer tell you hélène went on 
believe everything told you were told hélène laughed dólokhov was my lover she said in 
french with her coarse plainness of speech uttering the word amant as casually as any 
other word you believed it well what have you proved what does this duel prove 
that a fool que vous êtes un sot but everybody knew that what will be 
the result that i shall be the laughingstock of all moscow that everyone will say 
that you drunk and not knowing what you were about challenged a man you are 
jealous of without cause hélène raised her voice and became more and more excited man 
a better man than you in every way hm growled pierre frowning without looking at 
her and not moving a muscle how could you believe he was my lover why 
because i like his company if you were cleverer and more agreeable i should prefer 
yours speak to me i beg you muttered pierre hoarsely i speak i can speak 
as i like and i tell you plainly that there are not many wives with 
husbands such as you who would not have taken lovers des amants but i have 
not done so said she pierre wished to say something looked at her with eyes 
whose strange expression she did not understand and lay down again he was suffering physically 
at that moment there was a weight on his chest and he could not breathe 
he knew that he must do something to put an end to this suffering but 
what he wanted to do was too terrible had better separate he muttered in a 
broken voice very well but only if you give me a fortune said hélène a 
thing to frighten me with pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward 
her kill you he shouted and seizing the marble top of a table with a 
strength he had never before felt he made a step toward her brandishing the slab 
face became terrible she shrieked and sprang aside his nature showed itself in pierre he 
felt the fascination and delight of frenzy he flung down the slab broke it and 
swooping down on her with outstretched hands shouted out in such a terrible voice that 
the whole house heard it with horror god knows what he would have done at 
that moment had hélène not fled from the room a week later pierre gave his 
wife full power to control all his estates in great russia which formed the larger 
part of his property and left for petersburg alone chapter vii two months had elapsed 
since the news of the battle of austerlitz and the loss of prince andrew had 
reached bald hills and in spite of the letters sent through the embassy and all 
the searches made his body had not been found nor was he on the list 
of prisoners what was worst of all for his relations was the fact that there 
was still a possibility of his having been picked up on the battlefield by the 
people of the place and that he might now be lying recovering or dying alone 
among strangers and unable to send news of himself the gazettes from which the old 
prince first heard of the defeat at austerlitz stated as usual very briefly and vaguely 
that after brilliant engagements the russians had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal 
in perfect order the old prince understood from this official report that our army had 
been defeated a week after the gazette report of the battle of austerlitz came a 
letter from kutúzov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son son 
wrote kutúzov before my eyes a standard in his hand and at the head of 
a fell as a hero worthy of his father and his fatherland to the great 
regret of myself and of the whole army it is still uncertain whether he is 
alive or not i comfort myself and you with the hope that your son is 
alive for otherwise he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field 
of battle a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce after 
receiving this news late in the evening when he was alone in his study the 
old prince went for his walk as usual next morning but he was silent with 
his steward the gardener and the architect and though he looked very grim he said 
nothing to anyone when princess mary went to him at the usual hour he was 
working at his lathe and as usual did not look round at her princess mary 
he said suddenly in an unnatural voice throwing down his chisel the wheel continued to 
revolve by its own impetus and princess mary long remembered the dying creak of that 
wheel which merged in her memory with what followed she approached him saw his face 
and something gave way within her her eyes grew dim by the expression of her 
face not sad not crushed but angry and working unnaturally she saw that hanging over 
her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune the worst in life one 
she had not yet experienced irreparable and death of one she loved andrew the ungraceful 
awkward princess with such an indescribable charm of sorrow and self forgetfulness that her father 
could not bear her look but turned away with a sob news not among the 
prisoners nor among the killed kutúzov writes and he screamed as piercingly as if he 
wished to drive the princess away by that scream the princess did not fall down 
or faint she was already pale but on hearing these words her face changed and 
something brightened in her beautiful radiant eyes it was as if supreme joy apart from 
the joys and sorrows of this the great grief within her she forgot all fear 
of her father went up to him took his hand and drawing him down put 
her arm round his thin scraggy neck she said not turn away from me let 
us weep together blackguards shrieked the old man turning his face away from her the 
army destroying the men and why go go and tell lise the princess sank helplessly 
into an armchair beside her father and wept she saw her brother now as he 
had been at the moment when he took leave of her and of lise his 
look tender yet proud she saw him tender and amused as he was when he 
put on the little icon he believe had he repented of his unbelief was he 
now there there in the realms of eternal peace and blessedness she thought tell me 
how it happened she asked through her tears go killed in battle where the best 
of russian men and glory were led to destruction go princess mary go and tell 
lise i will follow when princess mary returned from her father the little princess sat 
working and looked up with that curious expression of inner happy calm peculiar to pregnant 
women it was evident that her eyes did not see princess mary but were looking 
within into herself at something joyful and mysterious taking place within her she said moving 
away from the embroidery frame and lying back me your hand she took her sister 
in hand and held it below her waist her eyes were smiling expectantly her downy 
lip rose and remained lifted in childlike happiness princess mary knelt down before her and 
hid her face in the folds of her sister in dress there do you feel 
it i feel so strange and do you know mary i am going to love 
him very much said lise looking with bright and happy eyes at her sister in 
law princess mary could not lift her head she was weeping is the matter mary 
only i feel sad sad about andrew she said wiping away her tears on her 
sister in knee several times in the course of the morning princess mary began trying 
to prepare her sister in law and every time began to cry unobservant as was 
the little princess these tears the cause of which she did not understand agitated her 
she said nothing but looked about uneasily as if in search of something before dinner 
the old prince of whom she was always afraid came into her room with a 
peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without saying a word she looked 
at princess mary then sat thinking for a while with that expression of attention to 
something within her that is only seen in pregnant women and suddenly began to cry 
anything come from andrew she asked you know too soon for news but my father 
is anxious and i feel afraid nothing answered princess mary looking firmly with her radiant 
eyes at her sister in law she had determined not to tell her and persuaded 
her father to hide the terrible news from her till after her confinement which was 
expected within a few days princess mary and the old prince each bore and hid 
their grief in their own way the old prince would not cherish any hope he 
made up his mind that prince andrew had been killed and though he sent an 
official to austria to seek for traces of his son he ordered a monument from 
moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his memory and he 
told everybody that his son had been killed he tried not to change his former 
way of life but his strength failed him he walked less ate less slept less 
and became weaker every day princess mary hoped she prayed for her brother as living 
and was always awaiting news of his return chapter viii said the little princess after 
breakfast on the morning of the nineteenth march and her downy little lip rose from 
old habit but as sorrow was manifest in every smile the sound of every word 
and even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come so now 
the smile of the little by the general mood though without knowing its such as 
to remind one still more of the general sorrow afraid this fruschtique fóka the cook 
calls disagreed with me frühstück breakfast is the matter with you my darling you look 
pale oh you are very pale said princess mary in alarm running with her soft 
ponderous steps up to her sister in law excellency should not mary bogdánovna be sent 
for said one of the maids who was present mary bogdánovna was a midwife from 
the neighboring town who had been at bald hills for the last fortnight yes assented 
princess mary it go courage my angel she kissed lise and was about to leave 
the room no no and besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the little 
face an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain showed itself only indigestion say only 
indigestion say so mary say and the little princess began to cry capriciously like a 
suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some affectation princess mary ran 
out of the room to fetch mary bogdánovna dieu mon dieu oh she heard as 
she left the room the midwife was already on her way to meet her rubbing 
her small plump white hands with an air of calm importance bogdánovna i think beginning 
said princess mary looking at the midwife with wide open eyes of alarm the lord 
be thanked princess said mary bogdánovna not hastening her steps young ladies should not know 
anything about it how is it the doctor from moscow is not here yet said 
the princess in accordance with and prince wishes they had sent in good time to 
moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any moment matter princess be alarmed 
said mary bogdánovna manage very well without a doctor five minutes later princess mary from 
her room heard something heavy being carried by she looked out the men servants were 
carrying the large leather sofa from prince study into the bedroom on their faces was 
a quiet and solemn look princess mary sat alone in her room listening to the 
sounds in the house now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching 
what was going on in the passage some women passing with quiet steps in and 
out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away she did not venture 
to ask any questions and shut the door again now sitting down in her easy 
chair now taking her prayer book now kneeling before the icon stand to her surprise 
and distress she found that her prayers did not calm her excitement suddenly her door 
opened softly and her old nurse praskóvya sávishna who hardly ever came to that room 
as the old prince had forbidden it appeared on the threshold with a shawl round 
her head come to sit with you a bit másha said the nurse here brought 
the wedding candles to light before his saint my angel she said with a sigh 
nurse so glad is merciful birdie the nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons 
and sat down by the door with her knitting princess mary took a book and 
began reading only when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another 
the princess anxious and inquiring the nurse encouraging everyone in the house was dominated by 
the same feeling that princess mary experienced as she sat in her room but owing 
to the superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the less a 
woman in travail suffers everyone tried to pretend not to know no one spoke of 
it but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the household 
a common anxiety a softening of the heart and a consciousness that something great and 
mysterious was being accomplished at that moment made itself felt there was no laughter in 
the large hall in the men hall all sat waiting silently and alert in the 
outlying quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept the old prince stepping 
on his heels paced up and down his study and sent tíkhon to ask mary 
bogdánovna what news only that prince told me to ask and come and tell me 
her answer the prince that labor has begun said mary bogdánovna giving the messenger a 
significant look tíkhon went and told the prince good said the prince closing the door 
behind him and tíkhon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that 
after a while he re entered it as if to snuff the candles and seeing 
the prince was lying on the sofa looked at him noticed his perturbed face shook 
his head and going up to him silently kissed him on the shoulder and left 
the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he had entered the most solemn 
mystery in the world continued its course evening passed night came and the feeling of 
suspense and softening of heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but 
increased no one slept it was one of those march nights when winter seems to 
wish to resume its sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury 
a relay of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the german doctor 
from moscow who was expected every moment and men on horseback with lanterns were sent 
to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its hollows and snow 
covered pools of water princess mary had long since put aside her book she sat 
silent her luminous eyes fixed on her wrinkled face every line of which she knew 
so well on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the kerchief and 
the loose skin that hung under her chin nurse sávishna knitting in hand was telling 
in low tones scarcely hearing or understanding her own words what she had told hundreds 
of times before how the late princess had given birth to princess mary in kishenëv 
with only a moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a midwife is merciful doctors 
are never needed she said suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement 
of the window from which the double frame had been removed by order of the 
prince one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks returned 
and forcing open a loosely closed latch set the damask curtain flapping and blew out 
the candle with its chill snowy draft princess mary shuddered her nurse putting down the 
stocking she was knitting went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the 
open casement the cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose locks 
of gray hair my dear someone driving up the avenue she said holding the casement 
and not closing it lanterns most likely the doctor my god thank god said princess 
mary must go and meet him he does not know russian princess mary threw a 
shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer as she was crossing the 
anteroom she saw through the window a carriage with lanterns standing at the entrance she 
went out on the stairs on a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered 
in the draft on the landing below philip the footman stood looking scared and holding 
another candle still lower beyond the turn of the staircase one could hear the footstep 
of someone in thick felt boots and a voice that seemed familiar to princess mary 
was saying something god said the voice father to bed replied the voice of demyán 
the house steward who was downstairs then the voice said something more demyán replied and 
the steps in the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly 
andrew thought princess mary it be that would be too extraordinary and at the very 
moment she thought this the face and figure of prince andrew in a fur cloak 
the deep collar of which covered with snow appeared on the landing where the footman 
stood with the candle yes it was he pale thin with a changed and strangely 
softened but agitated expression on his face he came up the stairs and embraced his 
sister did not get my letter he asked and not waiting for a he would 
not have received for the princess was unable to turned back rapidly mounted the stairs 
again with the doctor who had entered the hall after him they had met at 
the last post station and again embraced his sister a strange fate másha darling and 
having taken off his cloak and felt boots he went to the little apartment chapter 
ix the little princess lay supported by pillows with a white cap on her head 
the pains had just left her strands of her black hair lay round her inflamed 
and perspiring cheeks her charming rosy mouth with its downy lip was open and she 
was smiling joyfully prince andrew entered and paused facing her at the foot of the 
sofa on which she was lying her glittering eyes filled with childlike fear and excitement 
rested on him without changing their expression love you all and have done no harm 
to anyone why must i suffer so help me her look seemed to say she 
saw her husband but did not realize the significance of his appearance before her now 
prince andrew went round the sofa and kissed her forehead darling he word he had 
never used to her before is merciful she looked at him inquiringly and with childlike 
reproach expected help from you and i get none none from you either said her 
eyes she was not surprised at his having come she did not realize that he 
had come his coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or with their relief 
the pangs began again and mary bogdánovna advised prince andrew to leave the room the 
doctor entered prince andrew went out and meeting princess mary again joined her they began 
talking in whispers but their talk broke off at every moment they waited and listened 
dear said princess mary prince andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in 
the room next to hers a woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face 
and became confused when she saw prince andrew he covered his face with his hands 
and remained so for some minutes piteous helpless animal moans came through the door prince 
andrew got up went to the door and tried to open it someone was holding 
it shut come in you said a terrified voice from within he began pacing the 
room the screaming ceased and a few more seconds went by then suddenly a terrible 
could not be hers she could not scream like from the bedroom prince andrew ran 
to the door the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant have 
they taken a baby in there for thought prince andrew in the first second baby 
what baby why is there a baby there or is the baby born then suddenly 
he realized the joyful significance of that wail tears choked him and leaning his elbows 
on the window sill he began to cry sobbing like a child the door opened 
the doctor with his shirt sleeves tucked up without a coat pale and with a 
trembling jaw came out of the room prince andrew turned to him but the doctor 
gave him a bewildered look and passed by without a word a woman rushed out 
and seeing prince andrew stopped hesitating on the threshold he went into his room she 
was lying dead in the same position he had seen her in five minutes before 
and despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks the same expression was 
on her charming childlike face with its upper lip covered with tiny black hair love 
you all and have done no harm to anyone and what have you done to 
me her charming pathetic dead face in a corner of the room something red and 
tiny gave a grunt and squealed in mary trembling white hands two hours later prince 
andrew stepping softly went into his room the old man already knew everything he was 
standing close to the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms 
closed like a vise round his neck and without a word he began to sob 
like a child three days later the little princess was buried and prince andrew went 
up the steps to where the coffin stood to give her the farewell kiss and 
there in the coffin was the same face though with closed eyes what have you 
done to me it still seemed to say and prince andrew felt that something gave 
way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin he could neither 
remedy nor forget he could not weep the old man too came up and kissed 
the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed one on the other on her breast 
and to him too her face seemed to say what have you done to me 
and why and at the sight the old man turned angrily away another five days 
passed and then the young prince nicholas andréevich was baptized the wet nurse supported the 
coverlet with her chin while the priest with a goose feather anointed the little red 
and wrinkled soles and palms his grandfather who was his godfather trembling and afraid of 
dropping him carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over to 
the godmother princess mary prince andrew sat in another room faint with fear lest the 
baby should be drowned in the font and awaited the termination of the ceremony he 
looked up joyfully at the baby when the nurse brought it to him and nodded 
approval when she told him that the wax with the hair had not sunk in 
the font but had floated chapter x share in duel with bezúkhov was hushed up 
by the efforts of the old count and instead of being degraded to the ranks 
as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of moscow as 
a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the family 
but was kept all summer in moscow by his new duties dólokhov recovered and rostóv 
became very friendly with him during his convalescence dólokhov lay ill at his who loved 
him passionately and tenderly and old mary ivánovna who had grown fond of rostóv for 
his friendship to her fédya often talked to him about her son count she would 
say is too noble and pure souled for our present depraved world no one now 
loves virtue it seems like a reproach to everyone now tell me count was it 
right was it honorable of bezúkhov and fédya with his noble spirit loved him and 
even now never says a word against him those pranks in petersburg when they played 
some tricks on a policeman they do it together and there bezúkhov got off scotfree 
while fédya had to bear the whole burden on his shoulders fancy what he had 
to go through true he has been reinstated but how could they fail to do 
that i think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there 
as he and duel have these people no feeling or honor knowing him to be 
an only son to challenge him and shoot so straight well god had mercy on 
us and what was it for who have intrigues nowadays why if he was so 
jealous as i see things he should have shown it sooner but he lets it 
go on for months and then to call him out reckoning on fédya not fighting 
because he owed him money what baseness what meanness i know you understand fédya my 
dear count that believe me is why i am so fond of you few people 
do understand him he is such a lofty heavenly soul dólokhov himself during his convalescence 
spoke to rostóv in a way no one would have expected of him know people 
consider me a bad man he said them i care a straw about anyone but 
those i love but those i love i love so that i would give my 
life for them and the others throttle if they stood in my way i have 
an adored a priceless mother and two or three among as for the rest i 
only care about them in so far as they are harmful or useful and most 
of them are harmful especially the women yes dear boy he continued have met loving 
noble high minded men but i have not yet met any or were not venal 
i have not yet met that divine purity and devotion i look for in women 
if i found such a one give my life for her but those and he 
made a gesture of contempt believe me if i still value my life it is 
only because i still hope to meet such a divine creature who will regenerate purify 
and elevate me but you understand it yes i quite understand answered rostóv who was 
under his new influence in the autumn the rostóvs returned to moscow early in the 
winter denísov also came back and stayed with them the first half of the winter 
of 1806 which nicholas rostóv spent in moscow was one of the happiest merriest times 
for him and the whole family nicholas brought many young men to his house véra 
was a handsome girl of twenty sónya a girl of sixteen with all the charm 
of an opening flower natásha half grown up and half child was now childishly amusing 
now girlishly enchanting at that time in the house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere characteristic 
of homes where there are very young and very charming girls every young man who 
came to the those impressionable smiling young faces smiling probably at their own happiness feeling 
the eager bustle around him and hearing the fitful bursts of song and music and 
the inconsequent but friendly prattle of young girls ready for anything and full of the 
same feeling sharing with the young folk of the household a readiness to fall in 
love and an expectation of happiness among the young men introduced by rostóv one of 
the first was dólokhov whom everyone in the house liked except natásha she almost quarreled 
with her brother about him she insisted that he was a bad man and that 
in the duel with bezúkhov pierre was right and dólokhov wrong and further that he 
was disagreeable and unnatural nothing for me to understand she cried out with resolute self 
will is wicked and heartless there now i like your denísov though he is a 
rake and all that still i like him so you see i do understand i 
know how to put it with this one everything is calculated and i like that 
but denísov denísov is quite different replied nicholas implying that even denísov was nothing compared 
to must understand what a soul there is in dólokhov you should see him with 
his mother what a heart i know about that but i am uncomfortable with him 
and do you know he has fallen in love with sónya nonsense certain of it 
see prediction proved true dólokhov who did not usually care for the society of ladies 
began to come often to the house and the question for whose sake he came 
though no one spoke of it was soon settled he came because of sónya and 
sónya though she would never have dared to say so knew it and blushed scarlet 
every time dólokhov appeared dólokhov often dined at the never missed a performance at which 
they were present and went to balls for young people which the rostóvs always attended 
he was pointedly attentive to sónya and looked at her in such a way that 
not only could she not bear his glances without coloring but even the old countess 
and natásha blushed when they saw his looks it was evident that this strange strong 
man was under the irresistible influence of the dark graceful girl who loved another rostóv 
noticed something new in relations with sónya but he did not explain to himself what 
these new relations were always in love with someone he thought of sónya and natásha 
but he was not as much at ease with sónya and dólokhov as before and 
was less frequently at home in the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking 
of the war with napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before orders were 
given to raise recruits ten men in every thousand for the regular army and besides 
this nine men in every thousand for the militia everywhere bonaparte was anathematized and in 
moscow nothing but the coming war was talked of for the rostóv family the whole 
interest of these preparations for war lay in the fact that nicholas would not hear 
of remaining in moscow and only awaited the termination of furlough after christmas to return 
with him to their regiment his approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself but 
rather gave zest to his pleasures he spent the greater part of his time away 
from home at dinners parties and balls chapter xi on the third day after christmas 
nicholas dined at home a thing he had rarely done of late it was a 
grand farewell dinner as he and denísov were leaving to join their regiment after epiphany 
about twenty people were present including dólokhov and denísov never had love been so much 
in the air and never had the amorous atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in 
the house as at this holiday time the moments of happiness love and be loved 
that is the only reality in the world all else is folly it is the 
one thing we are interested in here said the spirit of the place nicholas having 
as usual exhausted two pairs of horses without visiting all the places he meant to 
go to and where he had been invited returned home just before dinner as soon 
as he entered he noticed and felt the tension of the amorous air in the 
house and also noticed a curious embarrassment among some of those present sónya dólokhov and 
the old countess were especially disturbed and to a lesser degree natásha nicholas understood that 
something must have happened between sónya and dólokhov before dinner and with the kindly sensitiveness 
natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner on that 
same evening there was to be one of the balls that iogel the dancing master 
gave for his pupils during the holidays will you come to please do said natásha 
asked you and vasíli dmítrich is also going denísov would i not go at the 
command said denísov who at the had jocularly assumed the role of knight even weady 
to dance the pas de châle i have time answered nicholas i promised the arkhárovs 
they have a party you he asked dólokhov but as soon as he had asked 
the question he noticed that it should not have been put coldly and angrily replied 
dólokhov glancing at sónya and scowling he gave nicholas just such a look as he 
had given pierre at the club dinner is something up thought nicholas and he was 
further confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that dólokhov left immediately after dinner he 
called natásha and asked her what was the matter i was looking for you said 
natásha running out to him told you but you would not believe it she said 
triumphantly has proposed to sónya little as nicholas had occupied himself with sónya of late 
something seemed to give way within him at this news dólokhov was a suitable and 
in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan girl from the point of 
view of the old countess and of society it was out of the question for 
her to refuse him and therefore first feeling on hearing the news was one of 
anger with sónya he tried to say capital of course forget her childish promises and 
accept the offer but before he had time to say it natásha began again fancy 
she refused him quite definitely adding after a pause told him she loved another my 
sónya could not have done otherwise thought nicholas as mamma pressed her she refused and 
i know she change once she has said mamma pressed her said nicholas reproachfully said 
natásha you know be i know you will not marry her i know heaven knows 
how but i know for certain that you marry her you know that at all 
said nicholas i must talk to her what a darling sónya is he added with 
a smile she is indeed a darling send her to you and natásha kissed her 
brother and ran away a minute later sónya came in with a frightened guilty and 
scared look nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand this was the first 
time since his return that they had talked alone and about their love he began 
timidly at first and then more and more boldly you wish to refuse one who 
is not only a brilliant and advantageous match but a splendid noble fellow he is 
my friend sónya interrupted him have already refused she said hurriedly you are refusing for 
my sake i am afraid that i sónya again interrupted she gave him an imploring 
frightened look tell me that she said but i must it may be arrogant of 
me but still it is best to say it if you refuse him on my 
account i must tell you the whole truth i love you and i think i 
love you more than anyone else is enough for me said sónya blushing but i 
have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love again though for 
no one have i such a feeling of friendship confidence and love as i have 
for you then i am young mamma does not wish it in a word i 
make no promise and i beg you to consider offer he said articulating his name 
with difficulty say that to me i want nothing i love you as a brother 
and always shall and i want nothing more are an angel i am not worthy 
of you but i am afraid of misleading you and nicholas again kissed her hand 
chapter xii were the most enjoyable balls in moscow so said the mothers as they 
watched their young people executing their newly learned steps and so said the youths and 
maidens themselves as they danced till they were ready to drop and so said the 
grown up young men and women who came to these balls with an air of 
condescension and found them most enjoyable that year two marriages had come of these balls 
the two pretty young princesses gorchakóv met suitors there and were married and so further 
increased the fame of these dances what distinguished them from others was the absence of 
host or hostess and the presence of the good natured iogel flying about like a 
feather and bowing according to the rules of his art as he collected the tickets 
from all his visitors there was the fact that only those came who wished to 
dance and amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long 
dresses for the first time with scarcely any exceptions they all were or seemed to 
be rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes sometimes the best of the 
pupils of whom natásha who was exceptionally graceful was first even danced the pas de 
châle but at this last ball only the écossaise the anglaise and the mazurka which 
was just coming into fashion were danced iogel had taken a ballroom in house and 
the ball as everyone said was a great success there were many pretty girls and 
the rostóv girls were among the prettiest they were both particularly happy and gay that 
evening proud of proposal her refusal and her explanation with nicholas sónya twirled about before 
she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited and she 
was transparently radiant with impulsive joy natásha no less proud of her first long dress 
and of being at a real ball was even happier they were both dressed in 
white muslin with pink ribbons natásha fell in love the very moment she entered the 
ballroom she was not in love with anyone in particular but with everyone whatever person 
she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment how delightful 
it is she kept saying running up to sónya nicholas and denísov were walking up 
and down looking with kindly patronage at the dancers sweet she will be a weal 
beauty said denísov natásha answered denísov how she dances what gwace he said again after 
a pause are you talking about your sister ejaculated denísov testily rostóv smiled dear count 
you were one of my best must dance said little iogel coming up to nicholas 
how many charming young he turned with the same request to denísov who was also 
a former pupil of his my dear fellow be a wallflower said denísov you wecollect 
what bad use i made of your lessons no said iogel hastening to reassure him 
were only inattentive but you had yes you had talent the band struck up the 
newly introduced mazurka nicholas could not refuse iogel and asked sónya to dance denísov sat 
down by the old ladies and leaning on his saber and beating time with his 
foot told them something funny and kept them amused while he watched the young people 
dancing iogel with natásha his pride and his best pupil were the first couple noiselessly 
skillfully stepping with his little feet in low shoes iogel flew first across the hall 
with natásha who though shy went on carefully executing her steps denísov did not take 
his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly 
indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not 
because he could not in the middle of a figure he beckoned to rostóv who 
was passing is not at all the thing he said sort of polish mazuwka is 
this but she does dance splendidly knowing that denísov had a reputation even in poland 
for the masterly way in which he danced the mazurka nicholas ran up to natásha 
and choose denísov he is a real dancer a wonder he said when it came 
to turn to choose a partner she rose and tripping rapidly across in her little 
shoes trimmed with bows ran timidly to the corner where denísov sat she saw that 
everybody was looking at her and waiting nicholas saw that denísov was refusing though he 
smiled delightedly he ran up to them vasíli dmítrich natásha was saying come no let 
me off countess denísov replied then váska said nicholas coax me as if i were 
váska the cat said denísov jokingly sing for you a whole evening said natásha the 
faiwy she can do anything with me said denísov and he unhooked his saber he 
came out from behind the chairs clasped his hand firmly threw back his head and 
advanced his foot waiting for the beat only on horse back and in the mazurka 
was short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to 
be at the right beat of the music he looked sideways at his partner with 
a merry and triumphant air suddenly stamped with one foot bounded from the floor like 
a ball and flew round the room taking his partner with him he glided silently 
on one foot half across the room and seeming not to notice the chairs was 
dashing straight at them when suddenly clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs he 
stopped short on his heels stood so a second stamped on the spot clanking his 
spurs whirled rapidly round and striking his left heel against his right flew round again 
in a circle natásha guessed what he meant to do and abandoning herself to him 
followed his lead hardly knowing how first he spun her round holding her now with 
his left now with his right hand then falling on one knee he twirled her 
round him and again jumping up dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if 
he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath and then he 
suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps when at last smartly whirling his 
partner round in front of her chair he drew up with a click of his 
spurs and bowed to her natásha did not even make him a curtsy she fixed 
her eyes on him in amazement smiling as if she did not recognize him does 
this mean she brought out although iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real 
mazurka everyone was delighted with skill he was asked again and again as a partner 
and the old men began smilingly to talk about poland and the good old days 
denísov flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself with his handkerchief sat down by natásha 
and did not leave her for the rest of the evening chapter xiii for two 
days after that rostóv did not see dólokhov at his own or at home on 
the third day he received a note from him as i do not intend to 
be at your house again for reasons you know of and am going to rejoin 
my regiment i am giving a farewell supper tonight to my to the english hotel 
about ten rostóv went to the english hotel straight from the theater where he had 
been with his family and denísov he was at once shown to the best room 
which dólokhov had taken for that evening some twenty men were gathered round a table 
at which dólokhov sat between two candles on the table was a pile of gold 
and paper money and he was keeping the bank rostóv had not seen him since 
his proposal and refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet 
clear cold glance met rostóv as soon as he entered the door as though he 
had long expected him a long time since we met he said for coming just 
finish dealing and then ilyúshka will come with his chorus called once or twice at 
your house said rostóv reddening dólokhov made no reply may punt he said rostóv recalled 
at that moment a strange conversation he had once had with dólokhov but fools trust 
to luck in play dólokhov had then said are you afraid to play with me 
dólokhov now asked as if guessing thought beneath his smile rostóv saw in him the 
mood he had shown at the club dinner and at other times when as if 
tired of everyday life he had felt a need to escape from it by some 
strange and usually cruel action rostóv felt ill at ease he tried but failed to 
find some joke with which to reply to words but before he had thought of 
anything dólokhov looking straight in his face said slowly and deliberately so that everyone could 
hear you remember we had a talk about cards a fool who trusts to luck 
one should make certain and i want to try try his luck or the certainty 
rostóv asked himself better not play dólokhov added and springing a new pack of cards 
said gentlemen moving the money forward he prepared to deal rostóv sat down by his 
side and at first did not play dólokhov kept glancing at him you play he 
asked and strange to say nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a 
card putting a small stake on it and beginning to play have no money with 
me he said trust you rostóv staked five rubles on a card and lost staked 
again and again lost dólokhov that is beat ten cards of running said dólokhov after 
he had dealt for some time place your money on the cards or i may 
get muddled in the reckoning one of the players said he hoped he might be 
trusted you might but i am afraid of getting the accounts mixed so i ask 
you to put the money on your cards replied dólokhov stint yourself settle afterwards he 
added turning to rostóv the game continued a waiter kept handing round champagne all cards 
were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up against him he wrote on 
a card but while the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered 
it to his usual stake of twenty rubles it said dólokhov though he did not 
seem to be even looking at rostóv win it back all the sooner i lose 
to the others but win from you or are you afraid of me he asked 
again rostóv submitted he let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven of 
hearts with a torn corner which he had picked up from the floor he well 
remembered that seven afterwards he laid down the seven of hearts on which with a 
broken bit of chalk he had written in clear upright figures he emptied the glass 
of warm champagne that was handed him smiled at words and with a sinking heart 
waiting for a seven to turn up gazed at hands which held the pack much 
depended on winning or losing on that seven of hearts on the previous sunday the 
old count had given his son two thousand rubles and though he always disliked speaking 
of money difficulties had told nicholas that this was all he could let him have 
till may and asked him to be more economical this time nicholas had replied that 
it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his word of 
honor not to take anything more till the spring now only twelve hundred rubles was 
left of that money so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only 
the loss of sixteen hundred rubles but the necessity of going back on his word 
with a sinking heart he watched hands and thought then make haste and let me 
have this card and take my cap and drive home to supper with denísov natásha 
and sónya and will certainly never touch a card again at that moment his home 
life jokes with pétya talks with sónya duets with natásha piquet with his father and 
even his comfortable bed in the house on the povarskáya rose before him with such 
vividness clearness and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and 
unappreciated bliss long past he could not conceive that a stupid chance letting the seven 
be dealt to the right rather than to the left might deprive him of all 
this happiness newly appreciated and newly illumined and plunge him into the depths of unknown 
and undefined misery that could not be yet he awaited with a sinking heart the 
movement of hands those broad reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt 
cuffs laid down the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were 
handed him you are not afraid to play with me repeated dólokhov and as if 
about to tell a good story he put down the cards leaned back in his 
chair and began deliberately with a smile gentlemen been told a rumor going about moscow 
that a sharper so i advise you to be careful now deal exclaimed rostóv those 
moscow gossips said dólokhov and he took up the cards with a smile rostóv almost 
screamed lifting both hands to his head the seven he needed was lying uppermost the 
first card in the pack he had lost more than he could pay ruin yourself 
said dólokhov with a side glance at rostóv as he continued to deal chapter xiv 
an hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested in 
their own play the whole interest was concentrated on rostóv instead of sixteen hundred rubles 
he had a long column of figures scored against him which he had reckoned up 
to ten thousand but that now as he vaguely supposed must have risen to fifteen 
thousand in reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles dólokhov was no longer listening to 
stories or telling them but followed every movement of hands and occasionally ran his eyes 
over the score against him he had decided to play until that score reached forty 
three thousand he had fixed on that number because forty three was the sum of 
his and joint ages rostóv leaning his head on both hands sat at the table 
which was scrawled over with figures wet with spilled wine and littered with cards one 
tormenting impression did not leave him that those broad boned reddish hands with hairy wrists 
visible from under the shirt sleeves those hands which he loved and hated held him 
in their power hundred rubles ace a corner a nine winning it impossible oh how 
pleasant it was at home the knave double or quits it be and why is 
he doing this to me rostóv pondered sometimes he staked a large sum but dólokhov 
refused to accept it and fixed the stake himself nicholas submitted to him and at 
one moment prayed to god as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge 
over the enns and then guessed that the card that came first to hand from 
the crumpled heap under the table would save him now counted the cords on his 
coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the total of his 
losses on it then he looked round for aid from the other players or peered 
at the now cold face of dólokhov and tried to read what was passing in 
his mind knows of course what this loss means to me he want my ruin 
he my friend i fond of him but not his fault he to do if 
he has such luck and not my fault either he thought to himself have done 
nothing wrong have i killed anyone or insulted or wished harm to anyone why such 
a terrible misfortune and when did it begin such a little while ago i came 
to this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket 
for name day and then going home i was so happy so free so lighthearted 
and i did not realize how happy i was when did that end and when 
did this new terrible state of things begin what marked the change i sat all 
the time in this same place at this table chose and placed cards and watched 
those broad boned agile hands in the same way when did it happen and what 
has happened i am well and strong and still the same and in the same 
place no it be surely it will all end in nothing he was flushed and 
bathed in perspiration though the room was not hot his face was terrible and piteous 
to see especially from its helpless efforts to seem calm the score against him reached 
the fateful sum of forty three thousand rostóv had just prepared a card by bending 
the corner of which he meant to double the three thousand just put down to 
his score when dólokhov slamming down the pack of cards put it aside and began 
rapidly adding up the total of debt breaking the chalk as he marked the figures 
in his clear bold hand time for supper and here are the gypsies some swarthy 
men and women were really entering from the cold outside and saying something in their 
gypsy accents nicholas understood that it was all over but he said in an indifferent 
tone you go on i had a splendid card all ready as if it were 
the fun of the game which interested him most all up lost thought he a 
bullet through my all left me and at the same time he said in a 
cheerful voice now just this one more little card right said dólokhov having finished the 
addition right twenty one rubles he said pointing to the figure twenty one by which 
the total exceeded the round sum of forty three thousand and taking up a pack 
he prepared to deal rostóv submissively unbent the corner of his card and instead of 
the six thousand he had intended carefully wrote twenty one all the same to me 
he said only want to see whether you will let me win this ten or 
beat it dólokhov began to deal seriously oh how rostóv detested at that moment those 
hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists which held him in their power 
the ten fell to him owe forty three thousand count said dólokhov and stretching himself 
he rose from the table does get tired sitting so long he added tired too 
said rostóv dólokhov cut him short as if to remind him that it was not 
for him to jest am i to receive the money count rostóv flushing drew dólokhov 
into the next room cannot pay it all immediately will you take an i o 
u he said say rostóv said dólokhov clearly smiling and looking nicholas straight in the 
eyes know the saying in love unlucky at cards your cousin is in love with 
you i know terrible to feel oneself so in this power thought rostóv he knew 
what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother by the news of 
this loss he knew what a relief it would be to escape it all and 
felt that dólokhov knew that he could save him from all this shame and sorrow 
but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a mouse cousin 
dólokhov started to say but nicholas interrupted him cousin has nothing to do with this 
and not necessary to mention her he exclaimed fiercely when am i to have it 
replied rostóv and left the room chapter xv to say and keep up a dignified 
tone was not difficult but to go home alone see his sisters brother mother and 
father confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word 
of honor was terrible at home they had not yet gone to bed the young 
people after returning from the theater had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord 
as soon as nicholas entered he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of love which 
pervaded the rostóv household that winter and now after proposal and ball seemed to have 
grown thicker round sónya and natásha as the air does before a thunderstorm sónya and 
natásha in the light blue dresses they had worn at the theater looking pretty and 
conscious of it were standing by the clavichord happy and smiling véra was playing chess 
with shinshín in the drawing room the old countess waiting for the return of her 
husband and son sat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house 
denísov with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair sat at the clavichord striking chords with his 
short fingers his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang with his 
small husky but true voice some verses called which he had composed and to which 
he was trying to fit music enchantress say to my forsaken lyre what magic power 
is this recalls me still what spark has set my inmost soul on fire what 
is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill he was singing in passionate tones gazing 
with his sparkling black agate eyes at the frightened and happy natásha excellent exclaimed natásha 
verse she said without noticing nicholas still the same with them thought nicholas glancing into 
the drawing room where he saw véra and his mother with the old lady and 
nicholas cried natásha running up to him papa at home he asked am so glad 
come said natásha without answering him are enjoying ourselves vasíli dmítrich is staying a day 
longer for my sake did you know papa is not back yet said sónya have 
you come come here dear called the old countess from the drawing room nicholas went 
to her kissed her hand and sitting down silently at her table began to watch 
her hands arranging the cards from the dancing room they still heard the laughter and 
merry voices trying to persuade natásha to sing wight all wight shouted denísov no good 
making excuses now your turn to sing the entweat you the countess glanced at her 
silent son is the matter she asked nothing said he as if weary of being 
continually asked the same question papa be back soon expect so the same with them 
they know nothing about it where am i to go thought nicholas and went again 
into the dancing room where the clavichord stood sónya was sitting at the clavichord playing 
the prelude to favorite barcarolle natásha was preparing to sing denísov was looking at her 
with enraptured eyes nicholas began pacing up and down the room do they want to 
make her sing how can she sing nothing to be happy about thought he sónya 
struck the first chord of the prelude god a ruined and dishonored man a bullet 
through my brain is the only thing left singing his thoughts ran on away but 
where to them sing he continued to pace the room looking gloomily at denísov and 
the girls and avoiding their eyes what is the matter eyes fixed on him seemed 
to ask she noticed at once that something had happened to him nicholas turned away 
from her natásha too with her quick instinct had instantly noticed her condition but though 
she noticed it she was herself in such high spirits at that moment so far 
from sorrow sadness or self reproach that she purposely deceived herself as young people often 
do i am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy with sorrow she 
felt and she said to herself i must be mistaken he must be feeling happy 
just as i am sónya she said going to the very middle of the room 
where she considered the resonance was best having lifted her head and let her arms 
droop lifelessly as ballet dancers do natásha rising energetically from her heels to her toes 
stepped to the middle of the room and stood still me she seemed to say 
answering the rapt gaze with which denísov followed her what is she so pleased about 
thought nicholas looking at his sister she dull and ashamed natásha took the first note 
her throat swelled her chest rose her eyes became serious at that moment she was 
oblivious of her surroundings and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may produce 
at the same intervals and hold for the same time but which leave you cold 
a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill you and make you weep 
natásha that winter had for the first time begun to sing seriously mainly because denísov 
so delighted in her singing she no longer sang as a child there was no 
longer in her singing that comical childish painstaking effect that had been in it before 
but she did not yet sing well as all the connoisseurs who heard her said 
is not trained but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained only they 
generally said this some time after she had finished singing while that untrained voice with 
its incorrect breathing and labored transitions was sounding even the connoisseurs said nothing but only 
delighted in it and wished to hear it again in her voice there was a 
virginal freshness an unconsciousness of her own powers and an as yet untrained velvety softness 
which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that it seemed as if 
nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling it is this thought nicholas listening 
to her with widely opened eyes has happened to her how she is singing today 
and suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note the 
next phrase and everything in the world was divided into three beats mio crudele affetto 
one two three one two three one mio crudele affetto one two three one this 
senseless life of ours thought nicholas this misery and money and dólokhov and anger and 
all nonsense but this is real now then natásha now then dearest now then darling 
how will she take that si taken it thank god and without noticing that he 
was singing to strengthen the si he sung a second a third below the high 
note god how fine did i really take it how fortunate he thought oh how 
that chord vibrated and how moved was something that was finest in soul and this 
something was apart from everything else in the world and above everything in the world 
were losses and dólokhov and words of honor all nonsense one might kill and rob 
and yet be happy chapter xvi it was long since rostóv had felt such enjoyment 
from music as he did that day but no sooner had natásha finished her barcarolle 
than reality again presented itself he got up without saying a word and went downstairs 
to his own room a quarter of an hour later the old count came in 
from his club cheerful and contented nicholas hearing him drive up went to meet him 
a good time said the old count smiling gaily and proudly at his son nicholas 
tried to say but could not and he nearly burst into sobs the count was 
lighting his pipe and did not notice his condition it be avoided thought nicholas for 
the first and last time and suddenly in the most casual tone which made him 
feel ashamed of himself he said as if merely asking his father to let him 
have the carriage to drive to town i have come on a matter of business 
i was nearly forgetting i need some money me said his father who was in 
a specially good humor told you it would not be enough how much much said 
nicholas flushing and with a stupid careless smile for which he was long unable to 
forgive himself have lost a little i mean a good deal a great three thousand 
to whom nonsense cried the count suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and 
nape as old people do promised to pay tomorrow said nicholas said the old count 
spreading out his arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa be helped it happens to 
everyone said the son with a bold free and easy tone while in his soul 
he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his 
crime he longed to kiss his hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness but said 
in a careless and even rude voice that it happens to everyone the old count 
cast down his eyes on hearing his words and began bustlingly searching for something yes 
he muttered will be difficult i fear difficult to raise happens to everybody yes who 
has not done it and with a furtive glance at his face the count went 
out of the room nicholas had been prepared for resistance but had not at all 
expected this pa pa he called after him sobbing me and seizing his hand he 
pressed it to his lips and burst into tears while father and son were having 
their explanation the mother and daughter were having one not less important natásha came running 
to her mother quite excited mamma he has made me what made me an offer 
mamma mamma she exclaimed the countess did not believe her ears denísov had proposed to 
whom to this chit of a girl natásha who not so long ago was playing 
with dolls and who was still having lessons natásha what nonsense she said hoping it 
was a joke indeed i am telling you the fact said natásha indignantly come to 
ask you what to do and you call it the countess shrugged her shoulders it 
is true that monsieur denísov has made you a proposal tell him he is a 
fool all not a fool replied natásha indignantly and seriously then what do you want 
all in love nowadays well if you are in love marry him said the countess 
with a laugh of annoyance luck to you mamma not in love with him i 
suppose not in love with him then tell him so are you cross be cross 
dear is it my fault but what is it my dear do you want me 
to go and tell him said the countess smiling i will do it myself only 
tell me what to say all very well for you said natásha with a responsive 
smile should have seen how he said it i know he did not mean to 
say it but it came out accidently all the same you must refuse him i 
i am so sorry for him so nice then accept his offer high time for 
you to be married answered the countess sharply and sarcastically mamma but so sorry for 
him i know how to say it nothing for you to say i shall speak 
to him myself said the countess indignant that they should have dared to treat this 
little natásha as grown up not on any account i will tell him myself and 
listen at the door and natásha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall 
where denísov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord with his face in 
his hands he jumped up at the sound of her light step he said moving 
with rapid steps toward her my fate it is in your hands dmítrich so sorry 
for you no but you are so nice but it do not that but as 
a friend i shall always love you denísov bent over her hand and she heard 
strange sounds she did not understand she kissed his rough curly black head at this 
instant they heard the quick rustle of the dress she came up to them dmítrich 
i thank you for the honor she said with an embarrassed voice though it sounded 
severe to my daughter is so young and i thought that as my friend you 
would have addressed yourself first to me in that case you would not have obliged 
me to give this refusal said denísov with downcast eyes and a guilty face he 
tried to say more but faltered natásha could not remain calm seeing him in such 
a plight she began to sob aloud i have done denísov went on in an 
unsteady voice believe me i so adore your daughter and all your family that i 
would give my life twice over he looked at the countess and seeing her severe 
face said good by countess and kissing her hand he left the room with quick 
resolute strides without looking at natásha next day rostóv saw denísov off he did not 
wish to stay another day in moscow all moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment 
at the with the result that he had no recollection of how he was put 
in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey after departure rostóv 
spent another fortnight in moscow without going out of the house waiting for the money 
his father could not at once raise and he spent most of his time in 
the room sónya was more tender and devoted to him than ever it was as 
if she wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her 
love him all the more but nicholas now considered himself unworthy of her he filled 
the albums with verses and music and having at last sent dólokhov the whole forty 
three thousand rubles and received his receipt he left at the end of november without 
taking leave of any of his acquaintances to overtake his regiment which was already in 
poland book five 1806 07 chapter i after his interview with his wife pierre left 
for petersburg at the torzhók post station either there were no horses or the postmaster 
would not supply them pierre was obliged to wait without undressing he lay down on 
the leather sofa in front of a round table put his big feet in their 
overboots on the table and began to reflect you have the portmanteaus brought in and 
a bed got ready and tea asked his valet pierre gave no answer for he 
neither heard nor saw anything he had begun to think of the last station and 
was still pondering on the same so important that he took no notice of what 
went on around him not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to 
petersburg earlier or later or whether he secured accommodation at this station but compared to 
the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter of indifference whether he remained 
there for a few hours or for the rest of his life the postmaster his 
wife the valet and a peasant woman selling torzhók embroidery came into the room offering 
their services without changing his careless attitude pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable 
to understand what they wanted or how they could go on living without having solved 
the problems that so absorbed him he had been engrossed by the same thoughts ever 
since the day he returned from sokólniki after the duel and had spent that first 
agonizing sleepless night but now in the solitude of the journey they seized him with 
special force no matter what he thought about he always returned to these same questions 
which he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself it was 
as if the thread of the chief screw which held his life together were stripped 
so that the screw could not get in or out but went on turning uselessly 
in the same place the postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency 
to wait only two hours when come what might he would let his excellency have 
the courier horses it was plain that he was lying and only wanted to get 
more money from the traveler this good or bad pierre asked himself is good for 
me bad for another traveler and for himself unavoidable because he needs money for food 
the man said an officer had once given him a thrashing for letting a private 
traveler have the courier horses but the officer thrashed him because he had to get 
on as quickly as possible and i continued pierre dólokhov because i considered myself injured 
and louis xvi was executed because they considered him a criminal and a year later 
they executed those who executed for some reason what is bad what is good what 
should one love and what hate what does one live for and what am i 
what is life and what is death what power governs all there was no answer 
to any of these questions except one and that not a logical answer and not 
at all a reply to them the answer was die and all will end die 
and know all or cease asking but dying was also dreadful the torzhók peddler woman 
in a whining voice went on offering her wares especially a pair of goatskin slippers 
have hundreds of rubles i know what to do with and she stands in her 
tattered cloak looking timidly at me he thought what does she want the money for 
as if that money could add a breadth to happiness or peace of mind can 
anything in the world make her or me less a prey to evil and death 
which ends all and must come today or any rate in an instant as compared 
with eternity and again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread and again it 
turned uselessly in the same place his servant handed him a half cut novel in 
the form of letters by madame de souza he began reading about the sufferings and 
virtuous struggles of a certain emilie de mansfeld why did she resist her seducer when 
she loved him he thought could not have put into her heart an impulse that 
was against his will my she once not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing 
has been found out nothing discovered pierre again said to himself we can know is 
that we know nothing and the height of human wisdom everything within and around him 
seemed confused senseless and repellent yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances pierre 
found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction make bold to ask your excellency to move a 
little for this gentleman said the postmaster entering the room followed by another traveler also 
detained for lack of horses the newcomer was a short large boned yellow faced wrinkled 
old man with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite grayish color pierre 
took his feet off the table stood up and lay down on a bed that 
had been got ready for him glancing now and then at the newcomer who with 
a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with the aid of 
his servant and not looking at pierre with a pair of felt boots on his 
thin bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeen covered sheepskin coat the traveler sat 
down on the sofa leaned back his big head with its broad temples and close 
cropped hair and looked at bezúkhov the stern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look 
struck pierre he felt a wish to speak to the stranger but by the time 
he had made up his mind to ask him a question about the roads the 
traveler had closed his eyes his shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger 
of one of them pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing 
a head the stranger sat without stirring either resting or as it seemed to pierre 
sunk in profound and calm meditation his servant was also a yellow wrinkled old man 
without beard or mustache evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never 
grown this active old servant was unpacking the canteen and preparing tea he brought in 
a boiling samovar when everything was ready the stranger opened his eyes moved to the 
table filled a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man 
to whom he passed it pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and the 
need even the inevitability of entering into conversation with this stranger the servant brought back 
his tumbler turned upside down with an unfinished bit of nibbled sugar and asked if 
anything more would be wanted to indicate he did not want more tea give me 
the book said the stranger the servant handed him a book which pierre took to 
be a devotional work and the traveler became absorbed in it pierre looked at him 
all at once the stranger closed the book putting in a marker and again leaning 
with his arms on the back of the sofa sat in his former position with 
his eyes shut pierre looked at him and had not time to turn away when 
the old man opening his eyes fixed his steady and severe gaze straight on face 
pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look but the bright old eyes attracted 
him irresistibly chapter ii have the pleasure of addressing count bezúkhov if i am not 
mistaken said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice pierre looked silently and inquiringly 
at him over his spectacles have heard of you my dear sir continued the stranger 
of your misfortune he seemed to emphasize the last word as if to misfortune call 
it what you please i know that what happened to you in moscow was a 
misfortune regret it very much my dear sir pierre flushed and hurriedly putting his legs 
down from the bed bent forward toward the old man with a forced and timid 
smile have not referred to this out of curiosity my dear sir but for greater 
reasons he paused his gaze still on pierre and moved aside on the sofa by 
way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him pierre felt reluctant to 
enter into conversation with this old man but submitting to him involuntarily came up and 
sat down beside him are unhappy my dear sir the stranger continued are young and 
i am old i should like to help you as far as lies in my 
power yes said pierre with a forced smile am very grateful to you where are 
you traveling from the face was not genial it was even cold and severe but 
in spite of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance were irresistibly 
attractive to pierre if for any reason you feel inclined to talk to me said 
the old man so my dear sir and he suddenly smiled in an unexpected and 
tenderly paternal way no not at all on the contrary i am very glad to 
make your acquaintance said pierre and again glancing at the hands he looked more closely 
at the ring with its masonic sign me to ask he said you a mason 
i belong to the brotherhood of the freemasons said the stranger looking deeper and deeper 
into eyes in their name and my own i hold out a brotherly hand to 
you am afraid said pierre smiling and wavering between the confidence the personality of the 
freemason inspired in him and his own habit of ridiculing the masonic am afraid i 
am very far from am i to put it am afraid my way of looking 
at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another 
know your outlook said the mason the view of life you mention and which you 
think is the result of your own mental efforts is the one held by the 
majority of people and is the invariable fruit of pride indolence and ignorance forgive me 
my dear sir but if i had not known it i should not have addressed 
you your view of life is a regrettable delusion as i may suppose you to 
be deluded said pierre with a faint smile should never dare to say that i 
know the truth said the mason whose words struck pierre more and more by their 
precision and firmness one can attain to truth by himself only by laying stone on 
stone with the cooperation of all by the millions of generations from our forefather adam 
to our own times is that temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling 
place of the great god he added and closed his eyes ought to tell you 
that i do not believe do not believe in god said pierre regretfully and with 
an effort feeling it essential to speak the whole truth the mason looked intently at 
pierre and smiled as a rich man with millions in hand might smile at a 
poor fellow who told him that he poor man had not the five rubles that 
would make him happy you do not know him my dear sir said the mason 
cannot know him you do not know him and that is why you are unhappy 
yes i am unhappy assented pierre what am i to do know him not my 
dear sir and so you are very unhappy you do not know him but he 
is here he is in me he is in my words he is in thee 
and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered pronounced the mason in a 
stern and tremulous voice he paused and sighed evidently trying to calm himself he were 
not he said quietly and i would not be speaking of him my dear sir 
of what of whom are we speaking whom hast thou denied he suddenly asked with 
exulting austerity and authority in his voice invented him if he did not exist whence 
came thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible being didst thou and why 
did the whole world conceive the idea of the existence of such an incomprehensible being 
a being all powerful eternal and infinite in all his attributes he stopped and remained 
silent for a long time pierre could not and did not wish to break this 
silence exists but to understand him is hard the mason began again looking not at 
pierre but straight before him and turning the leaves of his book with his old 
hands which from excitement he could not keep still it were a man whose existence 
thou didst doubt i could bring him to thee could take him by the hand 
and show him to thee but how can i an insignificant mortal show his omnipotence 
his infinity and all his mercy to one who is blind or who shuts his 
eyes that he may not see or understand him and may not see or understand 
his own vileness and sinfulness he paused again art thou thou dreamest that thou art 
wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words he went on with a somber and 
scornful smile thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little child who playing with 
the parts of a skillfully made watch dares to say that as he does not 
understand its use he does not believe in the master who made it to know 
him is hard for ages from our forefather adam to our own day we labor 
to attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim but in our 
lack of understanding we see only our weakness and his greatness pierre listened with swelling 
heart gazing into the face with shining eyes not interrupting or questioning him but believing 
with his whole soul what the stranger said whether he accepted the wise reasoning contained 
in the words or believed as a child believes in the tone of conviction and 
earnestness or the tremor of the sometimes almost those brilliant aged eyes grown old in 
this conviction or the calm firmness and certainty of his vocation which radiated from his 
whole being and which struck pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and hopelessness 
any rate pierre longed with his whole soul to believe and he did believe and 
felt a joyful sense of comfort regeneration and return to life is not to be 
apprehended by reason but by life said the mason do not understand said pierre feeling 
with dismay doubts reawakening he was afraid of any want of clearness any weakness in 
the arguments he dreaded not to be able to believe in him understand he said 
it is that the mind of man cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak 
the mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile highest wisdom and truth are like the 
purest liquid we may wish to imbibe he said i receive that pure liquid into 
an impure vessel and judge of its purity only by the inner purification of myself 
can i retain in some degree of purity the liquid i receive yes that is 
so said pierre joyfully highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone not on those 
worldly sciences of physics history chemistry and the like into which intellectual knowledge is divided 
the highest wisdom is one the highest wisdom has but one science of the science 
explaining the whole creation and place in it to receive that science it is necessary 
to purify and renew inner self and so before one can know it is necessary 
to believe and to perfect self and to attain this end we have the light 
called conscience that god has implanted in our souls yes assented pierre then at thy 
inner self with the eyes of the spirit and ask thyself whether thou art content 
with thyself what hast thou attained relying on reason only what art thou you are 
young you are rich you are clever you are well educated and what have you 
done with all these good gifts are you content with yourself and with your life 
i hate my life pierre muttered wincing hatest it then change it purify thyself and 
as thou art purified thou wilt gain wisdom look at your life my dear sir 
how have you spent it in riotous orgies and debauchery receiving everything from society and 
giving nothing in return you have become the possessor of wealth how have you used 
it what have you done for your neighbor have you ever thought of your tens 
of thousands of slaves have you helped them physically and morally no you have profited 
by their toil to lead a profligate life that is what you have done have 
you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your neighbor no 
you have spent your life in idleness then you married my dear on yourself responsibility 
for the guidance of a young woman and what have you done you have not 
helped her to find the way of truth my dear sir but have thrust her 
into an abyss of deceit and misery a man offended you and you shot him 
and you say you do not know god and hate your life there is nothing 
strange in that my dear sir after these words the mason as if tired by 
his long discourse again leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed 
his eyes pierre looked at that aged stern motionless almost lifeless face and moved his 
lips without uttering a sound he wished to say a vile idle vicious life but 
dared not break the silence the mason cleared his throat huskily as old men do 
and called his servant about the horses he asked without looking at pierre exchange horses 
have just come answered the servant you not rest here tell them to harness he 
really be going away leaving me alone without having told me all and without promising 
to help me thought pierre rising with downcast head and he began to pace the 
room glancing occasionally at the mason i never thought of it but i have led 
a contemptible and profligate life though i did not like it and did not want 
to thought pierre this man knows the truth and if he wished to could disclose 
it to me pierre wished to say this to the mason but did not dare 
to the traveler having packed his things with his practiced hands began fastening his coat 
when he had finished he turned to bezúkhov and said in a tone of indifferent 
politeness are you going to now my dear sir going to petersburg answered pierre in 
a childlike hesitating voice thank you i agree with all you have said but do 
not suppose me to be so bad with my whole soul i wish to be 
what you would have me be but i have never had help from anyone but 
it is i above all who am to blame for everything help me teach me 
and perhaps i may pierre could not go on he gulped and turned away the 
mason remained silent for a long time evidently considering comes from god alone he said 
such measure of help as our order can bestow it will render you my dear 
sir you are going to petersburg hand this to count he took out his notebook 
and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four me 
to give you a piece of advice when you reach the capital first of all 
devote some time to solitude and self examination and do not resume your former way 
of life and now i wish you a good journey my dear sir he added 
seeing that his servant had entered success the traveler was joseph alexéevich bazdéev as pierre 
saw from the book bazdéev had been one of the best known freemasons and martinists 
even in time for a long while after he had gone pierre did not go 
to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room pondering over his 
vicious past and with a rapturous sense of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful 
irreproachable virtuous future that seemed to him so easy it seemed to him that he 
had been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be 
virtuous not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul he firmly believed 
in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supporting one 
another in the path of virtue and that is how freemasonry presented itself to him 
chapter iii on reaching petersburg pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival he 
went nowhere and spent whole days in reading thomas à kempis whose book had been 
sent him by someone unknown one thing he continually realized as he read that book 
the joy hitherto unknown to him of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection and 
in the possibility of active brotherly love among men which joseph alexéevich had revealed to 
him a week after his arrival the young polish count willarski whom pierre had known 
slightly in petersburg society came into his room one evening in the official and ceremonious 
manner in which second had called on him and having closed the door behind him 
and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room addressed pierre have come 
to you with a message and an offer count he said without sitting down person 
of very high standing in our brotherhood has made application for you to be received 
into our order before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your 
sponsor i consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that wishes do you wish to 
enter the brotherhood of freemasons under my sponsorship the cold austere tone of this man 
whom he had almost always before met at balls amiably smiling in the society of 
the most brilliant women surprised pierre i do wish it said he willarski bowed his 
head more question count he said i beg you to answer in all as a 
future mason but as an honest man have you renounced your former you believe in 
god pierre considered yes i believe in god he said that case began willarski but 
pierre interrupted him i do believe in god he repeated that case we can go 
said willarski carriage is at your service willarski was silent throughout the drive to inquiries 
as to what he must do and how he should answer willarski only replied that 
brothers more worthy than he would test him and that pierre had only to tell 
the truth having entered the courtyard of a large house where the lodge had its 
headquarters and having ascended a dark staircase they entered a small well lit anteroom where 
they took off their cloaks without the aid of a servant from there they passed 
into another room a man in strange attire appeared at the door willarski stepping toward 
him said something to him in french in an undertone and then went up to 
a small wardrobe in which pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen before 
having taken a kerchief from the cupboard willarski bound eyes with it and tied it 
in a knot behind catching some hairs painfully in the knot then he drew his 
face down kissed him and taking him by the hand led him forward the hairs 
tied in the knot hurt pierre and there were lines of pain on his face 
and a shamefaced smile his huge figure with arms hanging down and with a puckered 
though smiling face moved after willarski with uncertain timid steps having led him about ten 
paces willarski stopped happens to you he said must bear it all manfully if you 
have firmly resolved to join our brotherhood pierre nodded affirmatively you hear a knock at 
the door you will uncover your eyes added willarski wish you courage and success and 
pressing hand he went out left alone pierre went on smiling in the same way 
once or twice he shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief as 
if wishing to take it off but let it drop again the five minutes spent 
with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour his arms felt numb his legs 
almost gave way it seemed to him that he was tired out he experienced a 
variety of most complex sensations he felt afraid of what would happen to him and 
still more afraid of showing his fear he felt curious to know what was going 
to happen and what would be revealed to him but most of all he felt 
joyful that the moment had come when he would at last start on that path 
of regeneration and on the actively virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since 
he met joseph alexéevich loud knocks were heard at the door pierre took the bandage 
off his eyes and glanced around him the room was in black darkness only a 
small lamp was burning inside something white pierre went nearer and saw that the lamp 
stood on a black table on which lay an open book the book was the 
gospel and the white thing with the lamp inside was a human skull with its 
cavities and teeth after reading the first words of the gospel the beginning was the 
word and the word was with god pierre went round the table and saw a 
large open box filled with something it was a coffin with bones inside he was 
not at all surprised by what he saw hoping to enter on an entirely new 
life quite unlike the old one he expected everything to be unusual even more unusual 
than what he was seeing a skull a coffin the seemed to him that he 
had expected all this and even more trying to stimulate his emotions he looked around 
death love the brotherhood of man he kept saying to himself associating these words with 
vague yet joyful ideas the door opened and someone came in by the dim light 
to which pierre had already become accustomed he saw a rather short man having evidently 
come from the light into the darkness the man paused then moved with cautious steps 
toward the table and placed on it his small leather gloved hands this short man 
had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and part of his legs 
he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high white ruffle outlining 
his rather long face which was lit up from below what have you come hither 
asked the newcomer turning in direction at a slight rustle made by the latter have 
you who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not 
seen the light come here what do you seek from us wisdom virtue enlightenment at 
the moment the door opened and the stranger came in pierre felt a sense of 
awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at confession he felt 
himself in the presence of one socially a complete stranger yet nearer to him through 
the brotherhood of man with bated breath and beating heart he moved toward the rhetor 
by which name the brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the brotherhood was 
known drawing nearer he recognized in the rhetor a man he knew smolyanínov and it 
mortified him to think that the newcomer was an wished him simply a brother and 
a virtuous instructor for a long time he could not utter a word so that 
the rhetor had to repeat his question i i desire regeneration pierre uttered with difficulty 
well said smolyanínov and went on at once you any idea of the means by 
which our holy order will help you to reach your aim said he quietly and 
quickly hope for guidance help in regeneration said pierre with a trembling voice and some 
difficulty in utterance due to his excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract 
matters in russian is your conception of freemasonry imagine that freemasonry is the fraternity and 
equality of men who have virtuous aims said pierre feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of 
his words for the solemnity of the moment as he spoke imagine said the rhetor 
quickly apparently satisfied with this answer you sought for means of attaining your aim in 
religion i considered it erroneous and did not follow it said pierre so softly that 
the rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying have been 
an atheist answered pierre are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in 
your life therefore you seek wisdom and virtue is that not so said the rhetor 
after a pause yes assented pierre the rhetor cleared his throat crossed his gloved hands 
on his breast and began to speak i must disclose to you the chief aim 
of our order he said if this aim coincides with yours you may enter our 
brotherhood with profit the first and chief object of our order the foundation on which 
it rests and which no human power can destroy is the preservation and handing on 
to posterity of a certain important mystery which has come down to us from the 
remotest ages even from the first mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends 
but since this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use 
it unless he be prepared by long and diligent self purification not everyone can hope 
to attain it quickly hence we have a secondary aim that of preparing our members 
as much as possible to reform their hearts to purify and enlighten their minds by 
means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven to attain this 
mystery and thereby to render them capable of receiving it purifying and regenerating our members 
we try thirdly to improve the whole human race offering it in our members an 
example of piety and virtue and thereby try with all our might to combat the 
evil which sways the world think this over and i will come to you again 
combat the evil which sways the world pierre repeated and a mental image of his 
future activity in this direction rose in his mind he imagined men such as he 
had himself been a fortnight ago and he addressed an edifying exhortation to them he 
imagined to himself vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed 
imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue of the three objects mentioned by the rhetor 
this last that of improving mankind especially appealed to pierre the important mystery mentioned by 
the rhetor though it aroused his curiosity did not seem to him essential and the 
second aim that of purifying and regenerating himself did not much interest him because at 
that moment he felt with delight that he was already perfectly cured of his former 
faults and was ready for all that was good half an hour later the rhetor 
returned to inform the seeker of the seven virtues corresponding to the seven steps of 
temple which every freemason should cultivate in himself these virtues were 1 discretion the keeping 
of the secrets of the order 2 obedience to those of higher ranks in the 
order 3 morality 4 love of mankind 5 courage 6 generosity 7 the love of 
death the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death the rhetor said bring 
yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe but as a friend that frees 
the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this distressful life and leads 
it to its place of recompense and peace that must be so thought pierre when 
after these words the rhetor went away leaving him to solitary meditation must be so 
but i am still so weak that i love my life the meaning of which 
is only now gradually opening before me but five of the other virtues which pierre 
recalled counting them on his fingers he felt already in his soul courage generosity morality 
love of mankind and especially did not even seem to him a virtue but a 
joy he now felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to 
submit his will to those who knew the indubitable truth he forgot what the seventh 
virtue was and could not recall it the third time the rhetor came back more 
quickly and asked pierre whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to 
submit to all that would be required of him am ready for everything said pierre 
must also inform you said the rhetor our order delivers its teaching not in words 
only but also by other means which may perhaps have a stronger effect on the 
sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue than mere words this chamber with what you see 
therein should already have suggested to your heart if it is sincere more than words 
could do you will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like method of 
enlightenment our order imitates the ancient societies that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics a hieroglyph 
said the rhetor an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but which possesses 
qualities resembling those of the symbol pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was but 
dared not speak he listened to the rhetor in silence feeling from all he said 
that his ordeal was about to begin you are resolved i must begin your initiation 
said the rhetor coming closer to pierre token of generosity i ask you to give 
me all your valuables i have nothing here replied pierre supposing that he was asked 
to give up all he possessed you have with you watch money rings pierre quickly 
took out his purse and watch but could not manage for some time to get 
the wedding ring off his fat finger when that had been done the rhetor said 
token of obedience i ask you to undress pierre took off his coat waistcoat and 
left boot according to the instructions the mason drew the shirt back from left breast 
and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to above the knee 
pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also and was going to tuck up 
the other trouser leg to save this stranger the trouble but the mason told him 
that was not necessary and gave him a slipper for his left foot with a 
childlike smile of embarrassment doubt and self derision which appeared on his face against his 
will pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart before his brother rhetor 
and awaited his further commands now in token of candor i ask you to reveal 
to me your chief passion said the latter passion i have had so many replied 
pierre passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path of 
virtue said the mason pierre paused seeking a reply gluttony idleness laziness irritability anger women 
he went over his vices in his mind not knowing to which of them to 
give the pre eminence he said in a low scarcely audible voice the mason did 
not move and for a long time said nothing after this answer at last he 
moved up to pierre and taking the kerchief that lay on the table again bound 
his eyes the last time i say to all your attention upon yourself put a 
bridle on your senses and seek blessedness not in passion but in your own heart 
the source of blessedness is not without us but within pierre had already long been 
feeling in himself that refreshing source of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad 
emotion chapter iv soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch pierre 
not the rhetor but sponsor willarski whom he recognized by his voice to fresh questions 
as to the firmness of his resolution pierre replied yes i agree and with a 
beaming childlike smile his fat chest uncovered stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and 
one booted foot he advanced while willarski held a sword to his bare chest he 
was conducted from that room along passages that turned backwards and forwards and was at 
last brought to the doors of the lodge willarski coughed he was answered by the 
masonic knock with mallets the doors opened before them a bass voice pierre was still 
blindfolded questioned him as to who he was when and where he was born and 
so on then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded and as they went along 
he was told allegories of the toils of his pilgrimage of holy friendship of the 
eternal architect of the universe and of the courage with which he should endure toils 
and dangers during these wanderings pierre noticed that he was spoken of now as the 
now as the and now as the to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets 
and swords as he was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation 
and uncertainty among his conductors he heard those around him disputing in whispers and one 
of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet after that they 
took his right hand placed it on something and told him to hold a pair 
of compasses to his left breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone 
who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the laws of the order the candles 
were then extinguished and some spirit lighted as pierre knew by the smell and he 
was told that he would now see the lesser light the bandage was taken off 
his eyes and by the faint light of the burning spirit pierre as in a 
dream saw several men standing before him wearing aprons like the and holding swords in 
their hands pointed at his breast among them stood a man whose white shirt was 
stained with blood on seeing this pierre moved forward with his breast toward the swords 
meaning them to pierce it but the swords were drawn back from him and he 
was at once blindfolded again thou hast seen the lesser light uttered a voice then 
the candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light 
the bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together transit gloria mundi 
pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room and at the 
people in it round a long table covered with black sat some twelve men in 
garments like those he had already seen some of them pierre had met in petersburg 
society in the chair sat a young man he did not know with a peculiar 
cross hanging from his neck on his right sat the italian abbé whom pierre had 
met at anna two years before there were also present a very distinguished dignitary and 
a swiss who had formerly been tutor at the all maintained a solemn silence listening 
to the words of the president who held a mallet in his hand let into 
the wall was a star shaped light at one side of the table was a 
small carpet with various figures worked upon it at the other was something resembling an 
altar on which lay a testament and a skull round it stood seven large candlesticks 
like those used in churches two of the brothers led pierre up to the altar 
placed his feet at right angles and bade him lie down saying that he must 
prostrate himself at the gates of the temple must first receive the trowel whispered one 
of the brothers hush please said another pierre perplexed looked round with his shortsighted eyes 
without obeying and suddenly doubts arose in his mind am i what am i doing 
they laughing at me i be ashamed to remember this but these doubts only lasted 
a moment pierre glanced at the serious faces of those around remembered all he had 
already gone through and realized that he could not stop halfway he was aghast at 
his hesitation and trying to arouse his former devotional feeling prostrated himself before the gates 
of the temple and really the feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly 
than before when he had lain there some time he was told to get up 
and a white leather apron such as the others wore was put on him he 
was given a trowel and three pairs of gloves and then the grand master addressed 
him he told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness 
of that apron which symbolized strength and purity then of the unexplained trowel he told 
him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice and indulgently to 
smooth with it the heart of his neighbor as to the first pair of gloves 
a he said that pierre could not know their meaning but must keep them the 
second pair of gloves he was to wear at the meetings and finally of the 
third a pair of gloves he said brother these gloves are intended for you too 
give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all this gift will 
be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to be 
your worthy helpmeet in masonry and after a pause he added beware dear brother that 
these gloves do not deck hands that are unclean while the grand master said these 
last words it seemed to pierre that he grew embarrassed pierre himself grew still more 
confused blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes began looking about him 
uneasily and an awkward pause followed this silence was broken by one of the brethren 
who led pierre up to the rug and began reading to him from a manuscript 
book an explanation of all the figures on it the sun the moon a hammer 
a plumb line a trowel a rough stone and a squared stone a pillar three 
windows and so on then a place was assigned to pierre he was shown the 
signs of the lodge told the password and at last was permitted to sit down 
the grand master began reading the statutes they were very long and pierre from joy 
agitation and embarrassment was not in a state to understand what was being read he 
managed to follow only the last words of the statutes and these remained in his 
mind our temples we recognize no other distinctions read the grand master those between virtue 
and vice beware of making any distinctions which may infringe equality fly to a aid 
whoever he may be exhort him who goeth astray raise him that falleth never bear 
malice or enmity toward thy brother be kindly and courteous kindle in all hearts the 
flame of virtue share thy happiness with thy neighbor and may envy never dim the 
purity of that bliss forgive thy enemy do not avenge thyself except by doing him 
good thus fulfilling the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which 
thou hast lost he finished and getting up embraced and kissed pierre who with tears 
of joy in his eyes looked round him not knowing how to answer the congratulations 
and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all sides he acknowledged no acquaintances but 
saw in all these men only brothers and burned with impatience to set to work 
with them the grand master rapped with his mallet all the masons sat down in 
their places and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of humility the 
grand master proposed that the last duty should be performed and the distinguished dignitary who 
bore the title of of went round to all the brothers pierre would have liked 
to subscribe all he had but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the 
same amount as the others the meeting was at an end and on reaching home 
pierre felt as if he had returned from a long journey on which he had 
spent dozens of years had become completely changed and had quite left behind his former 
habits and way of life chapter v the day after he had been received into 
the lodge pierre was sitting at home reading a book and trying to fathom the 
significance of the square one side of which symbolized god another moral things a third 
physical things and the fourth a combination of these now and then his attention wandered 
from the book and the square and he formed in imagination a new plan of 
life on the previous evening at the lodge he had heard that a rumor of 
his duel had reached the emperor and that it would be wiser for him to 
leave petersburg pierre proposed going to his estates in the south and there attending to 
the welfare of his serfs he was joyfully planning this new life when prince vasíli 
suddenly entered the room dear fellow what have you been up to in moscow why 
have you quarreled with hélène mon cher you are under a delusion said prince vasíli 
as he entered know all about it and i can tell you positively that hélène 
is as innocent before you as christ was before the jews pierre was about to 
reply but prince vasíli interrupted him why you simply come straight to me as to 
a friend i know all about it and understand it all he said behaved as 
becomes a man who values his honor perhaps too hastily but we go into that 
but consider the position in which you are placing her and me in the eyes 
of society and even of the court he added lowering his voice is living in 
moscow and you are here remember dear boy and he drew arm downwards is simply 
a misunderstanding i expect you feel it so yourself let us write her a letter 
at once and come here and all will be explained or else my dear boy 
let me tell you quite likely have to suffer for it prince vasíli gave pierre 
a significant look know from reliable sources that the dowager empress is taking a keen 
interest in the whole affair you know she is very gracious to hélène pierre tried 
several times to speak but on one hand prince vasíli did not let him and 
on the other pierre himself feared to begin to speak in the tone of decided 
refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly resolved to answer his father in law 
moreover the words of the masonic statutes kindly and courteous recurred to him he blinked 
went red got up and sat down again struggling with himself to do what was 
for him the most difficult thing in say an unpleasant thing to a face to 
say what the other whoever he might be did not expect he was so used 
to submitting to prince tone of careless self assurance that he felt he would be 
unable to withstand it now but he also felt that on what he said now 
his future he would follow the same old road or that new path so attractively 
shown him by the masons on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to 
a new life dear boy said prince vasíli playfully and write to her myself and 
we will kill the fatted calf but before prince vasíli had finished his playful speech 
pierre without looking at him and with a kind of fury that made him like 
his father muttered in a whisper i did not ask you here go please go 
and he jumped up and opened the door for him he repeated amazed at himself 
and glad to see the look of confusion and fear that showed itself on prince 
face the matter with you are you ill the quivering voice repeated and prince vasíli 
had to go without receiving any explanation a week later pierre having taken leave of 
his new friends the masons and leaving large sums of money with them for alms 
went away to his estates his new brethren gave him letters to the kiev and 
odessa masons and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity 
chapter vi the duel between pierre and dólokhov was hushed up and in spite of 
the severity regarding duels at that time neither the principals nor their seconds suffered for 
it but the story of the duel confirmed by rupture with his wife was the 
talk of society pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an 
illegitimate son and petted and extolled when he was the best match in russia had 
sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his the marriageable daughters and their mothers 
had nothing to hope from as he did not know how and did not wish 
to court favor now he alone was blamed for what had happened he was said 
to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage and 
when after departure hélène returned to petersburg she was received by all her acquaintances not 
only cordially but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune when conversation 
turned on her husband hélène assumed a dignified expression which with characteristic tact she had 
acquired though she did not understand its significance this expression suggested that she had resolved 
to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband was a cross laid upon her 
by god prince vasíli expressed his opinion more openly he shrugged his shoulders when pierre 
was mentioned and pointing to his forehead remarked bit always said so said from the 
first declared anna pávlovna referring to pierre said at the time and before anyone she 
insisted on her priority that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of 
these days i said so even at the time when everybody was in raptures about 
him when he had just returned from abroad and when if you remember he posed 
as a sort of marat at one of my soirees and how has it ended 
i was against this marriage even then and foretold all that has happened anna pávlovna 
continued to give on free evenings the same kind of soirees as as she alone 
had the gift of which was to be found cream of really good society the 
bloom of the intellectual essence of petersburg as she herself put it besides this refined 
selection of society anna receptions were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented 
some new and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state 
of the political thermometer of legitimate petersburg court society so dearly and distinctly indicated toward 
the end of 1806 when all the sad details of destruction of the prussian army 
at jena and auerstädt and the surrender of most of the prussian fortresses had been 
received when our troops had already entered prussia and our second war with napoleon was 
beginning anna pávlovna gave one of her soirees the of really good consisted of the 
fascinating hélène forsaken by her husband mortemart the delightful prince hippolyte who had just returned 
from vienna two diplomatists the old aunt a young man referred to in that drawing 
room as man of great un homme de beaucoup de mérite a newly appointed maid 
of honor and her mother and several other less noteworthy persons the novelty anna pávlovna 
was setting before her guests that evening was borís drubetskóy who had just arrived as 
a special messenger from the prussian army and was aide de camp to a very 
important personage the temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that evening was 
this the european sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance bonaparte and to cause me 
and us in general annoyance and mortification our opinion of bonaparte cannot alter we shall 
not cease to express our sincere views on that subject and can only say to 
the king of prussia and others much the worse for you tu voulu george dandin 
all we have to say about it when borís who was to be served up 
to the guests entered the drawing room almost all the company had assembled and the 
conversation guided by anna pávlovna was about our diplomatic relations with austria and the hope 
of an alliance with her borís grown more manly and looking fresh rosy and self 
possessed entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aide de camp 
and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then brought back 
to the general circle anna pávlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced 
him to several persons whom he did not know giving him a whispered description of 
each hippolyte young fellow m kronq from profound intellect and simply man of great of 
the man usually so described thanks to anna efforts his own tastes and the peculiarities 
of his reserved nature borís had managed during his service to place himself very advantageously 
he was aide de camp to a very important personage had been sent on a 
very important mission to prussia and had just returned from there as a special messenger 
he had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so 
pleased at olmütz and according to which an ensign might rank incomparably higher than a 
general and according to which what was needed for success in the service was not 
effort or work or courage or perseverance but only the knowledge of how to get 
on with those who can grant rewards and he was himself often surprised at the 
rapidity of his success and at the inability of others to understand these things in 
consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life all his relations with old friends 
all his plans for his future were completely altered he was not rich but would 
spend his last groat to be better dressed than others and would rather deprive himself 
of many pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear 
in the streets of petersburg in an old uniform he made friends with and sought 
the acquaintance of only those above him in position and who could therefore be of 
use to him he liked petersburg and despised moscow the remembrance of the house and 
of his childish love for natásha was unpleasant to him and he had not once 
been to see the rostóvs since the day of his departure for the army to 
be in anna drawing room he considered an important step up in the service and 
he at once understood his role letting his hostess make use of whatever interest he 
had to offer he himself carefully scanned each face appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy 
with each of those present and the advantages that might accrue he took the seat 
indicated to him beside the fair hélène and listened to the general conversation considers the 
bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that not even a continuity of most brilliant 
successes would secure them and she doubts the means we have of gaining them that 
is the actual phrase used by the vienna cabinet said the danish chargé doubt is 
flattering said man of profound intellect with a subtle smile must distinguish between the vienna 
cabinet and the emperor of austria said mortemart emperor of austria can never have thought 
of such a thing it is only the cabinet that says it my dear vicomte 
put in anna pávlovna for some reason she called it urope as if that were 
a specially refined french pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a frenchman 
ne sera jamais notre alliée sincère will never be our sincere ally after that anna 
pávlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the king of prussia in order 
to draw borís into the conversation borís listened attentively to each of the speakers awaiting 
his turn but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor the beautiful hélène 
whose eyes several times met those of the handsome young aide de camp with a 
smile speaking of the position of prussia anna pávlovna very naturally asked borís to tell 
them about his journey to glogau and in what state he found the prussian army 
borís speaking with deliberation told them in pure correct french many interesting details about the 
armies and the court carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about the 
facts he was recounting for some time he engrossed the general attention and anna pávlovna 
felt that the novelty she had served up was received with pleasure by all her 
visitors the greatest attention of all to narrative was shown by hélène she asked him 
several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the state of the prussian 
army as soon as he had finished she turned to him with her usual smile 
absolutely must come and see me she said in a tone that implied that for 
certain considerations he could not know of this was absolutely necessary tuesday between eight and 
nine it will give me great pleasure borís promised to fulfill her wish and was 
about to begin a conversation with her when anna pávlovna called him away on the 
pretext that her aunt wished to hear him know her husband of course said anna 
pávlovna closing her eyes and indicating hélène with a sorrowful gesture she is such an 
unfortunate and charming woman mention him before it is too painful for her chapter vii 
when borís and anna pávlovna returned to the others prince hippolyte had the ear of 
the company bending forward in his armchair he said roi de prusse and having said 
this laughed everyone turned toward him roi de prusse hippolyte said interrogatively again laughing and 
then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair anna pávlovna waited for him to 
go on but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she began to 
tell of how at potsdam the impious bonaparte had stolen the sword of frederick the 
great is the sword of frederick the great which i she began but hippolyte interrupted 
her with the words roi de prusse and again as soon as all turned toward 
him excused himself and said no more anna pávlovna frowned mortemart friend addressed him firmly 
now what about your roi de prusse hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing nothing 
i only wished to say he wanted to repeat a joke he had heard in 
vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to get in only wished 
to say that we are wrong to fight pour le roi de prusse borís smiled 
circumspectly so that it might be taken as ironical or appreciative according to the way 
the joke was received everybody laughed joke is too bad witty but unjust said anna 
pávlovna shaking her little shriveled finger at him are not fighting pour le roi de 
prusse but for right principles oh that wicked prince hippolyte she said the conversation did 
not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the political news it became particularly animated 
toward the end of the evening when the rewards bestowed by the emperor were mentioned 
know received a snuffbox with the portrait last year said man of profound intellect get 
the same distinction me a snuffbox with the portrait is a reward but not a 
distinction said the gift rather are precedents i may mention schwarzenberg impossible replied another you 
bet the ribbon of the order is a different matter when everybody rose to go 
hélène who had spoken very little all the evening again turned to borís asking him 
in a tone of caressing significant command to come to her on tuesday is of 
great importance to me she said turning with a smile toward anna pávlovna and anna 
pávlovna with the same sad smile with which she spoke of her exalted patroness supported 
wish it seemed as if from some words borís had spoken that evening about the 
prussian army hélène had suddenly found it necessary to see him she seemed to promise 
to explain that necessity to him when he came on tuesday but on tuesday evening 
having come to splendid salon borís received no clear explanation of why it had been 
necessary for him to come there were other guests and the countess talked little to 
him and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in 
a whisper with a strangely unsmiling face to dinner tomorrow in the evening you must 
come come during that stay in petersburg borís became an intimate in the house chapter 
viii the war was flaming up and nearing the russian frontier everywhere one heard curses 
on bonaparte enemy of mankind militiamen and recruits were being enrolled in the villages and 
from the seat of war came contradictory news false as usual and therefore variously interpreted 
the life of old prince bolkónski prince andrew and princess mary had greatly changed since 
1805 in 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief 
then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout russia despite the weakness of age which 
had become particularly noticeable since the time when he thought his son had been killed 
he did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been 
appointed by the emperor himself and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy 
and strength he was continually traveling through the three provinces entrusted to him was pedantic 
in the fulfillment of his duties severe to cruel with his subordinates and went into 
everything down to the minutest details himself princess mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics 
from her father and when the old prince was at home went to his study 
with the wet nurse and little prince nicholas as his grandfather called him the baby 
prince nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse sávishna in the late rooms and 
princess mary spent most of the day in the nursery taking a place to her 
little nephew as best she could mademoiselle bourienne too seemed passionately fond of the boy 
and princess mary often deprived herself to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the 
little she called her playing with him near the altar of the church at bald 
hills there was a chapel over the tomb of the little princess and in this 
chapel was a marble monument brought from italy representing an angel with outspread wings ready 
to fly upwards the upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile and 
once on coming out of the chapel prince andrew and princess mary admitted to one 
another that the face reminded them strangely of the little princess but what was still 
stranger though of this prince andrew said nothing to his sister was that in the 
expression the sculptor had happened to give the face prince andrew read the same mild 
reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife why have you done 
this to me soon after prince return the old prince made over to him a 
large estate boguchárovo about twenty five miles from bald hills partly because of the depressing 
memories associated with bald hills partly because prince andrew did not always feel equal to 
bearing with his peculiarities and partly because he needed solitude prince andrew made use of 
boguchárovo began building and spent most of his time there after the austerlitz campaign prince 
andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service and when the war recommenced 
and everybody had to serve he took a post under his father in the recruitment 
so as to avoid active service the old prince and his son seemed to have 
changed roles since the campaign of 1805 the old man roused by activity expected the 
best results from the new campaign while prince andrew on the contrary taking no part 
in the war and secretly regretting this saw only the dark side on february 26 
1807 the old prince set off on one of his circuits prince andrew remained at 
bald hills as usual during his absence little nicholas had been unwell for four days 
the coachman who had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters 
for prince andrew not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with 
the letters to princess apartments but did not find him there he was told that 
the prince had gone to the nursery you please your excellency pétrusha has brought some 
papers said one of the nursemaids to prince andrew who was sitting on a little 
chair while frowning and with trembling hands he poured drops from a medicine bottle into 
a wineglass half full of water is it he said crossly and his hand shaking 
unintentionally he poured too many drops into the glass he threw the mixture onto the 
floor and asked for some more water the maid brought it there were in the 
room a cot two boxes two armchairs a table a table and the little chair 
on which prince andrew was sitting the curtains were drawn and a single candle was 
burning on the table screened by a bound music book so that the light did 
not fall on the cot dear said princess mary addressing her brother from beside the 
cot where she was standing wait a bit later leave off you always talk nonsense 
and keep putting things this is what comes of it said prince andrew in an 
exasperated whisper evidently meaning to wound his sister dear really better not to wake him 
asleep said the princess in a tone of entreaty prince andrew got up and went 
on tiptoe up to the little bed wineglass in hand really better not wake him 
he said hesitating you please really i think so but as you please said princess 
mary evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had prevailed she drew her attention to 
the maid who was calling him in a whisper it was the second night that 
neither of them had slept watching the boy who was in a high fever these 
last days mistrusting their household doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to 
town they had been trying first one remedy and then another worn out by sleeplessness 
and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and reproached and disputed 
with each other has come with papers from your father whispered the maid prince andrew 
went out take them he muttered and after listening to the verbal instructions his father 
had sent and taking the correspondence and his letter he returned to the nursery he 
asked the same wait for sake karl ivánich always says that sleep is more important 
than anything whispered princess mary with a sigh prince andrew went up to the child 
and felt him he was burning hot you and your karl ivánich he took the 
glass with the drops and again went up to the cot said princess mary but 
he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes and stooped glass 
in hand over the infant i wish it he said beg it him princess mary 
shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively and calling the nurse began giving the 
medicine the child screamed hoarsely prince andrew winced and clutching his head went out and 
sat down on a sofa in the next room he still had all the letters 
in his hand opening them mechanically he began reading the old prince now and then 
using abbreviations wrote in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows have just 
this moment received by special messenger very joyful not false bennigsen seems to have obtained 
a complete victory over buonaparte at eylau in petersburg everyone is rejoicing and the rewards 
sent to the army are innumerable though he is a congratulate him i make out 
what the commander at certain up to till now the additional men and provisions have 
not arrived gallop off to him at once and say have his head off if 
everything is not here in a week have received another letter about the preussisch eylau 
battle from took part in all true when mischief makers meddle even a german beats 
buonaparte he is said to be fleeing in great disorder mind you gallop off to 
kórchevo without delay and carry out instructions prince andrew sighed and broke the seal of 
another envelope it was a closely written letter of two sheets from bilíbin he folded 
it up without reading it and reread his letter ending with the words off to 
kórchevo and carry out instructions pardon me i go now till the child is better 
thought he going to the door and looking into the nursery princess mary was still 
standing by the cot gently rocking the baby yes and what else did he say 
unpleasant thought prince andrew recalling his letter we have gained a victory over bonaparte just 
when not serving yes yes always poking fun at me ah well let him and 
he began reading letter which was written in french he read without understanding half of 
it read only to forget if but for a moment what he had too long 
been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else chapter ix bilíbin was 
now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity and though he wrote in french and 
used french jests and french idioms he described the whole campaign with a fearless self 
censure and self derision genuinely russian bilíbin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic discretion tormented 
him and he was happy to have in prince andrew a reliable correspondent to whom 
he could pour out the bile he had accumulated at the sight of all that 
was being done in the army the letter was old having been written before the 
battle at preussisch eylau the day of our brilliant success at austerlitz wrote bilíbin you 
know my dear prince i never leave headquarters i have certainly acquired a taste for 
war and it is just as well for me what i have seen during these 
last three months is incredible begin ab ovo enemy of the human race as you 
know attacks the prussians the prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us 
three times in three years we take up their cause but it turns out that 
enemy of the human pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude 
and savage way throws himself on the prussians without giving them time to finish the 
parade they had begun and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to 
smithereens and installs himself in the palace at potsdam most ardently desire writes the king 
of prussia to bonaparte your majesty should be received and treated in my palace in 
a manner agreeable to yourself and in so far as circumstances allowed i have hastened 
to take all steps to that end may i have succeeded the prussian generals pride 
themselves on being polite to the french and lay down their arms at the first 
demand head of the garrison at glogau with ten thousand men asks the king of 
prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender all this is 
absolutely true short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude it turns 
out that we have landed ourselves in war and what is more in war on 
our own frontiers with and for the king of prussia we have everything in perfect 
order only one little thing is lacking namely a commander in chief as it was 
considered that the austerlitz success might have been more decisive had the commander in chief 
not been so young all our octogenarians were reviewed and of prozoróvski and kámenski the 
latter was preferred the general comes to us suvórov like in a kibítka and is 
received with acclamations of joy and triumph the 4th the first courier arrives from petersburg 
the mails are taken to the field room for he likes to do everything himself 
i am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us 
the field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him we search but 
none are to be found the field marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself 
and finds letters from the emperor to count t prince v and others then he 
bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything seizes the 
letters opens them and reads those from the emperor addressed to others so the way 
they treat me no confidence in me ah ordered to keep an eye on me 
very well then get along with you so he writes the famous order of the 
day to general bennigsen am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army 
you have brought your army corps to pultúsk routed here it is exposed and without 
fuel or forage so something must be done and as you yourself reported to count 
buxhöwden yesterday you must think of retreating to our do today all my riding he 
writes to the emperor have got a saddle sore which coming after all my previous 
journeys quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army so i have passed 
on the command to the general next in seniority count buxhöwden having sent him my 
whole staff and all that belongs to it advising him if there is a lack 
of bread to move farther into the interior of prussia for only one ration of 
bread remains and in some regiments none at all as reported by the division commanders 
ostermann and sedmorétzki and all that the peasants had has been eaten up i myself 
will remain in hospital at ostrolenka till i recover in regard to which i humbly 
submit my report with the information that if the army remains in its present bivouac 
another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring leave 
to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already in any 
case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for which he 
was chosen i shall await your most gracious permission here in hospital that i may 
not have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army 
my removal from the army does not produce the slightest blind man has left it 
there are thousands such as i in russia field marshal is angry with the emperor 
and he punishes us all it logical is the first act those that follow are 
naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining after the field departure it appears that we are within 
sight of the enemy and must give battle buxhöwden is commander in chief by seniority 
but general bennigsen does not quite see it more particularly as it is he and 
his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by 
the opportunity to fight a battle his own as the germans say he does so 
this is the battle of pultúsk which is considered a great victory but in my 
opinion was nothing of the kind we civilians as you know have a very bad 
way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost those who retreat after a 
battle have lost it is what we say and according to that it is we 
who lost the battle of pultúsk in short we retreat after the battle but send 
a courier to petersburg with news of a victory and general bennigsen hoping to receive 
from petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory does 
not give up the command of the army to general buxhöwden during this interregnum we 
begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers our aim is no longer as 
it should be to avoid or attack the enemy but solely to avoid general buxhöwden 
who by right of seniority should be our chief so energetically do we pursue this 
aim that after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from 
our enemy who at the moment is not bonaparte but buxhöwden general buxhöwden was all 
but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of 
these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him buxhöwden pursues scuttle he hardly crosses the 
river to our side before we recross to the other at last our enemy buxhöwden 
catches us and attacks both generals are angry and the result is a challenge on 
part and an epileptic fit on but at the critical moment the courier who carried 
the news of our victory at pultúsk to petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander 
in chief and our first foe buxhöwden is vanquished we can now turn our thoughts 
to the second bonaparte but as it turns out just at that moment a third 
enemy rises before the orthodox russian soldiers loudly demanding bread meat biscuits fodder and whatnot 
the stores are empty the roads impassable the orthodox begin looting and in a way 
of which our last campaign can give you no idea half the regiments form bands 
and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword the inhabitants are totally 
ruined the hospitals overflow with sick and famine is everywhere twice the marauders even attack 
our headquarters and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse 
them during one of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my dressing 
gown the emperor proposes to give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders 
but i much fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other 
at first prince andrew read with his eyes only but after a while in spite 
of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trust bilíbin what he 
had read began to interest him more and more when he had read thus far 
he crumpled the letter up and threw it away it was not what he had 
read that vexed him but the fact that the life out there in which he 
had now no part could perturb him he shut his eyes rubbed his forehead as 
if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read and listened to 
what was passing in the nursery suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise through 
the door he was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to the child 
while he was reading the letter he went on tiptoe to the nursery door and 
opened it just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something 
from him with a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the 
cot dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him as often 
happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he was seized by an unreasoning occurred to 
him that the child was dead all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm 
this terror is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead 
he went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find it empty and 
that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby he drew the curtain aside and 
for some time his frightened restless eyes could not find the baby at last he 
saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with 
his head lower than the pillow and was smacking his lips in his sleep and 
breathing evenly prince andrew was as glad to find the boy like that as if 
he had already lost him he bent over him and as his sister had taught 
him tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish the soft forehead was 
moist prince andrew touched the head with his hand even the hair was wet so 
profusely had the child perspired he was not dead but evidently the crisis was over 
and he was convalescent prince andrew longed to snatch up to squeeze to hold to 
his heart this helpless little creature but dared not do so he stood over him 
gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the 
blanket he heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of 
the cot he did not look round but still gazing at the face listened to 
his regular breathing the dark shadow was princess mary who had come up to the 
cot with noiseless steps lifted the curtain and dropped it again behind her prince andrew 
recognized her without looking and held out his hand to her she pressed it has 
perspired said prince andrew was coming to tell you so the child moved slightly in 
his sleep smiled and rubbed his forehead against the pillow prince andrew looked at his 
sister in the dim shadow of the curtain her luminous eyes shone more brightly than 
usual from the tears of joy that were in them she leaned over to her 
brother and kissed him slightly catching the curtain of the cot each made the other 
a warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if 
not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the 
world prince andrew was the first to move away ruffling his hair against the muslin 
of the curtain this is the one thing left me now he said with a 
sigh chapter x soon after his admission to the masonic brotherhood pierre went to the 
kiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking with him full directions 
which he had written down for his own guidance as to what he should do 
on his estates when he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the 
head office and explained to them his intentions and wishes he told them that steps 
would be taken immediately to free his that till then they were not to be 
overburdened with labor women while nursing their babies were not to be sent to work 
assistance was to be given to the serfs punishments were to be admonitory and not 
corporal and hospitals asylums and schools were to be established on all the estates some 
of the stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened with alarm supposing these words 
to mean that the young count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of money 
some after their first fright were amused by lisp and the new words they had 
not heard before others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked while the cleverest among 
them including the chief steward understood from this speech how they could best handle the 
master for their own ends the chief steward expressed great sympathy with intentions but remarked 
that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the general state of 
affairs which was far from satisfactory despite count enormous wealth since he had come into 
an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year pierre 
felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an allowance of ten 
thousand rubles he had a dim perception of the following budget about 80 000 went 
in payments on all the estates to the land bank about 30 000 went for 
the upkeep of the estate near moscow the town house and the allowance to the 
three princesses about 15 000 was given in pensions and the same amount for asylums 
150 000 alimony was sent to the countess about 70 000 went for interest on 
debts the building of a new church previously begun had cost about 10 000 in 
each of the last two years and he did not know how the rest about 
100 000 rubles was spent and almost every year he was obliged to borrow besides 
this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests or 
of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops so the first task pierre had to 
face was one for which he had very little aptitude or business he discussed estate 
affairs every day with his chief steward but he felt that this did not forward 
matters at all he felt that these consultations were detached from real affairs and did 
not link up with them or make them move on the one hand the chief 
steward put the state of things to him in the very worst light pointing out 
the necessity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor to 
which pierre did not agree on the other hand pierre demanded that steps should be 
taken to liberate the serfs which the steward met by showing the necessity of first 
paying off the loans from the land bank and the consequent impossibility of a speedy 
emancipation the steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested selling the forests 
in the province of kostromá the land lower down the river and the crimean estate 
in order to make it possible all of which operations according to him were connected 
with such complicated removal of injunctions petitions permits and so pierre became quite bewildered and 
only replied yes do so pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have 
enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only 
tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it the steward for 
his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these consultations very valuable 
for the proprietor and troublesome to himself in kiev pierre found some people he knew 
and strangers hastened to make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer the largest 
landowner of the province temptations to greatest one to which he had confessed when admitted 
to the so strong that he could not resist them again whole days weeks and 
months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied 
with evening parties dinners lunches and balls giving him no time for reflection as in 
petersburg instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the 
old life only in new surroundings of the three precepts of freemasonry pierre realized that 
he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every mason to set an example of 
moral life and that of the seven virtues he lacked and the love of death 
he consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another of the of reforming the 
human had other of his neighbor and especially generosity in the spring of 1807 he 
decided to return to petersburg on the way he intended to visit all his estates 
and see for himself how far his orders had been carried out and in what 
state were the serfs whom god had entrusted to his care and whom he intended 
to benefit the chief steward who considered the young attempts almost to himself to the 
count and to the some concessions continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as 
impracticable he arranged for the erection of large hospitals and all the estates before the 
master arrived everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes which he knew pierre would 
not like but for just such gratefully religious ones with offerings of icons and the 
bread and salt of hospitality as according to his understanding of his master would touch 
and delude him the southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a vienna carriage and 
the solitude of the road all had a gladdening effect on pierre the estates he 
had not before visited were each more picturesque than the other the serfs everywhere seemed 
thriving and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them everywhere were receptions which though 
they embarrassed pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart in one 
place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of saint peter 
and saint paul asking permission as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he 
had conferred on them to build a new chantry to the church at their own 
expense in honor of peter and paul his patron saints in another place the women 
with infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work 
on a third estate the priest bearing a cross came to meet him surrounded by 
children whom by the generosity he was instructing in reading writing and religion on all 
his estates pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of 
erection all on one plan for hospitals schools and almshouses which were soon to be 
opened everywhere he saw the accounts according to which the manorial labor had been diminished 
and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full skirted blue coats 
what pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with bread 
and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter and paul was 
a market village where a fair was held on st day and that the richest 
peasants who formed the deputation had begun the chantry long before but that nine tenths 
of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty he 
did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on 
his land they did still harder work on their own land he did not know 
that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions 
and that the parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured 
their release by heavy payments he did not know that the brick buildings built to 
plan were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased though lessened on 
paper he did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts 
that the payments had been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work had been 
increased by a half and so pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates 
and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left petersburg and wrote enthusiastic 
letters to his as he called the grand master easy it is how little effort 
it needs to do so much good thought pierre how little attention we pay to 
it he was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed at receiving it 
this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple kindly 
people the chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through the 
naïve and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy seeing the effect 
these prearranged receptions had on pierre pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility 
and above all the uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it 
was pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult 
to imagine happier people and that god only knew what would happen to them when 
they were free but he insisted though reluctantly on what he thought right the steward 
promised to do all in his power to carry out the wishes seeing clearly that 
not only would the count never be able to find out whether all measures had 
been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to release them from 
the land bank but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the 
newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to give in money 
and work all that other serfs is to say all that could be got out 
of them chapter xi returning from his journey through south russia in the happiest state 
of mind pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his friend 
bolkónski whom he had not seen for two years boguchárovo lay in a flat uninteresting 
part of the country among fields and forests of fir and birch which were partly 
cut down the house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the 
brink and with banks still bare of grass it was at the end of a 
village that stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which 
were a few fir trees the homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables a 
bathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular façade still in course of 
construction round the house was a garden newly laid out the fences and gates were 
new and solid two fire pumps and a water cart painted green stood in a 
shed the paths were straight the bridges were strong and had handrails everything bore an 
impress of tidiness and good management some domestic serfs pierre met in reply to inquiries 
as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newly built lodge close to 
the pond antón a man who had looked after prince andrew in his boyhood helped 
pierre out of his carriage said that the prince was at home and showed him 
into a clean little anteroom pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though 
clean house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in 
petersburg he quickly entered the small reception room with its still unplastered wooden walls redolent 
of pine and would have gone farther but antón ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked 
at a door what is it came a sharp unpleasant voice visitor answered antón him 
to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back pierre went 
with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face with prince andrew 
who came out frowning and looking old pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed 
his friend on the cheek and looked at him closely i did not expect you 
i am very glad said prince andrew pierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his 
friend with surprise he was struck by the change in him his words were kindly 
and there was a smile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull 
and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not 
give them a joyous and glad sparkle prince andrew had grown thinner paler and more 
manly looking but what amazed and estranged pierre till he got used to it were 
his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought 
as is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation it was long 
before their conversation could settle on anything they put questions and gave brief replies about 
things they knew ought to be talked over at length at last the conversation gradually 
settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plans 
for the future journeys and occupations the war and so on the preoccupation and despondency 
which pierre had noticed in his look was now still more clearly expressed in the 
smile with which he listened to pierre especially when he spoke with joyful animation of 
the past or the future it was as if prince andrew would have liked to 
sympathize with what pierre was saying but could not the latter began to feel that 
it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms dreams and hopes of happiness 
or goodness in prince presence he was ashamed to express his new masonic views which 
had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour he checked himself fearing to 
seem naïve yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as 
possible that he was now a quite different and better pierre than he had been 
in petersburg tell you how much i have lived through since then i hardly know 
myself again we have altered much very much since then said prince andrew and you 
what are your plans repeated prince andrew ironically plans he said as if astonished at 
the word you see building i mean to settle here altogether next year pierre looked 
silently and searchingly into prince face which had grown much older i meant to ask 
pierre began but prince andrew interrupted him why talk of me talk to me yes 
tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates pierre 
began describing what he had done on his estates trying as far as possible to 
conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made prince andrew several times 
prompted story of what he had been doing as though it were all an old 
time story and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of 
what pierre was telling him pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his company and 
at last became silent tell you what my dear fellow said prince andrew who evidently 
also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor am only bivouacking here and have just 
come to look round i am going back to my sister today i will introduce 
you to her but of course you know her already he said evidently trying to 
entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in common will go after dinner 
and would you now like to look round my place they went out and walked 
about till dinnertime talking of the political news and common acquaintances like people who do 
not know each other intimately prince andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of 
the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings but even here while on the 
scaffolding in the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house he 
interrupted himself this is not at all interesting let us have dinner and then set 
off at dinner conversation turned on marriage was very much surprised when i heard of 
it said prince andrew pierre blushed as he always did when it was mentioned and 
said hurriedly will tell you some time how it all happened but you know it 
is all over and forever said prince andrew forever you know how it all ended 
you you heard of the duel so you had to go through that too thing 
i thank god for is that i did not kill that man said pierre so 
asked prince andrew kill a vicious dog is a very good thing really to kill 
a man is is it wrong urged prince andrew is not given to man to 
know what is right and what is wrong men always did and always will err 
and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong does harm to 
another is wrong said pierre feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his 
arrival prince andrew was roused had begun to talk and wanted to express what had 
brought him to his present state who has told you what is bad for another 
man he asked bad exclaimed pierre all know what is bad for ourselves we know 
that but the harm i am conscious of in myself is something i cannot inflict 
on others said prince andrew growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express 
his new outlook to pierre he spoke in french only know two very real evils 
in life remorse and illness the only good is the absence of those evils to 
live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now love of neighbor 
and self sacrifice began pierre i agree with you to live only so as not 
to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough i lived like 
that i lived for myself and ruined my life and only now when i am 
living or at least modesty made him correct himself live for others only now have 
i understood all the happiness of life no i shall not agree with you and 
you do not really believe what you are saying prince andrew looked silently at pierre 
with an ironic smile you see my sister princess mary get on with her he 
said you are right for yourself he added after a short pause everyone lives in 
his own way you lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and 
only found happiness when you began living for others i experienced just the reverse i 
lived for glory after all what is glory the same love of others a desire 
to do something for them a desire for their approval i lived for others and 
not almost but quite ruined my life and i have become calmer since i began 
to live only for myself what do you mean by living only for yourself asked 
pierre growing excited about your son your sister and your father just the same as 
are not others explained prince andrew others neighbors le prochain as you and princess mary 
call it are the chief source of all error and evil le kiev peasants to 
whom you want to do good and he looked at pierre with a mocking challenging 
expression he evidently wished to draw him on are joking replied pierre growing more and 
more excited error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good and 
even doing a i did very little and did it very badly what evil can 
there be in it if unfortunate people our serfs people like ourselves were growing up 
and dying with no idea of god and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and 
are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life retribution recompense and consolation what 
evil and error are there in it if people were dying of disease without help 
while material assistance could so easily be rendered and i supplied them with a doctor 
a hospital and an asylum for the aged and is it not a palpable unquestionable 
good if a peasant or a woman with a baby has no rest day or 
night and i give them rest and leisure said pierre hurrying and lisping i have 
done that though badly and to a small extent but i have done something toward 
it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action and more 
than that you make me believe that you do not think so yourself and the 
main thing is he continued i know and know for certain that the enjoyment of 
doing this good is the only sure happiness in life if you put it like 
that quite a different matter said prince andrew build a house and lay out a 
garden and you build hospitals the one and the other may serve as a pastime 
but right and good must be judged by one who knows all but not by 
us well you want an argument he added on then they rose from the table 
and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda argue then said 
prince andrew talk of schools he went on crooking a finger and so forth that 
is you want to raise pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off 
his cap his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs while it seems to 
me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible and that is just what you 
want to deprive him of i envy him but you want to make him what 
i am without giving him my means then you say his toil but as i 
see it physical labor is as essential to him as much a condition of his 
existence as mental activity is to you or me you help thinking i go to 
bed after two in the morning thoughts come and i sleep but toss about till 
dawn because i think and help thinking just as he help plowing and mowing if 
he he would go to the drink shop or fall ill just as i could 
not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week so 
he could not stand my physical idleness but would grow fat and die the third 
else was it you talked about and prince andrew crooked a third finger yes hospitals 
medicine he has a fit he is dying and you come and bleed him and 
patch him up he will drag about as a cripple a burden to everybody for 
another ten years it would be far easier and simpler for him to die others 
are being born and there are plenty of them as it is it would be 
different if you grudged losing a how i regard you want to cure him from 
love of him and he does not want that and besides what a notion that 
medicine ever cured anyone killed them yes said he frowning angrily and turning away from 
pierre prince andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he 
had reflected on this subject more than once and he spoke readily and rapidly like 
a man who has not talked for a long time his glance became more animated 
as his conclusions became more hopeless that is dreadful dreadful said pierre understand how one 
can live with such ideas i had such moments myself not long ago in moscow 
and when traveling but at such times i collapsed so that i live at seems 
hateful to me myself most of all then i eat wash and how is it 
with you not wash that is not cleanly said prince andrew the contrary one must 
try to make life as pleasant as possible alive that is not my fault so 
i must live out my life as best i can without hurting others with such 
ideas what motive have you for living one would sit without moving undertaking nothing as 
it is leaves one no peace i should be thankful to do nothing but here 
on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to choose me 
to be their marshal it was all i could do to get out of it 
they could not understand that i have not the necessary qualifications for kind of good 
natured fussy shallowness necessary for the position then this house which must be built in 
order to have a nook of own in which to be quiet and now this 
recruiting you serving in the army austerlitz said prince andrew gloomily thank you very much 
i have promised myself not to serve again in the active russian army and i 
even if bonaparte were here at smolénsk threatening bald then i serve in the russian 
army well as i was saying he continued recovering his composure this recruiting my father 
is chief in command of the third district and my only way of avoiding active 
service is to serve under him you are serving am he paused a little while 
why do you serve for this reason my father is one of the most remarkable 
men of his time but he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he 
has too energetic a character he is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is 
terrible and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the recruiting 
granted by the emperor if i had been two hours late a fortnight ago he 
would have had a clerk at yúkhnovna hanged said prince andrew with a smile i 
am serving because i alone have any influence with my father and now and then 
can save him from actions which would torment him afterwards there you see but it 
is not as you imagine prince andrew continued did not and do not in the 
least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some boots from the 
recruits i should even have been very glad to see him hanged but i was 
sorry for my again is for myself prince andrew grew more and more animated his 
eyes glittered feverishly while he tried to prove to pierre that in his actions there 
was no desire to do good to his neighbor now you wish to liberate your 
serfs he continued is a very good thing but not for suppose you ever had 
anyone flogged or sent to still less for your serfs if they are beaten flogged 
or sent to siberia i suppose they are any the worse off in siberia they 
lead the same animal life and the stripes on their bodies heal and they are 
happy as before but it is a good thing for proprietors who perish morally bring 
remorse upon themselves stifle this remorse and grow callous as a result of being able 
to inflict punishments justly and unjustly it is those people i pity and for their 
sake i should like to liberate the serfs you may not have seen but i 
have seen how good men brought up in those traditions of unlimited power in time 
when they grow more irritable become cruel and harsh are conscious of it but cannot 
restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable prince andrew spoke so earnestly that pierre 
could not help thinking that these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his 
case he did not reply what sorry dignity peace of mind purity and not the 
backs and foreheads which beat and shave as you may always remain the same backs 
and foreheads no a thousand times no i shall never agree with you said pierre 
chapter xii in the evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and drove 
to bald hills prince andrew glancing at pierre broke the silence now and then with 
remarks which showed that he was in a good temper pointing to the fields he 
spoke of the improvements he was making in his husbandry pierre remained gloomily silent answering 
in monosyllables and apparently immersed in his own thoughts he was thinking that prince andrew 
was unhappy had gone astray did not see the true light and that he pierre 
ought to aid enlighten and raise him but as soon as he thought of what 
he should say he felt that prince andrew with one word one argument would upset 
all his teaching and he shrank from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what 
to him was precious and sacred but why do you think so pierre suddenly began 
lowering his head and looking like a bull about to charge do you think so 
you should not think so what about asked prince andrew with surprise life about destiny 
it be so i myself thought like that and do you know what saved me 
freemasonry no smile freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as i thought it was 
freemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal aspects of humanity and he 
began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to prince andrew he said that freemasonry 
is the teaching of christianity freed from the bonds of state and church a teaching 
of equality brotherhood and love our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all 
the rest is a dream said pierre my dear fellow that outside this union all 
is filled with deceit and falsehood and i agree with you that nothing is left 
for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life like you merely 
trying not to harm others but make our fundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood 
give yourself up to us let yourself be guided and you will at once feel 
yourself as i have felt myself a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning 
of which is hidden in heaven said pierre prince andrew looking straight in front of 
him listened in silence to words more than once when the noise of the wheels 
prevented his catching what pierre said he asked him to repeat it and by the 
peculiar glow that came into prince eyes and by his silence pierre saw that his 
words were not in vain and that prince andrew would not interrupt him or laugh 
at what he said they reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which 
they had to cross by ferry while the carriage and horses were being placed on 
it they also stepped on the raft prince andrew leaning his arms on the raft 
railing gazed silently at the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun what do you 
think about it pierre asked are you silent do i think about it i am 
listening to you all very well you say join our brotherhood and we will show 
you the aim of life the destiny of man and the laws which govern the 
world but who are we men how is it you know everything why do i 
alone not see what you see you see a reign of goodness and truth on 
earth but i see it pierre interrupted him you believe in a future life he 
asked future life prince andrew repeated but pierre giving him no time to reply took 
the repetition for a denial the more readily as he knew prince former atheistic convictions 
say you see a reign of goodness and truth on earth nor could i and 
it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of 
everything on earth here on this pierre pointed to the fields is no truth all 
is false and evil but in the universe in the whole universe there is a 
kingdom of truth and we who are now the children of earth of the whole 
universe i feel in my soul that i am part of this vast harmonious whole 
i feel that i form one link one step between the lower and higher beings 
in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the supreme power if you prefer 
the manifest if i see clearly see that ladder leading from plant to man why 
should i suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther 
i feel that i cannot vanish since nothing vanishes in this world but that i 
shall always exist and always have existed i feel that beyond me and above me 
there are spirits and that in this world there is truth that is theory said 
prince andrew it is not that which can convince me dear and death are what 
convince what convinces is when one sees a being dear to one bound up with 
own life before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it prince 
voice trembled and he turned away suddenly that being is seized with pain suffers and 
ceases to exist why it cannot be that there is no answer and i believe 
there is what convinces that is what has convinced me said prince andrew yes of 
course said pierre that what saying all i say is that it is not argument 
that convinces me of the necessity of a future life but this when you go 
hand in hand with someone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere 
and you yourself are left facing that abyss and look in and i have looked 
in it then you know that there is a there and there is a someone 
there is the future life the someone prince andrew did not reply the carriage and 
horses had long since been taken off onto the farther bank and reharnessed the sun 
had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near 
the ferry but pierre and andrew to the astonishment of the footmen coachmen and ferrymen 
still stood on the raft and talked there is a god and future life there 
is truth and good and highest happiness consists in striving to attain them we must 
live we must love and we must believe that we live not only today on 
this scrap of earth but have lived and shall live forever there in the whole 
said pierre and he pointed to the sky prince andrew stood leaning on the railing 
of the raft listening to pierre and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the 
red reflection of the sun gleaming on the blue waters there was perfect stillness pierre 
became silent the raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the current 
beat softly against it below prince andrew felt as if the sound of the waves 
kept up a refrain to words whispering is true believe it he sighed and glanced 
with a radiant childlike tender look at face flushed and rapturous but yet shy before 
his superior friend if it only were so said prince andrew it is time to 
get on he added and stepping off the raft he looked up at the sky 
to which pierre had pointed and for the first time since austerlitz saw that high 
everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield and something that had long 
been slumbering something that was best within him suddenly awoke joyful and youthful in his 
soul it vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life 
but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed 
within him his meeting with pierre formed an epoch in prince life though outwardly he 
continued to live in the same old way inwardly he began a new life chapter 
xiii it was getting dusk when prince andrew and pierre drove up to the front 
entrance of the house at bald hills as they approached the house prince andrew with 
a smile drew attention to a commotion going on at the back porch a woman 
bent with age with a wallet on her back and a short long haired young 
man in a black garment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage 
driving up two women ran out after them and all four looking round at the 
carriage ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch are folk said prince 
andrew have mistaken us for my father this is the one matter in which she 
disobeys him he orders these pilgrims to be driven away but she receives them what 
are asked pierre prince andrew had no time to answer the servants came out to 
meet them and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected 
back soon the old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any 
minute prince andrew led pierre to his own apartments which were always kept in perfect 
order and readiness for him in his house he himself went to the nursery us 
go and see my sister he said to pierre when he returned have not found 
her yet she is hiding now sitting with her folk it will serve her right 
she will be confused but you will see her folk really very curious are asked 
pierre and see for yourself princess mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on 
her face when they went in in her snug room with lamps burning before the 
icon stand a young lad with a long nose and long hair wearing a cassock 
sat on the sofa beside her behind a samovar near them in an armchair sat 
a thin shriveled old woman with a meek expression on her childlike face why you 
warn me said the princess with mild reproach as she stood before her pilgrims like 
a hen before her chickens de vous voir je suis très contente de vous voir 
she said to pierre as he kissed her hand she had known him as a 
child and now his friendship with andrew his misfortune with his wife and above all 
his kindly simple face disposed her favorably toward him she looked at him with her 
beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say like you very much but please laugh at 
my people after exchanging the first greetings they sat down to see you i am 
very glad to see you and ivánushka is here too said prince andrew glancing with 
a smile at the young pilgrim said princess mary imploringly faut que vous sachiez que 
une femme said prince andrew to pierre au nom de dieu 2 princess mary repeated 
must know that this is a woman 2 sake it was evident that prince ironical 
tone toward the pilgrims and princess helpless attempts to protect them were their customary long 
established relations on the matter ma bonne amie said prince andrew devriez au contraire reconnaissante 
de ce que à pierre votre intimité avec ce jeune homme my dear you ought 
on the contrary to be grateful to me for explaining to pierre your intimacy with 
this young man said pierre gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and seriousness for which 
princess mary was specially grateful to him into face who seeing that she was being 
spoken about looked round at them all with crafty eyes princess embarrassment on her account 
was quite unnecessary they were not in the least abashed the old woman lowering her 
eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers had turned her cup upside down and 
placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it and sat quietly in her armchair though 
hoping to be offered another cup of tea ivánushka sipping out of her saucer looked 
with sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young men have you been 
to kiev prince andrew asked the old woman have good sir she answered garrulously at 
christmastime i was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the 
shrine of the saint and now from kolyázin master where a great and wonderful blessing 
has been revealed was ivánushka with you go by myself benefactor said ivánushka trying to 
speak in a bass voice only came across pelagéya in yúkhnovo pelagéya interrupted her companion 
she evidently wished to tell what she had seen kolyázin master a wonderful blessing has 
been revealed is it some new relics asked prince andrew do leave off said princess 
mary tell him pelagéya why not my dear why i i like him he is 
kind he is one of chosen a benefactor he once gave me ten rubles i 
remember when i was in kiev crazy cyril says to me one of own and 
goes barefoot summer and winter he says are you not going to the right place 
go to kolyázin where a wonder working icon of the holy mother of god has 
been revealed on hearing those words i said good by to the holy folk and 
went all were silent only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones drawing in 
her breath i come master and the people say to me great blessing has been 
revealed holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed mother the holy virgin mother 
of god right all right you can tell us afterwards said princess mary flushing me 
ask her said pierre you see it yourselves he inquired yes master i was found 
worthy such a brightness on the face like the light of heaven and from the 
blessed cheek it drops and drops dear me that must be a fraud said pierre 
naïvely who had listened attentively to the pilgrim master what are you saying exclaimed the 
horrified pelagéya turning to princess mary for support impose on the people he repeated jesus 
christ exclaimed the pilgrim woman crossing herself speak so master there was a general who 
did not believe and said monks cheat and as soon as said it he went 
blind and he dreamed that the holy virgin mother of the kiev catacombs came to 
him and said in me and i will make you whole so he begged me 
to her take me to her the real truth telling you i saw it myself 
so he was brought quite blind straight to her and he goes up to her 
and falls down and says me whole says he give thee what the tsar bestowed 
on me i saw it myself master the star is fixed into the icon well 
and what do you think he received his sight a sin to speak so god 
will punish you she said admonishingly turning to pierre did the star get into the 
icon pierre asked was the holy mother promoted to the rank of general said prince 
andrew with a smile pelagéya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands master master 
what a sin and you who have a son she began her pallor suddenly turning 
to a vivid red what have you said god forgive you and she crossed herself 
forgive him my dear what does it mean she asked turning to princess mary she 
got up and almost crying began to arrange her wallet she evidently felt frightened and 
ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things could be said and 
was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo the charity of this 
house why need you do it said princess mary did you come to me pelagéya 
i was joking said pierre ma parole je pas voulu i did not mean anything 
i was only joking he said smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense was 
all my fault and andrew was only joking on my word i did not wish 
to offend her pelagéya stopped doubtfully but in face there was such a look of 
sincere penitence and prince andrew glanced so meekly now at her and now at pierre 
that she was gradually reassured chapter xiv the pilgrim woman was appeased and being encouraged 
to talk gave a long account of father amphilochus who led so holy a life 
that his hands smelled of incense and how on her last visit to kiev some 
monks she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs and how she taking 
some dried bread with her had spent two days in the catacombs with the saints 
pray awhile to one ponder awhile then go on to another sleep a bit and 
then again go and kiss the relics and there was such peace all around such 
blessedness that one want to come out even into the light of heaven again pierre 
listened to her attentively and seriously prince andrew went out of the room and then 
leaving to finish their tea princess mary took pierre into the drawing room are very 
kind she said to him i really did not mean to hurt her feelings i 
understand them so well and have the greatest respect for them princess mary looked at 
him silently and smiled affectionately have known you a long time you see and am 
as fond of you as of a brother she said do you find andrew she 
added hurriedly not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words am very anxious 
about him his health was better in the winter but last spring his wound reopened 
and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure and i am 
also very much afraid for him spiritually he has not a character like us women 
who when we suffer can weep away our sorrows he keeps it all within him 
today he is cheerful and in good spirits but that is the effect of your 
is not often like that if you could persuade him to go abroad he needs 
activity and this quiet regular life is very bad for him others notice it but 
i see it toward ten the men servants rushed to the front door hearing the 
bells of the old carriage approaching prince andrew and pierre also went out into the 
porch that asked the old prince noticing pierre as he got out of the carriage 
very glad kiss me he said having learned who the young stranger was the old 
prince was in a good temper and very gracious to pierre before supper prince andrew 
coming back to his study found him disputing hotly with his visitor pierre was maintaining 
that a time would come when there would be no more wars the old prince 
disputed it chaffingly but without getting angry the blood from veins and put in water 
instead then there will be no more war old nonsense he repeated but still he 
patted pierre affectionately on the shoulder and then went up to the table where prince 
andrew evidently not wishing to join in the conversation was looking over the papers his 
father had brought from town the old prince went up to him and began to 
talk business marshal a count rostóv sent half his contingent he came to town and 
wanted to invite me to gave him a pretty dinner and there look at this 
well my boy the old prince went on addressing his son and patting pierre on 
the shoulder fine like him he stirs me up another says clever things and one 
care to listen but this one talks rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up well 
go get along perhaps come and sit with you at supper have another dispute make 
friends with my little fool princess mary he shouted after pierre through the door only 
now on his visit to bald hills did pierre fully realize the strength and charm 
of his friendship with prince andrew that charm was not expressed so much in his 
relations with him as with all his family and with the household with the stern 
old prince and the gentle timid princess mary though he had scarcely known them pierre 
at once felt like an old friend they were all fond of him already not 
only princess mary who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims gave him 
her most radiant looks but even the one year old as his grandfather called him 
smiled at pierre and let himself be taken in his arms and michael ivánovich and 
mademoiselle bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince 
the old prince came in to supper this was evidently on account and during the 
two days of the young visit he was extremely kind to him and told him 
to visit them again when pierre had gone and the members of the household met 
together they began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a 
new acquaintance has left but as seldom happens no one said anything but what was 
good of him chapter xv when returning from his leave rostóv felt for the first 
time how close was the bond that united him to denísov and the whole regiment 
on approaching it rostóv felt as he had done when approaching his home in moscow 
when he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment when he 
recognized red haired deméntyev and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses when lavrúshka 
gleefully shouted to his master count has come and denísov who had been asleep on 
his bed ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him and the 
officers collected round to greet the new arrival rostóv experienced the same feeling as when 
his mother his father and his sister had embraced him and tears of joy choked 
him so that he could not speak the regiment was also a home and as 
unalterably dear and precious as his house when he had reported himself to the commander 
of the regiment and had been reassigned to his former squadron had been on duty 
and had gone out foraging when he had again entered into all the little interests 
of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow unchanging 
frame he experienced the same sense of peace of moral support and the same sense 
of being at home here in his own place as he had felt under the 
parental roof but here was none of all that turmoil of the world at large 
where he did not know his right place and took mistaken decisions here was no 
sónya with whom he ought or ought not to have an explanation here was no 
possibility of going there or not going there here there were not twenty four hours 
in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways there was 
not that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or 
farther from him than another there were none of those uncertain and undefined money relations 
with his father and nothing to recall that terrible loss to dólokhov here in the 
regiment all was clear and simple the whole world was divided into two unequal parts 
one our pávlograd regiment the other all the rest and the rest was no concern 
of his in the regiment everything was definite who was lieutenant who captain who was 
a good fellow who a bad one and most of all who was a comrade 
the canteenkeeper gave one credit pay came every four months there was nothing to think 
out or decide you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the 
pávlograd regiment and when given an order to do what was clearly distinctly and definitely 
all would be well having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental 
life rostóv felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to 
rest life in the regiment during this campaign was all the pleasanter for him because 
after his loss to dólokhov for which in spite of all his efforts to console 
him he could not forgive himself he had made up his mind to atone for 
his fault by serving not as he had done before but really well and by 
being a perfectly first rate comrade and a word a splendid man altogether a thing 
which seemed so difficult out in the world but so possible in the regiment after 
his losses he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents in five 
years he received ten thousand rubles a year but now resolved to take only two 
thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his parents our army after 
repeated retreats and advances and battles at pultúsk and preussisch eylau was concentrated near bartenstein 
it was awaiting the arrival and the beginning of a new campaign the pávlograd regiment 
belonging to that part of the army which had served in the 1805 campaign had 
been recruiting up to strength in russia and arrived too late to take part in 
the first actions of the campaign it had been neither at pultúsk nor at preussisch 
eylau and when it joined the army in the field in the second half of 
the campaign was attached to division division was acting independently of the main army several 
times parts of the pávlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy had taken prisoners 
and once had even captured marshal carriages in april the pávlograds were stationed immovably for 
some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted german village a thaw had set in 
it was muddy and cold the ice on the river broke and the roads became 
impassable for days neither provisions for the men nor fodder for the horses had been 
issued as no transports could arrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages 
searching for potatoes but found few even of these everything had been eaten up and 
the inhabitants had all any remained they were worse than beggars and nothing more could 
be taken from them even the soldiers usually pitiless enough instead of taking anything from 
them often gave them the last of their rations the pávlograd regiment had had only 
two men wounded in action but had lost nearly half its men from hunger and 
sickness in the hospitals death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever or the 
swelling that came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and hardly able to 
drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals when spring came 
on the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground that looked like 
asparagus which for some reason they called sweet root it was very bitter but they 
wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate 
it though they were ordered not to do so as it was a noxious plant 
that spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers a swelling of the arms 
legs and face which the doctors attributed to eating this root but in spite of 
all this the soldiers of squadron fed chiefly on sweet root because it was the 
second week that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate 
of half a pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen 
the horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched roofs 
and had become terribly thin though still covered with tufts of felty winter hair despite 
this destitution the soldiers and officers went on living just as usual despite their pale 
swollen faces and tattered uniforms the hussars formed line for roll call kept things in 
order groomed their horses polished their arms brought in straw from the thatched roofs in 
place of fodder and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose 
up hungry joking about their nasty food and their hunger as usual in their spare 
time they lit bonfires steamed themselves before them naked smoked picked out and baked sprouting 
rotten potatoes told and listened to stories of and campaigns or to legends of alësha 
the sly or the laborer mikólka the officers as usual lived in twos and threes 
in the roofless half ruined houses the seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and 
in general food for the men the younger ones occupied themselves as before some playing 
cards there was plenty of money though there was no food some with more innocent 
games such as quoits and skittles the general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken 
of partly because nothing certain was known about it partly because there was a vague 
feeling that in the main it was going badly rostóv lived as before with denísov 
and since their furlough they had become more friendly than ever denísov never spoke of 
family but by the tender friendship his commander showed him rostóv felt that the elder 
luckless love for natásha played a part in strengthening their friendship denísov evidently tried to 
expose rostóv to danger as seldom as possible and after an action greeted his safe 
return with evident joy on one of his foraging expeditions in a deserted and ruined 
village to which he had come in search of provisions rostóv found a family consisting 
of an old pole and his daughter with an infant in arms they were half 
clad hungry too weak to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining 
a conveyance rostóv brought them to his quarters placed them in his own lodging and 
kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering one of his comrades 
talking of women began chaffing rostóv saying that he was more wily than any of 
them and that it would not be a bad thing if he introduced to them 
the pretty polish girl he had saved rostóv took the joke as an insult flared 
up and said such unpleasant things to the officer that it was all denísov could 
do to prevent a duel when the officer had gone away denísov who did not 
himself know what relations with the polish girl might be began to upbraid him for 
his quickness of temper and rostóv replied what you like she is like a sister 
to me and i tell you how it offended me because well for that reason 
denísov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room without looking at 
rostóv as was his way at moments of deep feeling what a mad bweed you 
wostóvs are he muttered and rostóv noticed tears in his eyes chapter xvi in april 
the troops were enlivened by news of the arrival but rostóv had no chance of 
being present at the review he held at bartenstein as the pávlograds were at the 
outposts far beyond that place they were bivouacking denísov and rostóv were living in an 
earth hut dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf 
the hut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue a 
trench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deep and 
eight feet long at one end of the trench steps were cut out and these 
formed the entrance and vestibule the trench itself was the room in which the lucky 
ones such as the squadron commander had a board lying on piles at the end 
opposite the entrance to serve as a table on each side of the trench the 
earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet and 
this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roof was so constructed that one could 
stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the 
beds if one drew close to the table denísov who was living luxuriously because the 
soldiers of his squadron liked him had also a board in the roof at the 
farther end with a piece of broken but mended glass in it for a window 
when it was very cold embers from the campfire were placed on a bent sheet 
of iron on the steps in the denísov called that part of the it was 
then so warm that the officers of whom there were always some with denísov and 
rostóv sat in their shirt sleeves in april rostóv was on orderly duty one morning 
between seven and eight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changed his 
rain soaked underclothes said his prayers drank tea got warm then tidied up the things 
on the table and in his own corner and his face glowing from exposure to 
the wind and with nothing on but his shirt lay down on his back putting 
his arms under his head he was pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in 
a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting denísov who had gone 
out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk suddenly he heard denísov shouting in 
a vibrating voice behind the hut evidently much excited rostóv moved to the window to 
see whom he was speaking to and saw the quartermaster topchéenko ordered you not to 
let them eat that máshka woot stuff denísov was shouting i saw with my own 
eyes how lazarchúk bwought some fwom the fields have given the order again and again 
your honor but they obey answered the quartermaster rostóv lay down again on his bed 
and thought complacently him fuss and bustle now my done and lying he could hear 
that sly bold orderly of talking as well as the quartermaster lavrúshka was saying something 
about loaded wagons biscuits and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for 
provisions then voice was heard shouting farther and farther away second platoon are they off 
to now thought rostóv five minutes later denísov came into the hut climbed with muddy 
boots on the bed lit his pipe furiously scattered his things about took his leaded 
whip buckled on his saber and went out again in answer to inquiry where he 
was going he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business god and our 
gweat monarch judge me afterwards said denísov going out and rostóv heard the hoofs of 
several horses splashing through the mud he did not even trouble to find out where 
denísov had gone having got warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not 
leave the hut till toward evening denísov had not yet returned the weather had cleared 
up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing sváyka laughing 
as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud rostóv joined them 
in the middle of the game the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars 
on their skinny horses behind them the wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to 
the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them now denísov has been worrying 
said rostóv here are the provisions they are said the officers the soldiers be glad 
a little behind the hussars came denísov accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he 
was talking rostóv went to meet them warn you captain one of the officers a 
short thin man evidently very angry was saying i told you i give them up 
replied denísov will answer for it captain it is the transport of own army our 
men have had nothing to eat for two days mine have had nothing for two 
weeks said denísov is robbery answer for it sir said the infantry officer raising his 
voice what are you pestewing me for cried denísov suddenly losing his temper shall answer 
for it and not you and better not buzz about here till you get hurt 
be off go he shouted at the officers well then shouted the little officer undaunted 
and not riding away you are determined to rob to the devil quick while safe 
and sound and denísov turned his horse on the officer well very well muttered the 
officer threateningly and turning his horse he trotted away jolting in his saddle dog astwide 
a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouted denísov after him the most insulting 
expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman and riding up to rostóv he 
burst out laughing taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said all let our 
men starve the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry 
regiment but learning from lavrúshka that the transport was unescorted denísov with his hussars had 
seized it by force the soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they 
even shared them with the other squadrons the next day the regimental commander sent for 
denísov and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said is how i look 
at this affair i know nothing about it and begin proceedings but i advise you 
to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department 
and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received if not as 
the demand was booked against an infantry regiment there will be a row and the 
affair may end badly from the regimental denísov rode straight to the staff with a 
sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he came back to his 
dugout in a state such as rostóv had never yet seen him in denísov could 
not speak and gasped for breath when rostóv asked what was the matter he only 
uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse feeble voice alarmed at condition rostóv 
suggested that he should undress drink some water and send for the doctor me for 
wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me but always thwash scoundwels and tell 
the ice he muttered the regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessary 
to bleed denísov a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm 
and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him get there 
began denísov then your quarters they were pointed out to wait widden twenty miles and 
have duties to attend to and no time to wait announce me vewy well so 
out comes their head took it into his head to lecture me wobbewy i say 
not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers but by him who 
takes them to fill his own pockets you please be silent good then he says 
and give a weceipt to the commissioner but your affair will be passed on to 
headquarters i go to the commissioner i enter and at the table who do you 
think no but wait a bit who is it starving us shouted denísov hitting the 
table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly 
broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about so you starving us to death 
is it take this and this and i hit him so pat stwaight on his 
snout what a what a and i fwashing him well had a bit of fun 
i can tell you cried denísov gleeful and yet angry his white teeth showing under 
his black mustache have killed him if they taken him away what are you shouting 
for calm yourself said rostóv set your arm bleeding afresh wait we must tie it 
up again denísov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke 
calm and cheerful but at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into and dugout 
with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to major 
denísov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about occurrence the adjutant told 
them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that a court 
martial had been appointed and that in view of the severity with which marauding and 
insubordination were now regarded degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be 
hoped for the case as represented by the offended parties was that after seizing the 
transports major denísov being drunk went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called 
him a thief threatened to strike him and on being led out had rushed into 
the office and given two officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of 
them in answer to renewed questions denísov said laughing that he thought he remembered that 
some other fellow had got mixed up in it but that it was all nonsense 
and rubbish and he did not in the least fear any kind of trial and 
that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they 
would not easily forget denísov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but rostóv knew him 
too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart he feared 
a court martial and was worried over the affair which was evidently taking a bad 
turn every day letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived and on the 
first of may denísov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in 
seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the 
commissariat office on the previous day plátov reconnoitered with two cossack regiments and two squadrons 
of hussars denísov as was his wont rode out in front of the outposts parading 
his courage a bullet fired by a french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part 
of his leg perhaps at another time denísov would not have left the regiment for 
so slight a wound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from 
appearing at the staff and went into hospital chapter xvii in june the battle of 
friedland was fought in which the pávlograds did not take part and after that an 
armistice was proclaimed rostóv who felt his absence very much having no news of him 
since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his 
affairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit denísov in hospital the 
hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastated by russian and 
french troops because it was summer when it is so beautiful out in the fields 
the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its 
foul streets tattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about the hospital was 
in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a 
courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces 
several bandaged soldiers with pale swollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine 
in the yard directly rostóv entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of 
putrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian army doctor smoking a 
cigar the doctor was followed by a russian assistant tear myself to pieces the doctor 
was saying to makár alexéevich in the evening i shall be there the assistant asked 
some further questions do the best you can it all the same the doctor noticed 
rostóv coming upstairs do you want sir said the doctor do you want the bullets 
having spared you do you want to try typhus this is a pesthouse sir so 
asked rostóv sir death to go in only we two makéev and he pointed to 
the assistant on here some five of us doctors have died in this place when 
a new one comes he is done for in a week said the doctor with 
evident satisfaction doctors have been invited here but our allies like it at all rostóv 
explained that he wanted to see major denísov of the hussars who was wounded know 
i tell you sir only think i am alone in charge of three hospitals with 
more than four hundred patients well that the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds 
of coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost he laughed hundred 
sir and always sending me fresh ones there are four hundred eh he asked turning 
to the assistant the assistant looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and impatient for 
the talkative doctor to go denísov rostóv said again was wounded at molliten i fancy 
eh makéev queried the doctor in a tone of indifference the assistant however did not 
confirm the words he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctor rostóv described appearance 
was one like that said the doctor as if pleased one is dead i fancy 
however look up our list we had a list have you got it makéev alexéevich 
has the list answered the assistant if step into the wards see for yourself he 
added turning to rostóv better not go sir said the doctor you may have to 
stay here yourself but rostóv bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant 
to show him the way blame me the doctor shouted up after him rostóv and 
the assistant went into the dark corridor the smell was so strong there that rostóv 
held his nose and had to pause and collect his strength before he could go 
on a door opened to the right and an emaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot 
and in underclothing limped out and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering envious eyes 
at those who were passing glancing in at the door rostóv saw that the sick 
and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats i go in and 
look is there to see said the assistant but just because the assistant evidently did 
not want him to go in rostóv entered the ward the foul air to which 
he had already begun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here it 
was a little different more pungent and one felt that this was where it originated 
in the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows the 
sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls and leaving 
a passage in the middle most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to 
the newcomers those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and 
all looked intently at rostóv with the same expression of hope of relief reproach and 
envy of health rostóv went to the middle of the room and looking through the 
open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there he stood still 
looking silently around he had not at all expected such a sight just before him 
almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor lay a sick man 
probably a cossack to judge by the cut of his hair the man lay on 
his back his huge arms and legs outstretched his face was purple his eyes were 
rolled back so that only the whites were seen and on his bare legs and 
arms which were still red the veins stood out like cords he was knocking the 
back of his head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating 
rostóv listened and made out the word it was drink a drink rostóv glanced round 
looking for someone who would put this man back in his place and bring him 
water looks after the sick here he asked the assistant just then a commissariat soldier 
a hospital orderly came in from the next room marching stiffly and drew up in 
front of rostóv day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at rostóv and evidently 
mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities him to his place and give him 
some water said rostóv pointing to the cossack your honor the soldier replied complacently and 
rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did not 
move impossible to do anything here thought rostóv lowering his eyes and he was going 
out but became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his right and 
he turned close to the corner on an overcoat sat an old unshaven gray bearded 
soldier as thin as a skeleton with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed 
on rostóv the neighbor on one side whispered something to him pointing at rostóv who 
noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him he drew nearer and saw 
that the old man had only one leg bent under him the other had been 
amputated above the knee his neighbor on the other side who lay motionless some distance 
from him with his head thrown back was a young soldier with a snub nose 
his pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back rostóv looked 
at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back this one seems 
he began turning to the assistant how been begging your honor said the old soldier 
his jaw quivering been dead since morning after all men not dogs send someone at 
once he shall be taken away at once said the assistant hurriedly us go your 
honor yes let us go said rostóv hastily and lowering his eyes and shrinking he 
tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon 
him and went out of the room chapter xviii going along the corridor the assistant 
led rostóv to the wards consisting of three rooms the doors of which stood open 
there were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or 
sitting on them some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns the first 
person rostóv met in the ward was a thin little man with one arm who 
was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown with a 
pipe between his teeth rostóv looked at him trying to remember where he had seen 
him before where met again said the little man túshin you remember who gave you 
a lift at schön grabern and had a bit cut off you see he went 
on with a smile pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown for vasíli 
dmítrich denísov my neighbor he added when he heard who rostóv wanted here and túshin 
led him into the next room from whence came sounds of several laughing voices can 
they laugh or even live at all here thought rostóv still aware of that smell 
of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the ward and still seeming to 
see fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him out from both sides 
and the face of that young soldier with eyes rolled back denísov lay asleep on 
his bed with his head under the blanket though it was nearly noon wostóv how 
are you how are you he called out still in the same voice as in 
the regiment but rostóv noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some new 
sinister hidden feeling showed itself in the expression of face and the intonations of his 
voice his wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeks 
after he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as the faces 
of the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck rostóv what struck 
him was that denísov did not seem glad to see him and smiled at him 
unnaturally he did not ask about the regiment nor about the general state of affairs 
and when rostóv spoke of these matters did not listen rostóv even noticed that denísov 
did not like to be reminded of the regiment or in general of that other 
free life which was going on outside the hospital he seemed to try to forget 
that old life and was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers on 
inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced from under his pillow 
a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of his answer 
to it he became animated when he began reading his paper and specially drew attention 
to the stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies his hospital companions who had gathered 
round fresh arrival from the world began to disperse as soon as denísov began reading 
his answer rostóv noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that 
story more than once and were tired of it only the man who had the 
next bed a stout uhlan continued to sit on his bed gloomily frowning and smoking 
a pipe and little one armed túshin still listened shaking his head disapprovingly in the 
middle of the reading the uhlan interrupted denísov what i say is he said turning 
to rostóv would be best simply to petition the emperor for pardon they say great 
rewards will now be distributed and surely a pardon would be granted petition the exclaimed 
denísov in a voice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and 
fire but which sounded like an expression of irritable impotence for if i were a 
wobber i would ask mercy but being court martialed for bwinging wobbers to book let 
them twy me not afwaid of anyone served the tsar and my countwy honowably and 
have not stolen and am i to be degwaded listen to them stwaight this is 
what i say i had wobbed the tweasuwy certainly well written said túshin not the 
point vasíli dmítrich and he also turned to rostóv has to submit and vasíli dmítrich 
want to you know the auditor told you it was a bad business let it 
be bad said denísov auditor wrote out a petition for you continued túshin you ought 
to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubt indicating rostóv connections 
on the staff you find a better opportunity i said not going to gwovel denísov 
interrupted him went on reading his paper rostóv had not the courage to persuade denísov 
though he instinctively felt that the way advised by túshin and the other officers was 
the safest and though he would have been glad to be of service to denísov 
he knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper when the reading of virulent reply 
which took more than an hour was over rostóv said nothing and he spent the 
rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid hospital comrades who 
had gathered round him telling them what he knew and listening to their stories denísov 
was moodily silent all the evening late in the evening when rostóv was about to 
leave he asked denísov whether he had no commission for him wait a bit said 
denísov glancing round at the officers and taking his papers from under his pillow he 
went to the window where he had an inkpot and sat down to write seems 
no use knocking head against a wall he said coming from the window and giving 
rostóv a large envelope in it was the petition to the emperor drawn up by 
the auditor in which denísov without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simply 
asked for pardon it in it seems he did not finish but gave a painfully 
unnatural smile chapter xix having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state 
of affairs rostóv rode to tilsit with the letter to the emperor on the thirteenth 
of june the french and russian emperors arrived in tilsit borís drubetskóy had asked the 
important personage on whom he was in attendance to include him in the suite appointed 
for the stay at tilsit should like to see the great man he said alluding 
to napoleon whom hitherto he like everyone else had always called buonaparte are speaking of 
buonaparte asked the general smiling borís looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that 
he was being tested am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied the general 
patted him on the shoulder with a smile will go far he said and took 
him to tilsit with him borís was among the few present at the niemen on 
the day the two emperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleon 
pass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river saw the pensive 
face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the 
bank of the niemen awaiting arrival saw both emperors get into boats and saw how 
the raft quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand to him and 
how they both retired into the pavilion since he had begun to move in the 
highest circles borís had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on 
around him and to note it down at the time of the meeting at tilsit 
he asked the names of those who had come with napoleon and about the uniforms 
they wore and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages at the moment the 
emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to 
look at it again when alexander came out the interview had lasted an hour and 
fifty three minutes he noted this down that same evening among other facts he felt 
to be of historic importance as the suite was a very small one it was 
a matter of great importance for a man who valued his success in the service 
to be at tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two emperors and 
having succeeded in this borís felt that henceforth his position was fully assured he had 
not only become known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him twice 
he had executed commissions to the emperor himself so that the latter knew his face 
and all those at court far from cold shouldering him as at first when they 
considered him a newcomer would now have been surprised had he been absent borís lodged 
with another adjutant the polish count zhilínski zhilínski a pole brought up in paris was 
rich and passionately fond of the french and almost every day of the stay at 
tilsit french officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and lunching with 
him and borís on the evening of the twenty fourth of june count zhilínski arranged 
a supper for his french friends the guest of honor was an aide de camp 
of there were also several french officers of the guard and a page of a 
young lad of an old aristocratic french family that same day rostóv profiting by the 
darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress came to tilsit and went to the 
lodging occupied by borís and zhilínski rostóv in common with the whole army from which 
he came was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the 
from being foes had suddenly become had taken place at headquarters and in borís in 
the army bonaparte and the french were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt 
and fear only recently talking with one of cossack officers rostóv had argued that if 
napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign but as a 
criminal quite lately happening to meet a wounded french colonel on the road rostóv had 
maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal bonaparte 
rostóv was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of french officers in lodging dressed in 
uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from 
the outposts of the flank as soon as he noticed a french officer who thrust 
his head out of the door that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced 
at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him he stopped at the threshold and 
asked in russian whether drubetskóy lived there borís hearing a strange voice in the anteroom 
came out to meet him an expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on 
his face on first recognizing rostóv you very glad very glad to see you he 
said however coming toward him with a smile but rostóv had noticed his first impulse 
come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i have 
business he said coldly i only wonder how you managed to get away from your 
regiment dans un moment je suis à vous he said answering someone who called him 
a minute i shall be at your disposal see intruding rostóv repeated the look of 
annoyance had already disappeared from face having evidently reflected and decided how to act he 
very quietly took both hands and led him into the next room his eyes looking 
serenely and steadily at rostóv seemed to be veiled by something as if screened by 
blue spectacles of conventionality so it seemed to rostóv come now as if you could 
come at a wrong time said borís and he led him into the room where 
the supper table was laid and introduced him to his guests explaining that he was 
not a civilian but an hussar officer and an old friend of his comte n 
n capitaine s s said he naming his guests rostóv looked frowningly at the frenchmen 
bowed reluctantly and remained silent zhilínski evidently did not receive this new russian person very 
willingly into his circle and did not speak to rostóv borís did not appear to 
notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the same pleasant composure and the same 
veiled look in his eyes with which he had met rostóv tried to enliven the 
conversation one of the frenchmen with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen addressed the obstinately 
taciturn rostóv saying that the latter had probably come to tilsit to see the emperor 
i came on business replied rostóv briefly rostóv had been out of humor from the 
moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on face and as always happens to those 
in a bad humor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and 
that he was in way he really was in their way for he alone took 
no part in the conversation which again became general the looks the visitors cast on 
him seemed to say what is he sitting here for he rose and went up 
to borís in your way he said in a low tone and talk over my 
business and go away no not at all said borís if you are tired come 
and lie down in my room and have a rest really they went into the 
little room where borís slept rostóv without sitting down began at once irritably as if 
borís were to blame in some way telling him about affair asking him whether through 
his general he could and would intercede with the emperor on behalf and get petition 
handed in when he and borís were alone rostóv felt for the first time that 
he could not look borís in the face without a sense of awkwardness borís with 
one leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers 
of his right listened to rostóv as a general listens to the report of a 
subordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight into eyes with the same veiled look 
each time this happened rostóv felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes have heard of 
such cases and know that his majesty is very severe in such affairs i think 
it would be best not to bring it before the emperor but to apply to 
the commander of the corps but in general i think you want to do anything 
well then say so rostóv almost shouted not looking borís in the face borís smiled 
the contrary i will do what i can only i thought at that moment voice 
was heard calling borís then go go go said rostóv and refusing supper and remaining 
alone in the little room he walked up and down for a long time hearing 
the lighthearted french conversation from the next room chapter xx rostóv had come to tilsit 
the day least suitable for a petition on behalf he could not himself go to 
the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without 
permission to do so and borís even had he wished to could not have done 
so on the following day on that day june 27 the preliminaries of peace were 
signed the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the cross of the legion of honor and 
napoleon the order of st andrew of the first degree and a dinner had been 
arranged for the evening given by a battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhénsk 
battalion the emperors were to be present at that banquet rostóv felt so ill at 
ease and uncomfortable with borís that when the latter looked in after supper he pretended 
to be asleep and early next morning went away avoiding borís in his civilian clothes 
and a round hat he wandered about the town staring at the french and their 
uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french emperors were staying 
in a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner 
he saw the russian and french colors draped from side to side of the streets 
with huge monograms a and n in the windows of the houses also flags and 
bunting were displayed want to help me and i want to ask him settled thought 
nicholas is over between us but i leave here without having done all i can 
for denísov and certainly not without getting his letter to the emperor the emperor he 
is here thought rostóv who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexander lodged saddled 
horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling evidently preparing for the 
emperor to come out may see him at any moment thought rostóv only i were 
to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest 
me for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand on whose side justice lies 
he understands everything knows everything who can be more just more magnanimous than he and 
even if they did arrest me for being here what would it matter thought he 
looking at an officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied all people do 
go in all nonsense go in and hand the letter to the emperor myself so 
much the worse for drubetskóy who drives me to it and suddenly with a determination 
he himself did not expect rostóv felt for the letter in his pocket and went 
straight to the house i miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitz he 
thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious of the blood that rushed 
to his heart at the thought will fall at his feet and beseech him he 
will lift me up will listen and will even thank me am happy when i 
can do good but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness rostóv fancied the sovereign 
saying and passing people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of 
the house a broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right 
he saw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to the 
lower floor do you want someone inquired hand in a letter a petition to his 
majesty said nicholas with a tremor in his voice petition this way to the officer 
on he was shown the door leading downstairs it be accepted on hearing this indifferent 
voice rostóv grew frightened at what he was doing the thought of meeting the emperor 
at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to 
run away but the official who had questioned him opened the door and rostóv entered 
a short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots and a 
batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in that room and 
his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of 
handsome silk embroidered braces that for some reason attracted attention this man was speaking to 
someone in the adjoining room good figure and in her first bloom he was saying 
but on seeing rostóv he stopped short and frowned is it a petition is it 
asked the person in the other room petitioner answered the man with the braces him 
to come later be coming out directly we must go later tomorrow too late rostóv 
turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stopped him have 
you come from who are you come from major denísov answered rostóv you an officer 
count rostóv audacity hand it in through your commander and go along with you go 
and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him rostóv went back 
into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were many officers and generals 
in full parade uniform whom he had to pass cursing his temerity his heart sinking 
at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the emperor 
and being put to shame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the 
impropriety of his conduct and repenting of it rostóv with downcast eyes was making his 
way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him 
and a hand detained him are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a 
deep voice it was a cavalry general who had obtained the special favor during this 
campaign and who had formerly commanded the division in which rostóv was serving rostóv in 
dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindly jocular face of the general he took 
him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair asking him to 
intercede for denísov whom the general knew having heard rostóv to the end the general 
shook his head gravely sorry sorry for that fine fellow give me the letter hardly 
had rostóv handed him the letter and finished explaining case when hasty steps and the 
jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs and the general leaving him went to 
the porch the gentlemen of the suite ran down the stairs and went to their 
horses hayne the same groom who had been at austerlitz led up the horse and 
the faint creak of a footstep rostóv knew at once was heard on the stairs 
forgetting the danger of being recognized rostóv went close to the porch together with some 
inquisitive civilians and again after two years saw those features he adored that same face 
and same look and step and the same union of majesty and mildness and the 
feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in soul in all its 
old force in the uniform of the preobrazhénsk chamois leather breeches and high wearing a 
star rostóv did not know it was that of the légion the monarch came out 
into the porch putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm he 
stopped and looked about him brightening everything around by his glance he spoke a few 
words to some of the generals and recognizing the former commander of division smiled and 
beckoned to him all the suite drew back and rostóv saw the general talking for 
some time to the emperor the emperor said a few words to him and took 
a step toward his horse again the crowd of members of the suite and street 
gazers among whom was rostóv moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside his horse with 
his hand on the saddle the emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in 
a loud voice evidently wishing to be heard by all cannot do it general i 
cannot because the law is stronger than i and he raised his foot to the 
stirrup the general bowed his head respectfully and the monarch mounted and rode down the 
street at a gallop beside himself with enthusiasm rostóv ran after him with the crowd 
chapter xxi the emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion of 
the preobrazhénsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the french guards in 
their bearskin caps on the left as the tsar rode up to one flank of 
the battalions which presented arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank 
and at the head of them rostóv recognized napoleon it could be no one else 
he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over a 
white vest and the st andrew ribbon over his shoulder he was riding a very 
fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson gold embroidered saddlecloth on approaching alexander he 
raised his hat and as he did so rostóv with his eye could not help 
noticing that napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle the battalions shouted 
and napoleon said something to alexander and both emperors dismounted and took each hands face 
wore an unpleasant and artificial smile alexander was saying something affable to him in spite 
of the trampling of the french horses which were pushing back the crowd rostóv kept 
his eyes on every movement of alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise 
that alexander treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease 
with the tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter to 
him alexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites approached the right flank 
of the preobrazhénsk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there the crowd 
unexpectedly found itself so close to the emperors that rostóv standing in the front row 
was afraid he might be recognized i ask your permission to present the legion of 
honor to the bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulating every letter 
this was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into eyes alexander listened attentively 
to what was said to him and bending his head smiled pleasantly him who has 
borne himself most bravely in this last war added napoleon accentuating each syllable as with 
a composure and assurance exasperating to rostóv he ran his eyes over the russian ranks 
drawn up before him who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their emperor 
your majesty allow me to consult the colonel said alexander and took a few hasty 
steps toward prince kozlóvski the commander of the battalion bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove 
off his small white hand tore it in doing so and threw it away an 
aide de camp behind him rushed forward and picked it up whom shall it be 
given the emperor alexander asked kozlóvski in russian in a low voice whomever your majesty 
commands the emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and glancing back remarked we must give 
him an answer kozlóvski scanned the ranks resolutely and included rostóv in his scrutiny it 
be me thought rostóv the colonel called with a frown and lázarev the first soldier 
in the rank stepped briskly forward are you off to stop here voices whispered to 
lázarev who did not know where to go lázarev stopped casting a sidelong look at 
his colonel in alarm his face twitched as often happens to soldiers called before the 
ranks napoleon slightly turned his head and put his plump little hand out behind him 
as if to take something the members of his suite guessing at once what he 
wanted moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another and a 
same one rostóv had seen the previous evening at forward and bowing respectfully over the 
outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment laid in it an order on 
a red ribbon napoleon without looking pressed two fingers together and the badge was between 
them then he approached lázarev who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own 
monarch looked round at the emperor alexander to imply that what he was now doing 
was done for the sake of his ally and the small white hand holding the 
order touched one of buttons it was as if napoleon knew that it was only 
necessary for his hand to deign to touch that breast for the soldier to be 
forever happy rewarded and distinguished from everyone else in the world napoleon merely laid the 
cross on breast and dropping his hand turned toward alexander as though sure that the 
cross would adhere there and it really did officious hands russian and french immediately seized 
the cross and fastened it to the uniform lázarev glanced morosely at the little man 
with white hands who was doing something to him and still standing motionless presenting arms 
looked again straight into eyes as if asking whether he should stand there or go 
away or do something else but receiving no orders he remained for some time in 
that rigid position the emperors remounted and rode away the preobrazhénsk battalion breaking rank mingled 
with the french guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them lázarev sat 
in the place of honor russian and french officers embraced him congratulated him and pressed 
his hands crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him a rumble 
of russian and french voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the 
square two officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed by rostóv think of 
the treat all on silver plate one of them was saying you seen lázarev have 
i hear the preobrazhénskis will give them a dinner but what luck for lázarev twelve 
hundred pension for life a cap lads shouted a preobrazhénsk soldier donning a shaggy french 
cap a fine thing first rate you heard the password asked one officer of another 
day before yesterday it was france yesterday russie grandeur one day our emperor gives it 
and next day napoleon tomorrow our emperor will send a st cross to the bravest 
of the french guards it has to be done he must respond in kind borís 
too with his friend zhilínski came to see the preobrazhénsk banquet on his way back 
he noticed rostóv standing by the corner of a house how do we missed one 
another he said and could not refrain from asking what was the matter so strangely 
dismal and troubled was face nothing replied rostóv call round i will rostóv stood at 
that corner for a long time watching the feast from a distance in his mind 
a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion terrible 
doubts rose in his soul now he remembered denísov with his changed expression his submission 
and the whole hospital with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease 
so vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round 
to see where the smell came from next he thought of that self satisfied bonaparte 
with his small white hand who was now an emperor liked and respected by alexander 
then why those severed arms and legs and those dead men then again he thought 
of lázarev rewarded and denísov punished and unpardoned he caught himself harboring such strange thoughts 
that he was frightened the smell of the food the preobrazhénskis were eating and a 
sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something to eat 
before going away he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning there he 
found so many people among them officers who like himself had come in civilian clothes 
that he had difficulty in getting a dinner two officers of his own division joined 
him the conversation naturally turned on the peace the officers his comrades like most of 
the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of friedland they said 
that had we held out a little longer napoleon would have been done for as 
his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition nicholas ate and drank chiefly the latter in 
silence he finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself the process in his 
mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion he feared to give way to 
his thoughts yet could not get rid of them suddenly on one of the saying 
that it was humiliating to look at the french rostóv began shouting with uncalled for 
wrath and therefore much to the surprise of the officers can you judge best he 
cried the blood suddenly rushing to his face can you judge the actions what right 
have we to argue we cannot comprehend either the aims or his actions i never 
said a word about the emperor said the officer justifying himself and unable to understand 
outburst except on the supposition that he was drunk but rostóv did not listen to 
him are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more he went on we 
are ordered to die we must die if punished it means that we have deserved 
it not for us to judge if the emperor pleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor 
and to conclude an alliance with him it means that that is the right thing 
to do if once we begin judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred will be 
left that way we shall be saying there is no shouted nicholas banging the little 
to the point as it seemed to his listeners but quite relevantly to the course 
of his own thoughts business is to do our duty to fight and not to 
think all said he to drink said one of the officers not wishing to quarrel 
and to drink assented nicholas there another bottle he shouted in 1808 the emperor alexander 
went to erfurt for a fresh interview with the emperor napoleon and in the upper 
circles of petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting chapter 
xxii in 1809 the intimacy between two arbiters as napoleon and alexander were called was 
such that when napoleon declared war on austria a russian corps crossed the frontier to 
co operate with our old enemy bonaparte against our old ally the emperor of austria 
and in court circles the possibility of marriage between napoleon and one of sisters was 
spoken of but besides considerations of foreign policy the attention of russian society was at 
that time keenly directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the 
departments of government life life with its essential interests of health and sickness toil and 
rest and its intellectual interests in thought science poetry music love friendship hatred and on 
as usual independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity with napoleon bonaparte and 
from all the schemes of reconstruction book six 1808 10 chapter i prince andrew had 
spent two years continuously in the country all the plans pierre had attempted on his 
constantly changing from one thing to another had never carried out by prince andrew without 
display and without perceptible difficulty he had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which 
pierre lacked and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going on 
one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became free agricultural being 
one of the first examples of the kind in russia on other estates the compulsory 
labor was commuted for a quitrent a trained midwife was engaged for boguchárovo at his 
expense and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to the children of 
the peasants and household serfs prince andrew spent half his time at bald hills with 
his father and his son who was still in the care of nurses the other 
half he spent in cloister as his father called prince estate despite the indifference to 
the affairs of the world he had expressed to pierre he diligently followed all that 
went on received many books and to his surprise noticed that when he or his 
father had visitors from petersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind never 
left the knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs besides being occupied 
with his estates and reading a great variety of books prince andrew was at this 
time busy with a critical survey of our last two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing 
up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations in the spring 
of 1809 he went to visit the ryazán estates which had been inherited by his 
son whose guardian he was warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the calèche 
looking at the new grass the first leaves on the birches and the first puffs 
of white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky he was not thinking of 
anything but looked absent mindedly and cheerfully from side to side they crossed the ferry 
where he had talked with pierre the year before they went through the muddy village 
past threshing floors and green fields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near 
the bridge uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past strips of 
stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there and into a birch forest 
growing on both sides of the road in the forest it was almost hot no 
wind could be felt the birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless and lilac 
colored flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last 
leaves the coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among 
the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter on entering the forest the horses began 
to snort and sweated visibly peter the footman made some remark to the coachman the 
latter assented but apparently the sympathy was not enough for peter and he turned on 
the box toward his master pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful 
smile pleasant your excellency is he talking about thought prince andrew the spring i suppose 
he thought as he turned round really everything is green already how early the birches 
and cherry and alders too are coming out but the oaks show no sign yet 
ah here is one oak at the edge of the road stood an oak probably 
ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest it was ten times 
as thick and twice as tall as they it was an enormous tree its girth 
twice as great as a man could embrace and evidently long ago some of its 
branches had been broken off and its bark scarred with its huge ungainly limbs sprawling 
unsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an aged stern and scornful monster 
among the smiling birch trees only the dead looking evergreen firs dotted about in the 
forest and this oak refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either 
the spring or the sunshine love happiness this oak seemed to say you not weary 
of that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always the same and always a fraud there 
is no spring no sun no happiness look at those cramped dead firs ever the 
same and at me too sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they 
have grown whether from my back or my sides as they have grown so i 
stand and i do not believe in your hopes and your lies as he passed 
through the forest prince andrew turned several times to look at that oak as if 
expecting something from it under the oak too were flowers and grass but it stood 
among them scowling rigid misshapen and grim as ever the oak is right a thousand 
times right thought prince andrew afresh to that fraud but we know life our life 
is finished a whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rose in his 
soul in connection with that tree during this journey he as it were considered his 
life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion restful in its hopelessness that it was 
not for him to begin anything that he must live out his life content to 
do no harm and not disturbing himself or desiring anything chapter ii prince andrew had 
to see the marshal of the nobility for the district in connection with the affairs 
of the ryazán estate of which he was trustee this marshal was count ilyá rostóv 
and in the middle of may prince andrew went to visit him it was now 
hot spring weather the whole forest was already clothed in green it was dusty and 
so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe prince andrew depressed and 
preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the marshal was driving 
up the avenue in the grounds of the house at otrádnoe he heard merry girlish 
cries behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to 
cross the path of his calèche ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran 
a dark haired remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with a white 
handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped the girl was 
shouting something but seeing that he was a stranger ran back laughing without looking at 
him suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so 
beautiful the sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girl did 
not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented and cheerful in 
her own bright and happy life is she so glad about what is she thinking 
of not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of the ryazán quitrents of 
what is she thinking why is she so happy prince andrew asked himself with instinctive 
curiosity in 1809 count ilyá rostóv was living at otrádnoe just as he had done 
in former years that is entertaining almost the whole province with hunts theatricals dinners and 
music he was glad to see prince andrew as he was to see any new 
visitor and insisted on his staying the night during the dull day in the course 
of which he was entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important of 
the visitors the old house was crowded on account of an approaching name day prince 
andrew repeatedly glanced at natásha gay and laughing among the younger members of the company 
and asked himself each time is she thinking about why is she so glad that 
night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep he read awhile and 
then put out his candle but relit it it was hot in the room the 
inside shutters of which were closed he was cross with the stupid old man as 
he called rostóv who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents 
had not yet arrived from town and he was vexed with himself for having stayed 
he got up and went to the window to open it as soon as he 
opened the shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burst 
into the room he opened the casement the night was fresh bright and very still 
just before the window was a row of pollard trees looking black on one side 
and with a silvery light on the other beneath the trees grew some kind of 
lush wet bushy vegetation with silver lit leaves and stems here and there farther back 
beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy 
tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at 
its full in a pale almost starless spring sky prince andrew leaned his elbows on 
the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky his room was on the 
first floor those in the rooms above were also awake he heard female voices overhead 
once more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew recognized at once when 
are you coming to bed replied another voice i sleep the use come now for 
the last time two girlish voices sang a musical end of some song how lovely 
now go to sleep and an end of it go to sleep but i said 
the first voice coming nearer to the window she was evidently leaning right out for 
the rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard everything was stone 
still like the moon and its light and the shadows prince andrew too dared not 
stir for fear of betraying his unintentional presence sónya he again heard the first speaker 
how can you sleep only look how glorious it is ah how glorious do wake 
up sónya she said almost with tears in her voice never never was such a 
lovely night before sónya made some reluctant reply just come and see what a moon 
oh how lovely come here darling sweetheart come here there you see i feel like 
sitting down on my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tight 
as tight as possible and flying away like this care fall out he heard the 
sound of a scuffle and disapproving voice past one you only spoil things for me 
all right go go again all was silent but prince andrew knew she was still 
sitting there from time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a 
sigh god o god what does it mean she suddenly exclaimed bed then if it 
must be and she slammed the casement her i might as well not exist thought 
prince andrew while he listened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that 
she might say something about him she is again as if it were on purpose 
thought he in his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts 
and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unable to explain his 
condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once chapter iii next morning 
having taken leave of no one but the count and not waiting for the ladies 
to appear prince andrew set off for home it was already the beginning of june 
when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old 
oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him in the forest the 
harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now 
all was thick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forest 
did not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the mood around were 
delicately green with fluffy young shoots the whole day had been hot somewhere a storm 
was gathering but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the road 
and the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in the shade 
the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the 
breeze everything was in blossom the nightingales trilled and their voices reverberated now near now 
far away here in this forest was that oak with which i agreed thought prince 
andrew where is it he again wondered gazing at the left side of the road 
and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought the 
old oak quite transfigured spreading out a canopy of sappy dark green foliage stood rapt 
and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun neither gnarled fingers nor old 
scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now through the 
hard century old bark even where there were no twigs leaves had sprouted such as 
one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced it is the same oak 
thought prince andrew and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling 
of joy and renewal all the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his 
memory austerlitz with the lofty heavens his dead reproachful face pierre at the ferry that 
girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that night itself and the moon 
and all this rushed suddenly to his mind life is not over at thirty one 
prince andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively is not enough for me to know what 
i have in must know it pierre and that young girl who wanted to fly 
away into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not be 
lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so that it 
may be reflected in them all and they and i may live in harmony on 
reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn and found all sorts 
of reasons for this decision a whole series of sensible and logical considerations showing it 
to be essential for him to go to petersburg and even to re enter the 
service kept springing up in his mind he could not now understand how he could 
ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as 
a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country 
could ever enter his head it now seemed clear to him that all his experience 
of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work 
and again played an active part in life he did not even remember how formerly 
on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments it had seemed obvious that he would 
be degrading himself if he now after the lessons he had had in life allowed 
himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness 
or love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey to ryazán he found 
the country dull his former pursuits no longer interested him and often when sitting alone 
in his study he got up went to the mirror and gazed a long time 
at his own face then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead 
lise who with hair curled à la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out 
of the gilt frame she did not now say those former terrible words to him 
but looked simply merrily and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing his arms behind 
him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as he reflected on those irrational 
inexpressible thoughts secret as a crime which altered his whole life and were connected with 
pierre with fame with the girl at the window the oak and beauty and love 
and if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold stern 
and above all unpleasantly logical dear princess mary entering at such a moment would say 
nicholas go out today very cold it were hot prince andrew would reply at such 
times very dryly to his sister could go out in his smock but as it 
is cold he must wear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that is 
what follows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who 
needs fresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme logic as if 
punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him at such moments princess 
mary would think how intellectual work dries men up chapter iv prince andrew arrived in 
petersburg in august 1809 it was the time when the youthful speránski was at the 
zenith of his fame and his reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy 
that same august the emperor was thrown from his calèche injured his leg and remained 
three weeks at peterhof receiving speránski every day and no one else at that time 
the two famous decrees were being prepared that so agitated court ranks and introducing examinations 
to qualify for the grades of collegiate assessor and state not merely these but a 
whole state constitution intended to change the existing order of government in russia legal administrative 
and financial from the council of state down to the district tribunals now those vague 
liberal dreams with which the emperor alexander had ascended the throne and which he had 
tried to put into effect with the aid of his associates czartorýski novosíltsev kochubéy and 
he himself in jest had called his comité de salut taking shape and being realized 
now all these men were replaced by speránski on the civil side and arakchéev on 
the military soon after his arrival prince andrew as a gentleman of the chamber presented 
himself at court and at a levee the emperor though he met him twice did 
not favor him with a single word it had always seemed to prince andrew before 
that he was antipathetic to the emperor and that the latter disliked his face and 
personality generally and in the cold repellent glance the emperor gave him he now found 
further confirmation of this surmise the courtiers explained the neglect of him by his displeasure 
at not having served since 1805 know myself that one cannot help sympathies and antipathies 
thought prince andrew it will not do to present my proposal for the reform of 
the army regulations to the emperor personally but the project will speak for itself he 
mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal a friend of his the 
field marshal made an appointment to see him received him graciously and promised to inform 
the emperor a few days later prince andrew received notice that he was to go 
to see the minister of war count arakchéev on the appointed day prince andrew entered 
count waiting room at nine in the morning he did not know arakchéev personally had 
never seen him and all he had heard of him inspired him with but little 
respect for the man is minister of war a man trusted by the emperor and 
i need not concern myself about his personal qualities he has been commissioned to consider 
my project so he alone can get it adopted thought prince andrew as he waited 
among a number of important and unimportant people in count waiting room during his service 
chiefly as an adjutant prince andrew had seen the anterooms of many important men and 
the different types of such rooms were well known to him count anteroom had quite 
a special character the faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an audience 
showed embarrassment and servility the faces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling 
of awkwardness covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves their situation and 
the person for whom they were waiting some walked thoughtfully up and down others whispered 
and laughed prince andrew heard the nickname and the words will give it to us 
hot in reference to count arakchéev one general an important personage evidently feeling offended at 
having to wait so long sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to 
himself but the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all of fear 
prince andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in his 
name but received an ironical look and was told that his turn would come in 
due course after some others had been shown in and out of the room by 
the adjutant on duty an officer who struck prince andrew by his humiliated and frightened 
air was admitted at that terrible door this audience lasted a long time then suddenly 
the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from the other side of the 
door and the pale face and trembling out and passed through the waiting room clutching 
his head after this prince andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on 
duty said in a whisper the right at the window prince andrew entered a plain 
tidy room and saw at the table a man of forty with a long waist 
a long closely cropped head deep wrinkles scowling brows above dull greenish hazel eyes and 
an overhanging red nose arakchéev turned his head toward him without looking at him is 
your petition asked arakchéev am not petitioning your excellency returned prince andrew quietly eyes turned 
toward him down said he bolkónski am not petitioning about anything his majesty the emperor 
has deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me see my dear sir 
i have read your project interrupted arakchéev uttering only the first words amiably and without 
looking at prince gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt are proposing new military laws 
there are many laws but no one to carry out the old ones nowadays everybody 
designs laws it is easier writing than doing came at his majesty the wish to 
learn from your excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum i have presented 
said prince andrew politely have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to 
the committee i do not approve of it said arakchéev rising and taking a paper 
from his writing table and he handed it to prince andrew across the paper was 
scrawled in pencil without capital letters misspelled and without punctuation constructed because resembles an imitation 
of the french military code and from the articles of war needlessly deviating what committee 
has the memorandum been referred inquired prince andrew the committee on army regulations and i 
have recommended that your honor should be appointed a member but without a salary prince 
andrew smiled want one member without salary repeated arakchéev have the honor eh call the 
next one who else is there he shouted bowing to prince andrew chapter v while 
waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee prince andrew looked up his 
former acquaintances particularly those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might 
need in petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve 
of a battle when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles 
where the future on which the fate of millions depended was being shaped from the 
irritation of the older men the curiosity of the uninitiated the reserve of the initiated 
the hurry and preoccupation of everyone and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose existence 
he learned every day he felt that now in 1809 here in petersburg a vast 
civil conflict was in preparation the commander in chief of which was a mysterious person 
he did not know but who was supposed to be a man of and this 
movement of reconstruction of which prince andrew had a vague idea and speránski its chief 
promoter began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly 
receded to a secondary place in his consciousness prince andrew was most favorably placed to 
secure good reception in the highest and most diverse petersburg circles of the day the 
reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him in the first place because he was reputed 
to be clever and very well read and secondly because by liberating his serfs he 
had obtained the reputation of being a liberal the party of the old and dissatisfied 
who censured the innovations turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the 
reforms simply because he was the son of his father the feminine society world welcomed 
him gladly because he was rich distinguished a good match and almost a newcomer with 
a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of 
his wife besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was 
that he had greatly improved during these last five years having softened and grown more 
manly lost his former affectation pride and contemptuous irony and acquired the serenity that comes 
with years people talked about him were interested in him and wanted to meet him 
the day after his interview with count arakchéev prince andrew spent the evening at count 
he told the count of his interview with síla andréevich kochubéy spoke of arakchéev by 
that nickname with the same vague irony prince andrew had noticed in the minister of 
anteroom cher even in this case you do without michael mikháylovich speránski he manages everything 
speak to him he has promised to come this evening has speránski to do with 
the army regulations asked prince andrew kochubéy shook his head smilingly as if surprised at 
simplicity were talking to him about you a few days ago kochubéy continued about your 
freed plowmen is it you prince who have freed your serfs said an old man 
of day turning contemptuously toward bolkónski was a small estate that brought in no profit 
replied prince andrew trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old 
man uselessly of being late said the old man looking at kochubéy one thing i 
understand he continued will plow the land if they are set free it is easy 
to write laws but difficult to rule just the same as ask you will be 
heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations who pass the examinations i 
suppose replied kochubéy crossing his legs and glancing round i have pryánichnikov serving under me 
a splendid man a priceless man but sixty is he to go up for examination 
a difficulty as education is not at all general but count kochubéy did not finish 
he rose took prince andrew by the arm and went to meet a tall bald 
fair man of about forty with a large open forehead and a long face of 
unusual and peculiar whiteness who was just entering the newcomer wore a blue swallow tail 
coat with a cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast 
it was speránski prince andrew recognized him at once and felt a throb within him 
as happens at critical moments of life whether it was from respect envy or anticipation 
he did not know whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily 
recognizable in the society in which prince andrew lived he had never seen anyone who 
together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and self assurance he had never 
seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half closed rather humid 
eyes or so firm a smile that expressed nothing nor had he heard such a 
refined smooth soft voice above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face 
or which were broad but very plump soft and white such whiteness and softness prince 
andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in hospital 
this was speránski secretary of state reporter to the emperor and his companion at erfurt 
where he had more than once met and talked with napoleon speránski did not shift 
his eyes from one face to another as people involuntarily do on entering a large 
company and was in no hurry to speak he spoke slowly with assurance that he 
would be listened to and he looked only at the person with whom he was 
conversing prince andrew followed every word and movement with particular attention as happens to some 
people especially to men who judge those near to them severely he always on meeting 
anyone anyone whom like speránski he knew by to discover in him the perfection of 
human qualities speránski told kochubéy he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner 
as he had been detained at the palace he did not say that the emperor 
had kept him and prince andrew noticed this affectation of modesty when kochubéy introduced prince 
andrew speránski slowly turned his eyes to bolkónski with his customary smile and looked at 
him in silence am very glad to make your acquaintance i had heard of you 
as everyone has he said after a pause kochubéy said a few words about the 
reception arakchéev had given bolkónski speránski smiled more markedly chairman of the committee on army 
regulations is my good friend monsieur magnítski he said fully articulating every word and syllable 
if you like i can put you in touch with him he paused at the 
full stop hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to co operate in promoting 
all that is reasonable a circle soon formed round speránski and the old man who 
had talked about his subordinate pryánichnikov addressed a question to him prince andrew without joining 
in the conversation watched every movement of this man not long since an insignificant divinity 
student who now bolkónski thought held in his plump white fate of russia prince andrew 
was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which speránski answered the old man he 
appeared to address condescending words to him from an immeasurable height when the old man 
began to speak too loud speránski smiled and said he could not judge of the 
advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign having talked for a little while in 
the general circle speránski rose and coming up to prince andrew took him along to 
the other end of the room it was clear that he thought it necessary to 
interest himself in bolkónski had no chance to talk with you prince during the animated 
conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me he said with a mildly contemptuous smile 
as if intimating by that smile that he and prince andrew understood the insignificance of 
the people with whom he had just been talking this flattered prince andrew have known 
of you for a long time first from your action with regard to your serfs 
a first example of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators 
and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not 
considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers which is 
causing so much gossip and tittle tattle said prince andrew father did not wish me 
to take advantage of the privilege i began the service from the lower grade father 
a man of the last century evidently stands above our contemporaries who so condemn this 
measure which merely re establishes natural justice think however that these condemnations have some ground 
returned prince andrew trying to resist influence of which he began to be conscious he 
did not like to agree with him in everything and felt a wish to contradict 
though he usually spoke easily and well he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now 
while talking with speránski he was too much absorbed in observing the famous personality of 
personal ambition maybe speránski put in quietly of state interest to some extent said prince 
andrew do you mean asked speránski quietly lowering his eyes am an admirer of montesquieu 
replied prince andrew his idea that le principe des monarchies est me paraît incontestable certains 
droits et privilèges de la noblesse me paraissent être des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment 
principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable certain rights and privileges for the 
aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that sentiment the smile vanished from white 
face which was much improved by the change probably prince thought interested him vous envisagez 
la question sous ce point de vue he began pronouncing french with evident difficulty and 
speaking even slower than in russian but quite calmly you regard the question from that 
point of view speránski went on to say that honor cannot be upheld by privileges 
harmful to the service that honor is either a negative concept of not doing what 
is blameworthy or it is a source of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards 
which recognize it his arguments were concise simple and clear institution upholding honor the source 
of emulation is one similar to the légion of the great emperor napoleon not harmful 
but helpful to the success of the service but not a class or court privilege 
do not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court privileges have attained the 
same end returned prince andrew courtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily you 
do not care to avail yourself of the privilege prince said speránski indicating by a 
smile that he wished to finish amiably an argument which was embarrassing for his companion 
you will do me the honor of calling on me on wednesday he added will 
after talking with magnítski let you know what may interest you and shall also have 
the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you closing his eyes he bowed à 
la française without taking leave and trying to attract as little attention as possible he 
left the room chapter vi during the first weeks of his stay in petersburg prince 
andrew felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion 
quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city on returning home 
in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary calls 
or appointments for certain hours the mechanism of life the arrangement of the day so 
as to be in time everywhere absorbed the greater part of his vital energy he 
did nothing did not even think or find time to think but only talked and 
talked successfully of what he had thought while in the country he sometimes noticed with 
dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark on the same day in different circles but 
he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice 
that he was thinking of nothing as he had done on their first meeting at 
speránski produced a strong impression on prince andrew on the wednesday when he received him 
tête à tête at his own house and talked to him long and confidentially to 
bolkónski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant creatures and he so longed to find 
in someone the living ideal of that perfection toward which he strove that he readily 
believed that in speránski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous 
man had speránski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed the same breeding 
and traditions bolkónski would soon have discovered his weak human unheroic sides but as it 
was strange and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because 
he did not quite understand him moreover speránski either because he appreciated the capacity or 
because he considered it necessary to win him to his side showed off his dispassionate 
calm reasonableness before prince andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes hand 
in hand with self assurance and consists in a tacit assumption that companion is the 
only man besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and 
the reasonableness and profundity of own ideas during their long conversation on wednesday evening speránski 
more than once remarked regard everything that is above the common level of rooted custom 
or with a smile we want the wolves to be fed and the sheep to 
be safe or cannot understand this and all in a way that seemed to say 
you and i understand what they are and who we are this first long conversation 
with speránski only strengthened in prince andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at 
their first meeting he saw in him a remarkable clear thinking man of vast intellect 
who by his energy and persistence had attained power which he was using solely for 
the welfare of russia in prince eyes speránski was the man he would himself have 
wished to who explained all the facts of life reasonably considered important only what was 
rational and was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything everything seemed so 
simple and clear in exposition that prince andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything if 
he replied and argued it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and 
not submit to opinions entirely everything was right and everything was as it should be 
only one thing disconcerted prince andrew this was cold mirrorlike look which did not allow 
one to penetrate to his soul and his delicate white hands which prince andrew involuntarily 
watched as one does watch the hands of those who possess power this mirrorlike gaze 
and those delicate hands irritated prince andrew he knew not why he was unpleasantly struck 
too by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in speránski and by the 
diversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions he made use of 
every kind of mental device except analogy and passed too boldly it seemed to prince 
andrew from one to another now he would take up the position of a practical 
man and condemn dreamers now that of a satirist and laugh ironically at his opponents 
now grow severely logical or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics this last resource 
was one he very frequently employed he would transfer a question to metaphysical heights pass 
on to definitions of space time and thought and having deduced the refutation he needed 
would again descend to the level of the original discussion in general the trait of 
mentality which struck prince andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power 
and authority of reason it was evident that the thought could never occur to him 
which to prince andrew seemed so natural namely that it is after all impossible to 
express all one thinks and that he had never felt the doubt not all i 
think and believe nonsense and it was just this peculiarity of mind that particularly attracted 
prince andrew during the first period of their acquaintance bolkónski felt a passionate admiration for 
him similar to that which he had once felt for bonaparte the fact that speránski 
was the son of a village priest and that stupid people might meanly despise him 
on account of his humble origin as in fact many did caused prince andrew to 
cherish his sentiment for him the more and unconsciously to strengthen it on that first 
evening bolkónski spent with him having mentioned the commission for the revision of the code 
of laws speránski told him sarcastically that the commission had existed for a hundred and 
fifty years had cost millions and had done nothing except that rosenkampf had stuck labels 
on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes that is all the state has for 
the millions it has spent said he want to give the senate new juridical powers 
but we have no laws that is why it is a sin for men like 
you prince not to serve in these times prince andrew said that for that work 
an education in jurisprudence was needed which he did not possess nobody possesses it so 
what would you have it is a vicious circle from which we must break a 
way out a week later prince andrew was a member of the committee on army 
regulations he had not at all chairman of a section of the committee for the 
revision of the laws at request he took the first part of the civil code 
that was being drawn up and with the aid of the code napoléon and the 
institutes of justinian he worked at formulating the section on personal rights chapter vii nearly 
two years before this in 1808 pierre on returning to petersburg after visiting his estates 
had involuntarily found himself in a leading position among the petersburg freemasons he arranged dining 
and funeral lodge meetings enrolled new members and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring 
authentic charters he gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented as far as 
he could the collection of alms in regard to which the majority of members were 
stingy and irregular he supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in petersburg 
his life meanwhile continued as before with the same infatuations and dissipations he liked to 
dine and drink well and though he considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist 
the temptations of the bachelor circles in which he moved amid the turmoil of his 
activities and distractions however pierre at the end of a year began to feel that 
the more firmly he tried to rest upon it the more masonic ground on which 
he stood gave way under him at the same time he felt that the deeper 
the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order when 
he had joined the freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps 
onto the smooth surface of a bog when he put his foot down it sank 
in to make quite sure of the firmness of the ground he put his other 
foot down and sank deeper still became stuck in it and involuntarily waded knee deep 
in the bog joseph alexéevich was not in had of late stood aside from the 
affairs of the petersburg lodges and lived almost entirely in moscow all the members of 
the lodges were men pierre knew in ordinary life and it was difficult for him 
to regard them merely as brothers in freemasonry and not as prince b or iván 
vasílevich d whom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men under the 
masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in 
ordinary life often after collecting alms and reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for 
the most part in promises from a dozen members of whom half were as well 
able to pay as himself pierre remembered the masonic vow in which each brother promised 
to devote all his belongings to his neighbor and doubts on which he tried not 
to dwell arose in his soul he divided the brothers he knew into four categories 
in the first he put those who did not take an active part in the 
affairs of the lodges or in human affairs but were exclusively occupied with the mystical 
science of the order with questions of the threefold designation of god the three primordial 
mercury and the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple 
of solomon pierre respected this class of brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged 
including pierre thought joseph alexéevich himself but he did not share their interests his heart 
was not in the mystical aspect of freemasonry in the second category pierre reckoned himself 
and others like him seeking and vacillating who had not yet found in freemasonry a 
straight and comprehensible path but hoped to do so in the third category he included 
those brothers the majority who saw nothing in freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies 
and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance 
such were willarski and even the grand master of the principal lodge finally to the 
fourth category also a great many brothers belonged particularly those who had lately joined these 
according to observations were men who had no belief in anything nor desire for anything 
but joined the freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young brothers who were influential 
through their connections or rank and of whom there were very many in the lodge 
pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing freemasonry at any rate as 
he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals he did not 
think of doubting freemasonry itself but suspected that russian masonry had taken a wrong path 
and deviated from its original principles and so toward the end of the year he 
went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order in the summer 
of 1809 pierre returned to petersburg our freemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that 
bezúkhov had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons had been initiated into many 
mysteries had been raised to a higher grade and was bringing back with him much 
that might conduce to the advantage of the masonic cause in russia the petersburg freemasons 
all came to see him tried to ingratiate themselves with him and it seemed to 
them all that he was preparing something for them and concealing it a solemn meeting 
of the lodge of the second degree was convened at which pierre promised to communicate 
to the petersburg brothers what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders 
of their order the meeting was a full one after the usual ceremonies pierre rose 
and began his address brothers he began blushing and stammering with a written speech in 
his hand is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in the seclusion of our must 
we are drowsing but we must act pierre raised his notebook and began to read 
the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of virtue he read must 
cleanse men from prejudice diffuse principles in harmony with the spirit of the times undertake 
the education of the young unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the wisest men boldly 
yet prudently overcome superstitions infidelity and folly and form of those devoted to us a 
body linked together by unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power attain this 
end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice and must endeavor to secure 
that the honest man may even in this world receive a lasting reward for his 
virtue but in these great endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of 
today what is to be done in these circumstances to favor revolutions overthrow everything repel 
force by force no we are very far from that every violent reform deserves censure 
for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are and also 
because wisdom needs no violence whole plan of our order should be based on the 
idea of preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of at the 
punishment of vice and folly and patronizing talent and virtue raising worthy men from the 
dust and attaching them to our brotherhood only then will our order have the power 
unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to control them without 
their being aware of it in a word we must found a form of government 
holding universal sway which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds 
of citizenship and beside which all other governments can continue in their customary course and 
do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order which is to obtain 
for virtue the victory over vice this aim was that of christianity itself it taught 
men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow the example 
and instruction of the best and wisest men that time when everything was plunged in 
darkness preaching alone was of course sufficient the novelty of truth endowed her with special 
strength but now we need much more powerful methods it is now necessary that man 
governed by his senses should find in virtue a charm palpable to those senses it 
is impossible to eradicate the passions but we must strive to direct them to a 
noble aim and it is therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his 
passions within the limits of virtue our order should provide means to that end soon 
as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state each of them 
again training two others and all being closely united everything will be possible for our 
order which has already in secret accomplished much for the welfare of mankind this speech 
not only made a strong impression but created excitement in the lodge the majority of 
the brothers seeing in it dangerous designs of illuminism met it with a coldness that 
surprised pierre the grand master began answering him and pierre began developing his views with 
more and more warmth it was long since there had been so stormy a meeting 
parties were formed some accusing pierre of illuminism others supporting him at that meeting he 
was struck for the first time by the endless variety of minds which prevents a 
truth from ever presenting itself identically to two persons even those members who seemed to 
be on his side understood him in their own way with limitations and alterations he 
could not agree to as what he always wanted most was to convey his thought 
to others just as he himself understood it the illuminati sought to substitute republican for 
monarchical institutions at the end of the meeting the grand master with irony and ill 
will reproved bezúkhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue alone 
but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute pierre did 
not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would be accepted he was told 
that it would not and without waiting for the usual formalities he left the lodge 
and went home chapter viii again pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded 
for three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on 
a sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere it was just then that 
he received a letter from his wife who implored him to see her telling him 
how grieved she was about him and how she wished to devote her whole life 
to him at the end of the letter she informed him that in a few 
days she would return to petersburg from abroad following this letter one of the masonic 
brothers whom pierre respected less than the others forced his way in to see him 
and turning the conversation upon matrimonial affairs by way of fraternal advice expressed the opinion 
that his severity to his wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of 
the first rules of freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent at the same time his 
mother in law prince wife sent to him imploring him to come if only for 
a few minutes to discuss a most important matter pierre saw that there was a 
conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife and in 
the mood he then was this was not even unpleasant to him nothing mattered to 
him nothing in life seemed to him of much importance and under the influence of 
the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish 
his wife one is right and no one is to blame so she too is 
not to blame he thought if he did not at once give his consent to 
a reunion with his wife it was only because in his state of depression he 
did not feel able to take any step had his wife come to him he 
would not have turned her away compared to what preoccupied him was it not a 
matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not without replying either to 
his wife or his mother in law pierre late one night prepared for a journey 
and started for moscow to see joseph alexéevich this is what he noted in his 
diary moscow 17th november i have just returned from my benefactor and hasten to write 
down what i have experienced joseph alexéevich is living poorly and has for three years 
been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder no one has ever heard him 
utter a groan or a word of complaint from morning till late at night except 
when he eats his very plain food he is working at science he received me 
graciously and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay i made 
the sign of the knights of the east and of jerusalem and he responded in 
the same manner asking me with a mild smile what i had learned and gained 
in the prussian and scottish lodges i told him everything as best i could and 
told him what i had proposed to our petersburg lodge of the bad reception i 
had encountered and of my rupture with the brothers joseph alexéevich having remained silent and 
thoughtful for a good while told me his view of the matter which at once 
lit up for me my whole past and the future path i should follow he 
surprised me by asking whether i remembered the threefold aim of the order 1 the 
preservation and study of the mystery 2 the purification and reformation of oneself for its 
reception and 3 the improvement of the human race by striving for such purification which 
is the principal aim of these three certainly self reformation and self purification only to 
this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances but at the same time just 
this aim demands the greatest efforts of us and so led astray by pride losing 
sight of this aim we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity 
we are unworthy to receive or seek the reformation of the human race while ourselves 
setting an example of baseness and profligacy illuminism is not a pure doctrine just because 
it is attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride on this ground joseph 
alexéevich condemned my speech and my whole activity and in the depth of my soul 
i agreed with him talking of my family affairs he said to me chief duty 
of a true mason as i have told you lies in perfecting himself we often 
think that by removing all the difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach 
our aim but on the contrary my dear sir it is only in the midst 
of worldly cares that we can attain our three chief aims 1 self man can 
only know himself by comparison 2 self perfecting which can only be attained by conflict 
and 3 the attainment of the chief of death only the vicissitudes of life can 
show us its vanity and develop our innate love of death or of rebirth to 
a new life these words are all the more remarkable because in spite of his 
great physical sufferings joseph alexéevich is never weary of life though he loves death for 
spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner does not yet feel himself sufficiently 
prepared my benefactor then explained to me fully the meaning of the great square of 
creation and pointed out to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis 
of everything he advised me not to avoid intercourse with the petersburg brothers but to 
take up only second grade posts in the lodge to try while diverting the brothers 
from pride to turn them toward the true path self knowledge and self perfecting besides 
this he advised me for myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself 
and to that end he gave me a notebook the one i am now writing 
in and in which i will in future note down all my actions petersburg 23rd 
november i am again living with my wife my mother in law came to me 
in tears and said that hélène was here and that she implored me to hear 
her that she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion and much more i knew 
that if i once let myself see her i should not have strength to go 
on refusing what she wanted in my perplexity i did not know whose aid and 
advice to seek had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to 
do i went to my room and reread joseph letters and recalled my conversations with 
him and deduced from it all that i ought not to refuse a supplicant and 
ought to reach a helping hand to to one so closely bound to that i 
must bear my cross but if i forgive her for the sake of doing right 
then let union with her have only a spiritual aim that is what i decided 
and what i wrote to joseph alexéevich i told my wife that i begged her 
to forget the past to forgive me whatever wrong i may have done her and 
that i had nothing to forgive it gave me joy to tell her this she 
need not know how hard it was for me to see her again i have 
settled on the upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling 
of regeneration chapter ix at that time as always happens the highest society that met 
at court and at the grand balls was divided into several circles each with its 
own particular tone the largest of these was the french circle of the napoleonic alliance 
the circle of count rumyántsev and caulaincourt in this group hélène as soon as she 
had settled in petersburg with her husband took a very prominent place she was visited 
by the members of the french embassy and by many belonging to that circle and 
noted for their intellect and polished manners hélène had been at erfurt during the famous 
meeting of the emperors and had brought from there these connections with the napoleonic notabilities 
at erfurt her success had been brilliant napoleon himself had noticed her in the theater 
and said of her un superbe animal her success as a beautiful and elegant woman 
did not surprise pierre for she had become even handsomer than before what did surprise 
him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded in gaining the 
reputation une femme charmante aussi spirituelle que belle 2 the distinguished prince de ligne wrote 
her eight page letters bilíbin saved up his epigrams to produce them in countess presence 
to be received in the countess salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect young 
men read books before attending evenings to have something to say in her salon and 
secretaries of the embassy and even ambassadors confided diplomatic secrets to her so that in 
a way hélène was a power pierre who knew she was very stupid sometimes attended 
with a strange feeling of perplexity and fear her evenings and dinner parties where politics 
poetry and philosophy were discussed at these parties his feelings were like those of a 
conjuror who always expects his trick to be found out at any moment but whether 
because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a salon or because those 
who were deceived found pleasure in the deception at any rate it remained unexposed and 
hélène reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established that she could 
say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody would go into raptures over every word 
of hers and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had 
no conception a superb animal 2 a charming woman as witty as she is lovely 
pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman he was that absent 
minded crank a grand seigneur husband who was in no way and far from spoiling 
the high tone and general impression of the drawing room he served by the contrast 
he presented to her as an advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife pierre 
during the last two years as a result of his continual absorption in abstract interests 
and his sincere contempt for all else had acquired in his circle which did not 
interest him that air of unconcern indifference and benevolence toward all which cannot be acquired 
artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect he entered his drawing room as one enters a 
theater was acquainted with everybody equally pleased to see everyone and equally indifferent to them 
all sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him and regardless of whether any 
of the were present or not lispingly expressed his views which were sometimes not at 
all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment but the general opinion concerning 
the queer husband of most distinguished woman in was so well established that no one 
took his freaks seriously among the many young men who frequented her house every day 
borís drubetskóy who had already achieved great success in the service was the most intimate 
friend of the bezúkhov household since return from erfurt hélène spoke of him as and 
treated him like a child her smile for him was the same as for everybody 
but sometimes that smile made pierre uncomfortable toward him borís behaved with a particularly dignified 
and sad deference this shade of deference also disturbed pierre he had suffered so painfully 
three years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he 
now protected himself from the danger of its repetition first by not being a husband 
to his wife and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect now that she has 
become a bluestocking she has finally renounced her former infatuations he told himself has never 
been an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the statement which 
though gathered from an unknown source he believed implicitly yet strange to say presence in 
his drawing room and he was almost always there had a physical effect upon pierre 
it constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of his movements a strange 
antipathy thought pierre i used to like him very much in the eyes of the 
world pierre was a great gentleman the rather blind and absurd husband of a distinguished 
wife a clever crank who did nothing but harmed nobody and was a first rate 
good natured fellow but a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place 
all this time in soul revealing much to him and causing him many spiritual doubts 
and joys chapter x pierre went on with his diary and this is what he 
wrote in it during that time 24th november got up at eight read the scriptures 
then went to my duties by joseph advice pierre had entered the service of the 
state and served on one of the committees returned home for dinner and dined countess 
had many visitors i do not like i ate and drank moderately and after dinner 
copied out some passages for the brothers in the evening i went down to the 
countess and told a funny story about b and only remembered that i ought not 
to have done so when everybody laughed loudly at it i am going to bed 
with a happy and tranquil mind great god help me to walk in thy paths 
1 to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation 2 to vanquish lust by self restraint 
and repulsion 3 to withdraw from worldliness but not avoid a the service of the 
state b family duties c relations with my friends and the management of my affairs 
27th november i got up late on waking i lay long in bed yielding to 
sloth o god help and strengthen me that i may walk in thy ways read 
the scriptures but without proper feeling brother urúsov came and we talked about worldly vanities 
he told me of the new projects i began to criticize them but remembered my 
rules and my a true freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when 
his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist my 
tongue is my enemy brothers g v and o visited me and we had a 
preliminary talk about the reception of a new brother they laid on me the duty 
of rhetor i feel myself weak and unworthy then our talk turned to the interpretation 
of the seven pillars and steps of the temple the seven sciences the seven virtues 
the seven vices and the seven gifts of the holy spirit brother o was very 
eloquent in the evening the admission took place the new decoration of the premises contributed 
much to the magnificence of the spectacle it was borís drubetskóy who was admitted i 
nominated him and was the rhetor a strange feeling agitated me all the time i 
was alone with him in the dark chamber i caught myself harboring a feeling of 
hatred toward him which i vainly tried to overcome that is why i should really 
like to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth but 
evil thoughts of him did not leave me it seemed to me that his object 
in entering the brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of 
our lodge apart from the fact that he had asked me several times whether n 
and s were members of our lodge a question to which i could not reply 
and that according to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our holy 
order and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement 
i had no cause to doubt him but he seemed to me insincere and all 
the time i stood alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me 
that he was smiling contemptuously at my words and i wished really to stab his 
bare breast with the sword i held to it i could not be eloquent nor 
could i frankly mention my doubts to the brothers and to the grand master great 
architect of nature help me to find the true path out of the labyrinth of 
lies after this three pages were left blank in the diary and then the following 
was written i have had a long and instructive talk alone with brother v who 
advised me to hold fast by brother a though i am unworthy much was revealed 
to me adonai is the name of the creator of the world elohim is the 
name of the ruler of all the third name is the name unutterable which means 
the all talks with brother v strengthen refresh and support me in the path of 
virtue in his presence doubt has no place the distinction between the poor teachings of

elements of sulphur mercury and salt sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature in 
combination with salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by 
means of which it attracts mercury seizes it holds it and in combination produces other 
bodies mercury is a fluid volatile spiritual essence christ the holy spirit him 3rd december 
awoke late read the scriptures but was apathetic afterwards went and paced up and down 
the large hall i wished to meditate but instead my imagination pictured an occurrence of 
four years ago when dólokhov meeting me in moscow after our duel said he hoped 
i was enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my absence at the time 
i gave him no answer now i recalled every detail of that meeting and in 
my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies i recollected myself and drove 
away that thought only when i found myself glowing with anger but i did not 
sufficiently repent afterwards borís drubetskóy came and began relating various adventures his coming vexed me 
from the first and i said something disagreeable to him he replied i flared up 
and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him he became silent and 
i recollected myself only when it was too late my god i cannot get on 
with him at all the cause of this is my egotism i set myself above 
him and so become much worse than he for he is lenient to my rudeness 
while i on the contrary nourish contempt for him o god grant that in his 
presence i may rather see my own vileness and behave so that he too may 
benefit after dinner i fell asleep and as i was drowsing off i clearly heard 
a voice saying in my left ear day i dreamed that i was walking in 
the dark and was suddenly surrounded by dogs but i went on undismayed suddenly a 
smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go i 
began to throttle it with my hands scarcely had i torn it off before another 
a bigger one began biting me i lifted it up but the higher i lifted 
it the bigger and heavier it grew and suddenly brother a came and taking my 
arm led me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a 
narrow plank i stepped on it but it bent and gave way and i began 
to clamber up a fence which i could scarcely reach with my hands after much 
effort i dragged myself up so that my leg hung down on one side and 
my body on the other i looked round and saw brother a standing on the 
fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden and in the garden was 
a large and beautiful building i woke up o lord great architect of nature help 
me to tear from myself these passions especially the last which unites in itself the 
strength of all the former ones and aid me to enter that temple of virtue 
to a vision of which i attained in my dream 7th december i dreamed that 
joseph alexéevich was sitting in my house and that i was very glad and wished 
to entertain him it seemed as if i chattered incessantly with other people and suddenly 
remembered that this could not please him and i wished to come close to him 
and embrace him but as soon as i drew near i saw that his face 
had changed and grown young and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching 
of our order but so softly that i could not hear it then it seemed 
that we all left the room and something strange happened we were sitting or lying 
on the floor he was telling me something and i wished to show him my 
sensibility and not listening to what he was saying i began picturing to myself the 
condition of my inner man and the grace of god sanctifying me and tears came 
into my eyes and i was glad he noticed this but he looked at me 
with vexation and jumped up breaking off his remarks i felt abashed and asked whether 
what he had been saying did not concern me but he did not reply gave 
me a kind look and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there 
is a double bed he lay down on the edge of it and i burned 
with longing to caress him and lie down too and he said me frankly what 
is your chief temptation do you know it i think you know it already abashed 
by this question i replied that sloth was my chief temptation he shook his head 
incredulously and even more abashed i said that though i was living with my wife 
as he advised i was not living with her as her husband to this he 
replied that one should not deprive a wife of embraces and gave me to understand 
that that was my duty but i replied that i should be ashamed to do 
it and suddenly everything vanished and i awoke and found in my mind the text 
from the gospel life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness 
and the darkness comprehended it not joseph face had looked young and bright that day 
i received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about duties 9th december 
i had a dream from which i awoke with a throbbing heart i saw that 
i was in moscow in my house in the big sitting room and joseph alexéevich 
came in from the drawing room i seemed to know at once that the process 
of regeneration had already taken place in him and i rushed to meet him i 
embraced him and kissed his hands and he said thou noticed that my face is 
different i looked at him still holding him in my arms and saw that his 
face was young but that he had no hair on his head and his features 
were quite changed and i said should have known you had i met you by 
chance and i thought to myself i telling the truth and suddenly i saw him 
lying like a dead body then he gradually recovered and went with me into my 
study carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper i said drew that and 
he answered by bowing his head i opened the book and on all the pages 
there were excellent drawings and in my dream i knew that these drawings represented the 
love adventures of the soul with its beloved and on its pages i saw a 
beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent garments and with a transparent body flying up 
to the clouds and i seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than 
a representation of the song of songs and looking at those drawings i dreamed i 
felt that i was doing wrong but could not tear myself away from them lord 
help me my god if thy forsaking me is thy doing thy will be done 
but if i am myself the cause teach me what i should do i shall 
perish of my debauchery if thou utterly desertest me chapter xi the monetary affairs had 
not improved during the two years they had spent in the country though nicholas rostóv 
had kept firmly to his resolution and was still serving modestly in an obscure regiment 
spending comparatively little the way of life at management of affairs in such that the 
debts inevitably increased every year the only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count 
was to apply for an official post so he had come to petersburg to look 
for one and also as he said to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the 
last time soon after their arrival in petersburg berg proposed to véra and was accepted 
though in moscow the rostóvs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a 
thought yet in petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one in 
petersburg they were provincials and the very people they had entertained in moscow without inquiring 
to what set they belonged here looked down on them the rostóvs lived in the 
same hospitable way in petersburg as in moscow and the most diverse people met at 
their suppers country neighbors from otrádnoe impoverished old squires and their daughters perónskaya a maid 
of honor pierre bezúkhov and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a 
post in petersburg among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the house 
in petersburg were borís pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged 
home with him and berg who spent whole days at the and paid the eldest 
daughter countess véra the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose not 
in vain had berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at austerlitz and held a 
perfectly unnecessary sword in his left he narrated that episode so persistently and with so 
important an air that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed and 
he had obtained two decorations for austerlitz in the finnish war he also managed to 
distinguish himself he had picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an 
aide de camp standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his 
commander just as he had done after austerlitz he related this occurrence at such length 
and so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this and 
he received two decorations for the finnish war also in 1809 he was a captain 
in the guards wore medals and held some special lucrative posts in petersburg though some 
skeptics smiled when told of merits it could not be denied that he was a 
painstaking and brave officer on excellent terms with his superiors and a moral young man 
with a brilliant career before him and an assured position in society four years before 
meeting a german comrade in the stalls of a moscow theater berg had pointed out 
véra rostóva to him and had said in german soll mein weib werden and from 
that moment had made up his mind to marry her now in petersburg having considered 
the position and his own he decided that the time had come to propose girl 
shall be my wife proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not 
flattering to him at first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure livonian 
gentleman should propose marriage to a countess rostóva but chief characteristic was such a naïve 
and good natured egotism that the rostóvs involuntarily came to think it would be a 
good thing since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good indeed excellent 
moreover the affairs were seriously embarrassed as the suitor could not but know and above 
all véra was twenty four had been taken out everywhere and though she was certainly 
good looking and sensible no one up to now had proposed to her so they 
gave their consent see said berg to his comrade whom he called only because he 
knew that everyone has friends see i have considered it all and should not marry 
if i had not thought it all out or if it were in any way 
unsuitable but on the contrary my papa and mamma are now provided have arranged that 
rent for them in the baltic i can live in petersburg on my pay and 
with her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely i am not 
marrying for consider that a wife should bring her share and a husband his i 
have my position in the service she has connections and some means in our times 
that is worth something it but above all she is a handsome estimable girl and 
she loves me berg blushed and smiled i love her because her character is sensible 
and very good now the other sister though they are the same family is quite 
unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence she is so you know unpleasant but 
my fiancée well you will be coming he was going to say dine but changed 
his mind and said take tea with us and quickly doubling up his tongue he 
blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke perfectly embodying his dream of happiness after 
the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by proposal the holiday tone of 
joyousness usual at such times took possession of the family but the rejoicing was external 
and insincere in the feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was evident 
as if they were ashamed of not having loved véra sufficiently and of being so 
ready to get her off their hands the old count felt this most he would 
probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment but it resulted from 
the state of his affairs he did not know at all how much he had 
what his debts amounted to or what dowry he could give véra when his daughters 
were born he had assigned to each of them for her dowry an estate with 
three hundred serfs but one of these estates had already been sold and the other 
was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would have to be 
sold so that it was impossible to give it to véra nor had he any 
money berg had already been engaged a month and only a week remained before the 
wedding but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of 
the dowry nor spoken to his wife about it at one time the count thought 
of giving her the ryazán estate or of selling a forest at another time of 
borrowing money on a note of hand a few days before the wedding berg entered 
the study early one morning and with a pleasant smile respectfully asked his future father 
in law to let him know what dowry would be the count was so disconcerted 
by this long foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply that came 
into his head like your being businesslike about it i like it you shall be 
satisfied and patting berg on the shoulder he got up wishing to end the conversation 
but berg smiling pleasantly explained that if he did not know for certain how much 
véra would have and did not receive at least part of the dowry in advance 
he would have to break matters off consider i allowed myself to marry now without 
having definite means to maintain my wife i should be acting badly the conversation ended 
by the count who wished to be generous and to avoid further importunity saying that 
he would give a note of hand for eighty thousand rubles berg smiled meekly kissed 
the count on the shoulder and said that he was very grateful but that it 
was impossible for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in ready 
money at least twenty thousand count he added then a note of hand for only 
sixty thousand yes all right said the count hurriedly excuse me my dear fellow give 
you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty thousand as well yes yes 
kiss me chapter xii natásha was sixteen and it was the year 1809 the very 
year to which she had counted on her fingers with borís after they had kissed 
four years ago since then she had not seen him before sónya and her mother 
if borís happened to be mentioned she spoke quite freely of that episode as of 
some childish long forgotten matter that was not worth mentioning but in the secret depths 
of her soul the question whether her engagement to borís was a jest or an 
important binding promise tormented her since borís left moscow in 1805 to join the army 
he had not seen the rostóvs he had been in moscow several times and had 
passed near otrádnoe but had never been to see them sometimes it occurred to natásha 
that he did not wish to see her and this conjecture was confirmed by the 
sad tone in which her elders spoke of him old friends are not remembered the 
countess would say when borís was mentioned anna mikháylovna also had of late visited them 
less frequently seemed to hold herself with particular dignity and always spoke rapturously and gratefully 
of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on which he had entered 
when the rostóvs came to petersburg borís called on them he drove to their house 
in some agitation the memory of natásha was his most poetic recollection but he went 
with the firm intention of letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations 
between himself and natásha could not be binding either on her or on him he 
had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with countess bezúkhova a brilliant 
position in the service thanks to the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence 
he enjoyed and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest 
heiresses in petersburg plans which might very easily be realized when he entered the drawing 
room natásha was in her own room when she heard of his arrival she almost 
ran into the drawing room flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile borís 
remembered natásha in a short dress with dark eyes shining from under her curls and 
boisterous childish laughter as he had known her four years before and so he was 
taken aback when quite a different natásha entered and his face expressed rapturous astonishment this 
expression on his face pleased natásha do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked the 
countess borís kissed hand and said that he was astonished at the change in her 
handsome you have grown should think so replied laughing eyes is papa older she asked 
natásha sat down and without joining in conversation with the countess silently and minutely studied 
her suitor he felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at 
her occasionally uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were all comme 
il faut and in the latest fashion this natásha noticed at once he sat rather 
sideways in the armchair next to the countess arranging with his right hand the cleanest 
of gloves that fitted his left hand like a skin and he spoke with a 
particularly refined compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest petersburg society recalling 
with mild irony old times in moscow and moscow acquaintances it was not accidentally natásha 
felt that he alluded when speaking of the highest aristocracy to an ball he had 
attended and to invitations he had received from n n and s s all this 
time natásha sat silent glancing up at him from under her brows this gaze disturbed 
and confused borís more and more he looked round more frequently toward her and broke 
off in what he was saying he did not stay more than ten minutes then 
rose and took his leave the same inquisitive challenging and rather mocking eyes still looked 
at him after his first visit borís said to himself that natásha attracted him just 
as much as ever but that he must not yield to that feeling because to 
marry her a girl almost without fortune would mean ruin to his career while to 
renew their former relations without intending to marry her would be dishonorable borís made up 
his mind to avoid meeting natásha but despite that resolution he called again a few 
days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the it seemed to 
him that he ought to have an explanation with natásha and tell her that the 
old times must be forgotten that in spite of everything she could not be his 
wife that he had no means and they would never let her marry him but 
he failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on such an explanation from 
day to day he became more and more entangled it seemed to her mother and 
sónya that natásha was in love with borís as of old she sang him his 
favorite songs showed him her album making him write in it did not allow him 
to allude to the past letting it be understood how delightful was the present and 
every day he went away in a fog without having said what he meant to 
and not knowing what he was doing or why he came or how it would 
all end he left off visiting hélène and received reproachful notes from her every day 
and yet he continued to spend whole days with the rostóvs chapter xiii one night 
when the old countess in nightcap and dressing jacket without her false curls and with 
her poor little knob of hair showing under her white cotton cap knelt sighing and 
groaning on a rug and bowing to the ground in prayer her door creaked and 
natásha also in a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair 
in curlpapers ran in the prayerful mood round and frowned she was finishing her last 
prayer it be that this couch will be my grave natásha flushed and eager seeing 
her mother in prayer suddenly checked her rush half sat down and unconsciously put out 
her tongue as if chiding herself seeing that her mother was still praying she ran 
on tiptoe to the bed and rapidly slipping one little foot against the other pushed 
off her slippers and jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her 
grave this couch was high with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than 
the one below natásha jumped on it sank into the feather bed rolled over to 
the wall and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled down raising her knees 
to her chin kicking out and laughing almost inaudibly now covering herself up head and 
all and now peeping at her mother the countess finished her prayers and came to 
the bed with a stern face but seeing that head was covered she smiled in 
her kind weak way then now then said she can we have a talk yes 
said natásha just one on your throat and another do and seizing her mother round 
the neck she kissed her on the throat in her behavior to her mother natásha 
seemed rough but she was so sensitive and tactful that however she clasped her mother 
she always managed to do it without hurting her or making her feel uncomfortable or 
displeased what is it tonight said the mother having arranged her pillows and waited until 
natásha after turning over a couple of times had settled down beside her under the 
quilt spread out her arms and assumed a serious expression these visits of at night 
before the count returned from his club were one of the greatest pleasures of both 
mother and daughter is it tonight i have to tell you natásha put her hand 
on her mouth borís i know she said seriously what i have come about say 
know no do tell me and she removed her hand me mamma nice you are 
sixteen at your age i was married you say borís is nice he is very 
nice and i love him like a son but what then what are you thinking 
about you have quite turned his head i can see that as she said this 
the countess looked round at her daughter natásha was lying looking steadily straight before her 
at one of the mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead so that 
the countess only saw her face in profile that face struck her by its peculiarly 
serious and concentrated expression natásha was listening and considering what then said she have quite 
turned his head and why what do you want of him you know you marry 
him not said natásha without changing her position he is young because he is poor 
because he is a relation and because you yourself love him do you know know 
it is not right darling if i want to said natásha off talking nonsense said 
the countess if i want to i am in earnest natásha did not let her 
finish she drew the large hand to her kissed it on the back and then 
on the palm then again turned it over and began kissing first one knuckle then 
the space between the knuckles then the next knuckle whispering february march april may speak 
mamma why you say anything speak said she turning to her mother who was tenderly 
gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had 
wished to say do my love not everyone will understand this friendship dating from your 
childish days and to see him so intimate with you may injure you in the 
eyes of other young men who visit us and above all it torments him for 
nothing he may already have found a suitable and wealthy match and now half crazy 
repeated natásha tell you some things about myself i had a cousin know cyril matvéich 
but he is old was not always old but this is what do natásha have 
a talk with borís he need not come so often not if he likes to 
i know it will end in nothing can you know no mamma speak to him 
what nonsense said natásha in the tone of one being deprived of her property i 
marry but let him come if he enjoys it and i enjoy it natásha smiled 
and looked at her mother to marry but just so she added so my pet 
so no need for me to marry him but just so so just so repeated 
the countess and shaking all over she went off into a good humored unexpected elderly 
laugh laugh stop cried natásha shaking the whole bed awfully like me just such another 
giggler wait and she seized the hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger 
saying and continued kissing august on the other hand mamma is he very much in 
love what do you think was anybody ever so much in love with you and 
very nice very very nice only not quite my is so narrow like the dining 
room clock you understand narrow you light gray rubbish talking said the countess natásha continued 
you really understand nicholas would understand bezúkhov now is blue dark blue and red and 
he is square flirt with him too said the countess laughing he is a freemason 
i have found out he is fine dark blue and red how can i explain 
it to you countess the voice called from behind the door not asleep natásha jumped 
up snatched up her slippers and ran barefoot to her own room it was a 
long time before she could sleep she kept thinking that no one could understand all 
that she understood and all there was in her she thought glancing at that curled 
up sleeping little kitten with her enormous plait of hair how could she virtuous she 
fell in love with nicholas and does not wish to know anything more even mamma 
does not understand it is wonderful how clever i am and how charming she is 
she went on speaking of herself in the third person and imagining it was some 
very wise wisest and best of was saying it of her is everything everything in 
her continued this man is unusually intelligent charming and then she is pretty uncommonly pretty 
and swims and rides splendidly and her voice one can really say a wonderful voice 
she hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by cherubini threw herself on her bed 
laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately fall asleep called dunyásha the maid 
to put out the candle and before dunyásha had left the room had already passed 
into yet another happier world of dreams where everything was as light and beautiful as 
in reality and even more so because it was different next day the countess called 
borís aside and had a talk with him after which he ceased coming to the 
chapter xiv on the thirty first of december new eve 1809 10 an old grandee 
of day was giving a ball and midnight supper the diplomatic corps and the emperor 
himself were to be present the well known mansion on the english quay glittered with 
innumerable lights police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance which was carpeted with red 
baize and not only gendarmes but dozens of police officers and even the police master 
himself stood at the porch carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving with red 
liveried footmen and footmen in plumed hats from the carriages emerged men wearing uniforms stars 
and ribbons while ladies in satin and ermine cautiously descended the carriage steps which were 
let down for them with a clatter and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the 
baize at the entrance almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran 
through the crowd and caps were doffed emperor no a minister prince ambassador you see 
the plumes was whispered among the crowd one person better dressed than the rest seemed 
to know everyone and mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day a third 
of the visitors had already arrived but the rostóvs who were to be present were 
still hurrying to get dressed there had been many discussions and preparations for this ball 
in the rostóv family many fears that the invitation would not arrive that the dresses 
would not be ready or that something would not be arranged as it should be 
márya ignátevna perónskaya a thin and shallow maid of honor at the court of the 
dowager empress who was a friend and relation of the countess and piloted the provincial 
rostóvs in petersburg high society was to accompany them to the ball they were to 
call for her at her house in the taurida gardens at ten but it was 
already five minutes to ten and the girls were not yet dressed natásha was going 
to her first grand ball she had got up at eight that morning and had 
been in a fever of excitement and activity all day all her powers since morning 
had been concentrated on ensuring that they herself mamma and be as well dressed as 
possible sónya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands the countess was to 
wear a claret colored velvet dress and the two girls white gauze over pink silk 
slips with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed à la grecque everything essential 
had already been done feet hands necks and ears washed perfumed and powdered as befits 
a ball the openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on 
the hairdressing was almost done sónya was finishing dressing and so was the countess but 
natásha who had bustled about helping them all was behindhand she was still sitting before 
a looking glass with a dressing jacket thrown over her slender shoulders sónya stood ready 
dressed in the middle of the room and pressing the head of a pin till 
it hurt her dainty finger was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the 
pin went through it not the way not the way sónya cried natásha turning her 
head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the maid who was dressing 
it had not time to release bow is not right come here sónya sat down 
and natásha pinned the ribbon on differently me miss i do it like that said 
the maid who was holding hair dear well then wait right sónya you ready it 
is nearly ten came the voice directly and you mamma have only my cap to 
pin on do it without me called natásha do it right already ten they had 
decided to be at the ball by half past ten and natásha had still to 
get dressed and they had to call at the taurida gardens when her hair was 
done natásha in her short petticoat from under which her dancing shoes showed and in 
her dressing jacket ran up to sónya scrutinized her and then ran to her mother 
turning her head this way and that she fastened on the cap and hurriedly kissing 
her gray hair ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of 
her skirt the cause of the delay was skirt which was too long two maids 
were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of thread a third 
with pins in her mouth was running about between the countess and sónya and a 
fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment up high on one uplifted hand quicker 
darling me my thimble miss from there will you be ready asked the count coming 
to the door is some scent perónskaya must be tired of waiting ready miss said 
the maid holding up the shortened gauze dress with two fingers and blowing and shaking 
something off it as if by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and 
purity of what she held natásha began putting on the dress a minute in a 
minute come in papa she cried to her father as he opened the from under 
the filmy skirt which still covered her whole face sónya slammed the door to a 
minute later they let the count in he was wearing a blue swallow tail coat 
shoes and stockings and was perfumed and his hair pomaded papa how nice you look 
charming cried natásha as she stood in the middle of the room smoothing out the 
folds of the gauze you please miss allow me said the maid who on her 
knees was pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her 
mouth to the other with her tongue what you like exclaimed sónya in a despairing 
voice as she looked at natásha what you like still too long natásha stepped back 
to look at herself in the pier glass the dress was too long madam it 
is not at all too long said mávra crawling on her knees after her young 
lady if too long tack it up tack it up in one minute said the 
resolute dunyásha taking a needle that was stuck on the front of her little shawl 
and still kneeling on the floor set to work once more at that moment with 
soft steps the countess came in shyly in her cap and velvet gown oo my 
beauty exclaimed the count looks better than any of you he would have embraced her 
but blushing she stepped aside fearing to be rumpled your cap more to this side 
said natásha arrange it and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking 
up her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn 
off goodness what has happened really it was not my fault mind run it up 
it show said dunyásha a very queen said the nurse as she came to the 
door sónya they are lovely at a quarter past ten they at last got into 
their carriages and started but they had still to call at the taurida gardens perónskaya 
was quite ready in spite of her age and plainness she had gone through the 
same process as the rostóvs but with less to her it was a matter of 
routine her ugly old body was washed perfumed and powdered in just the same way 
she had washed behind her ears just as carefully and when she entered her drawing 
room in her yellow dress wearing her badge as maid of honor her old maid 
was as full of rapturous admiration as the servants had been she praised the toilets 
they praised her taste and toilet and at eleven careful of their coiffures and dresses 
they settled themselves in their carriages and drove off chapter xv natásha had not had 
a moment free since early morning and had not once had time to think of 
what lay before her in the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying 
carriage she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there 
at the ball in those brightly lighted music flowers dances the emperor and all the 
brilliant young people of petersburg the prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it 
would come true so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness 
of the carriage she understood all that awaited her only when after stepping over the 
red baize at the entrance she entered the hall took off her fur cloak and 
beside sónya and in front of her mother mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between the 
flowers only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball and tried 
to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion 
but fortunately for her she felt her eyes growing misty she saw nothing clearly her 
pulse beat a hundred to the minute and the blood throbbed at her heart she 
could not assume that pose which would have made her ridiculous and she moved on 
almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might to conceal it and this 
was the very attitude that became her best before and behind them other visitors were 
entering also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses the mirrors on the landing 
reflected ladies in white pale blue and pink dresses with diamonds and pearls on their 
bare necks and arms natásha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection 
from the others all was blended into one brilliant procession on entering the ballroom the 
regular hum of voices footsteps and greetings deafened natásha and the light and glitter dazzled 
her still more the host and hostess who had already been standing at the door 
for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals de vous voir 
greeted the rostóvs and perónskaya in the same manner to see you the two girls 
in their white dresses each with a rose in her black hair both curtsied in 
the same way but the eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim natásha she looked 
at her and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile 
as hostess looking at her she may have recalled the golden irrecoverable days of her 
own girlhood and her own first ball the host also followed natásha with his eyes 
and asked the count which was his daughter said he kissing the tips of his 
fingers in the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the emperor the 
countess took up a position in one of the front rows of that crowd natásha 
heard and felt that several people were asking about her and looking at her she 
realized that those noticing her liked her and this observation helped to calm her are 
some like ourselves and some worse she thought perónskaya was pointing out to the countess 
the most important people at the ball is the dutch ambassador do you see that 
gray haired man she said indicating an old man with a profusion of silver gray 
curly hair who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said here she is 
the queen of petersburg countess bezúkhova said perónskaya indicating hélène who had just entered lovely 
she is quite equal to márya antónovna see how the men young and old pay 
court to her beautiful and clever they say prince is quite mad about her but 
see those two though not good looking are even more run after she pointed to 
a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain daughter is a 
splendid match a millionairess said perónskaya look here come her suitors is brother anatole kurágin 
she said indicating a handsome officer of the horse guards who passed by them with 
head erect looking at something over the heads of the ladies handsome he i hear 
they will marry him to that rich girl but your cousin drubetskóy is also very 
attentive to her they say she has millions oh yes the french ambassador himself she 
replied to the inquiry about caulaincourt as if he were a king all the same 
the french are charming very charming no one more charming in society ah here she 
is yes she is still the most beautiful of them all our márya antónovna and 
how simply she is dressed lovely and that stout one in spectacles is the universal 
freemason she went on indicating pierre him beside his wife and he looks a regular 
buffoon pierre swaying his stout body advanced making way through the crowd and nodding to 
right and left as casually and good naturedly as if he were passing through a 
crowd at a fair he pushed through evidently looking for someone natásha looked joyfully at 
the familiar face of pierre buffoon as perónskaya had called him and knew he was 
looking for them and for her in particular he had promised to be at the 
ball and introduce partners to her but before he reached them pierre stopped beside a 
very handsome dark man of middle height and in a white uniform who stood by 
a window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon natásha at once 
recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform it was bolkónski who seemed 
to her to have grown much younger happier and better looking someone else we do 
you see mamma said natásha pointing out prince andrew remember he stayed a night with 
us at otrádnoe you know him said perónskaya bear him il fait à présent la 
pluie et le beau temps too proud for anything takes after his father and hand 
in glove with speránski writing some project or other just look how he treats the 
ladies one talking to him and he has turned away she said pointing at him 
give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies is all 
the rage just now chapter xvi suddenly everybody stirred began talking and pressed forward and 
then back and between the two rows which separated the emperor entered to the sounds 
of music that had immediately struck up behind him walked his host and hostess he 
walked in rapidly bowing to right and left as if anxious to get the first 
moments of the reception over the band played the polonaise in vogue at that time 
on account of the words that had been set to it beginning elisaveta all our 
hearts you ravish quite the emperor passed on to the drawing room the crowd made 
a rush for the doors and several persons with excited faces hurried there and back 
again then the crowd hastily retired from the drawing room door at which the emperor 
reappeared talking to the hostess a young man looking distraught pounced down on the ladies 
asking them to move aside some ladies with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the 
rules of decorum pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets the men began to 
choose partners and take their places for the polonaise everyone moved back and the emperor 
came smiling out of the drawing room leading his hostess by the hand but not 
keeping time to the music the host followed with márya antónovna narýshkina then came ambassadors 
ministers and various generals whom perónskaya diligently named more than half the ladies already had 
partners and were taking up or preparing to take up their positions for the polonaise 
natásha felt that she would be left with her mother and sónya among a minority 
of women who crowded near the wall not having been invited to dance she stood 
with her slender arms hanging down her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly and 
with bated breath and glittering frightened eyes gazed straight before her evidently prepared for the 
height of joy or misery she was not concerned about the emperor or any of 
those great people whom perónskaya was pointing had but one thought it possible no one 
will ask me that i shall not be among the first to dance is it 
possible that not one of all these men will notice me they do not even 
seem to see me or if they do they look as if they were saying 
not the one after so not worth looking at her no impossible she thought must 
know how i long to dance how splendidly i dance and how they would enjoy 
dancing with me the strains of the polonaise which had continued for a considerable time 
had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to ears she wanted to cry perónskaya 
had left them the count was at the other end of the room she and 
the countess and sónya were standing by themselves as in the depths of a forest 
amid that crowd of strangers with no one interested in them and not wanted by 
anyone prince andrew with a lady passed by evidently not recognizing them the handsome anatole 
was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at natásha as one 
looks at a wall borís passed them twice and each time turned away berg and 
his wife who were not dancing came up to them this family gathering seemed humiliating 
to if there were nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the 
ball she did not listen to or look at véra who was telling her something 
about her own green dress at last the emperor stopped beside his last partner he 
had danced with three and the music ceased a worried aide de camp ran up 
to the rostóvs requesting them to stand farther back though as it was they were 
already close to the wall and from the gallery resounded the distinct precise enticingly rhythmical 
strains of a waltz the emperor looked smilingly down the room a minute passed but 
no one had yet begun dancing an aide de camp the master of ceremonies went 
up to countess bezúkhova and asked her to dance she smilingly raised her hand and 
laid it on his shoulder without looking at him the aide de camp an adept 
in his art grasping his partner firmly round her waist with confident deliberation started smoothly 
gliding first round the edge of the circle then at the corner of the room 
he caught left hand and turned her the only sound audible apart from the ever 
quickening music being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid agile feet while 
at every third beat his velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she 
whirled round natásha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not 
she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz prince andrew in the white 
uniform of a cavalry colonel wearing stockings and dancing shoes stood looking animated and bright 
in the front row of the circle not far from the rostóvs baron firhoff was 
talking to him about the first sitting of the council of state to be held 
next day prince andrew as one closely connected with speránski and participating in the work 
of the legislative commission could give reliable information about that sitting concerning which various rumors 
were current but not listening to what firhoff was saying he was gazing now at 
the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who had not yet gathered 
courage to enter the circle prince andrew was watching these men abashed by the presence 
and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance pierre came up 
to him and caught him by the arm always dance i have a protégée the 
young rostóva here ask her he said is she asked bolkónski me he added turning 
to the baron will finish this conversation a ball one must dance he stepped forward 
in the direction pierre indicated the despairing dejected expression of face caught his eye he 
recognized her guessed her feelings saw that it was her début remembered her conversation at 
the window and with an expression of pleasure on his face approached countess rostóva me 
to introduce you to my daughter said the countess with heightened color have the pleasure 
of being already acquainted if the countess remembers me said prince andrew with a low 
and courteous bow quite belying remarks about his rudeness and approaching natásha he held out 
his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his invitation he asked her 
to waltz that tremulous expression on face prepared either for despair or rapture suddenly brightened 
into a happy grateful childlike smile have long been waiting for you that frightened happy 
little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as she 
raised her hand to prince shoulder they were the second couple to enter the circle 
prince andrew was one of the best dancers of his day and natásha danced exquisitely 
her little feet in their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly lightly and 
independently of herself while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness her slender bare arms and 
neck were not to her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped but hélène seemed 
as it were hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had 
scanned her person while natásha was like a girl exposed for the first time who 
would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this was absolutely 
necessary prince andrew liked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly as possible from the 
political and clever talk which everyone addressed to him wishing also to break up the 
circle of restraint he disliked caused by the presence he danced and had chosen natásha 
because pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first pretty girl 
who caught his eye but scarcely had he embraced that slender supple figure and felt 
her stirring so close to him and smiling so near him than the wine of 
her charm rose to his head and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after 
leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers chapter xvii after prince 
andrew borís came up to ask natásha for a dance and then the aide de 
camp who had opened the ball and several other young men so that flushed and 
happy and passing on her superfluous partners to sónya she did not cease dancing all 
the evening she noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else not only did 
she fail to notice that the emperor talked a long time with the french ambassador 
and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady or that prince so and 
so and so and so did and said this and that and that hélène had 
great success and was honored by the special attention of so and so but she 
did not even see the emperor and only noticed that he had gone because the 
ball became livelier after his departure for one of the merry cotillions before supper prince 
andrew was again her partner he reminded her of their first encounter in the otrádnoe 
avenue and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night and told her 
how he had involuntarily overheard her natásha blushed at that recollection and tried to excuse 
herself as if there had been something to be ashamed of in what prince andrew 
had overheard like all men who have grown up in society prince andrew liked meeting 
someone there not of the conventional society stamp and such was natásha with her surprise 
her delight her shyness and even her mistakes in speaking french with her he behaved 
with special care and tenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most 
unimportant matters he admired her shy grace in the middle of the cotillion having completed 
one of the figures natásha still out of breath was returning to her seat when 
another dancer chose her she was tired and panting and evidently thought of declining but 
immediately put her hand gaily on the shoulder smiling at prince andrew be glad to 
sit beside you and rest tired but you see how they keep asking me and 
glad of it happy and i love everybody and you and i understand it all 
and much much more was said in her smile when her partner left her natásha 
ran across the room to choose two ladies for the figure she goes to her 
cousin first and then to another lady she will be my wife said prince andrew 
to himself quite to his own surprise as he watched her she did go first 
to her cousin rubbish sometimes enters head thought prince andrew what is certain is that 
that girl is so charming so original that she be dancing here a month before 
she will be married such as she are rare here he thought as natásha readjusting 
a rose that was slipping on her bodice settled herself beside him when the cotillion 
was over the old count in his blue coat came up to the dancers he 
invited prince andrew to come and see them and asked his daughter whether she was 
enjoying herself natásha did not answer at once but only looked up with a smile 
that said reproachfully can you ask such a question have never enjoyed myself so much 
before she said and prince andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if 
to embrace her father and instantly dropped again natásha was happier than she had ever 
been in her life she was at that height of bliss when one becomes completely 
kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of evil unhappiness or sorrow 
at that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position his wife 
occupied in court circles he was gloomy and absent minded a deep furrow ran across 
his forehead and standing by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one 
on her way to supper natásha passed him gloomy unhappy look struck her she stopped 
in front of him she wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance 
of her own happiness delightful it is count said she it pierre smiled absent mindedly 
evidently not grasping what she said i am very glad he said can people be 
dissatisfied with anything thought natásha such a capital fellow as bezúkhov in eyes all the 
people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid people loving one another none 
of them capable of injuring so they ought all to be happy chapter xviii next 
day prince andrew thought of the ball but his mind did not dwell on it 
long it was a very brilliant ball and then that little rostóva is very charming 
something fresh original un petersburg like about her that distinguishes her that was all he 
thought about ball and after his morning tea he set to work but either from 
fatigue or want of sleep he was ill disposed for work and could get nothing 
done he kept criticizing his own work as he often did and was glad when 
he heard someone coming the visitor was bítski who served on various committees frequented all 
the societies in petersburg and was a passionate devotee of the new ideas and of 
speránski and a diligent petersburg of those men who choose their opinions like their clothes 
according to the fashion but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest 
partisans hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into prince room 
with a preoccupied air and at once began talking he had just heard particulars of 
that sitting of the council of state opened by the emperor and he spoke of 
it enthusiastically the speech had been extraordinary it had been a speech such as only 
constitutional monarchs deliver sovereign plainly said that the council and senate are estates of the 
realm he said that the government must rest not on authority but on secure bases 
the emperor said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts published recounted 
bítski emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly yes events mark an epoch the 
greatest epoch in our history he concluded prince andrew listened to the account of the 
opening of the council of state which he had so impatiently awaited and to which 
he had attached such importance and was surprised that this event now that it had 
taken place did not affect him and even seemed quite insignificant he listened with quiet 
irony to enthusiastic account of it a very simple thought occurred to him does it 
matter to me or to bítski what the emperor was pleased to say at the 
council can all that make me any happier or better and this simple reflection suddenly 
destroyed all the interest prince andrew had felt in the impending reforms he was going 
to dine that evening at only a few friends as the host had said when 
inviting him the prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle of the man 
he so admired had greatly interested prince andrew especially as he had not yet seen 
speránski in his domestic surroundings but now he felt disinclined to go to it at 
the appointed hour however he entered the modest house speránski owned in the taurida gardens 
in the parqueted dining room of this small house remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting 
that of a monastery prince andrew who was rather late found the friendly gathering of 
intimate acquaintances already assembled at five there were no ladies present except little daughter long 
faced like her father and her governess the other guests were gervais magnítski and stolýpin 
while still in the anteroom prince andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh 
such as one hears on the stage sounded like distinctly ejaculating ha ha ha prince 
andrew had never before heard famous laugh and this ringing high pitched laughter from a 
statesman made a strange impression on him he entered the dining room the whole company 
were standing between two windows at a small table laid with hors speránski wearing a 
gray swallow tail coat with a star on the breast and evidently still the same 
waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of the council of 
state stood at the table with a beaming countenance his guests surrounded him magnítski addressing 
himself to speránski was relating an anecdote and speránski was laughing in advance at what 
magnítski was going to say when prince andrew entered the room words were again crowned 
by laughter stolýpin gave a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread 
and cheese gervais laughed softly with a hissing chuckle and speránski in a high pitched 
staccato manner still laughing speránski held out his soft white hand to prince andrew pleased 
to see you prince he said moment he went on turning to magnítski and interrupting 
his story have agreed that this is a dinner for recreation with not a word 
about business and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh prince andrew 
looked at the laughing speránski with astonishment regret and disillusionment it seemed to him that 
this was not speránski but someone else everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and fascinating 
in speránski suddenly became plain and unattractive at dinner the conversation did not cease for 
a moment and seemed to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes 
before magnítski had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something still funnier 
most of the anecdotes if not relating to the state service related to people in 
the service it seemed that in this company the insignificance of those people was so 
definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored ridicule 
speránski related how at the council that morning a deaf dignitary when asked his opinion 
replied that he thought so too gervais gave a long account of an official revision 
remarkable for the stupidity of everybody concerned stolýpin stuttering broke into the conversation and began 
excitedly talking of the abuses that existed under the former order of to give a 
serious turn to the conversation magnítski starting quizzing stolýpin about his vehemence gervais intervened with 
a joke and the talk reverted to its former lively tone evidently speránski liked to 
rest after his labors and find amusement in a circle of friends and his guests 
understanding his wish tried to enliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety seemed to 
prince andrew mirthless and tiresome high pitched voice struck him unpleasantly and the incessant laughter 
grated on him like a false note prince andrew did not laugh and feared that 
he would be a damper on the spirits of the company but no one took 
any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood they all seemed 
very gay he tried several times to join in the conversation but his remarks were 
tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water and he could 
not jest with them there was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it 
was witty and might have been funny but it lacked just that something which is 
the salt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existed 
after dinner daughter and her governess rose he patted the little girl with his white 
hand and kissed her and that gesture too seemed unnatural to prince andrew the men 
remained at table over their fashion in the midst of a conversation that was started 
about spanish affairs which they all agreed in approving prince andrew began to express a 
contrary opinion speránski smiled and with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking 
an unpleasant course told a story that had no connection with the previous conversation for 
a few moments all were silent having sat some time at table speránski corked a 
bottle of wine and remarking good wine rides in a carriage and pair passed it 
to the servant and got up all rose and continuing to talk loudly went into 
the drawing room two letters brought by a courier were handed to speránski and he 
took them to his study as soon as he had left the room the general 
merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly and quietly with one another for 
the recitation said speránski on returning from his study wonderful talent he said to prince 
andrew and magnítski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in french 
which he had composed about various well known petersburg people he was interrupted several times 
by applause when the verses were finished prince andrew went up to speránski and took 
his leave are you off to so early asked speránski promised to go to a 
reception they said no more prince andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike impenetrable eyes and 
felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have expected anything from speránski and 
from any of his own activities connected with him or ever to have attributed importance 
to what speránski was doing that precise mirthless laughter rang in prince ears long after 
he had left the house when he reached home prince andrew began thinking of his 
life in petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new he 
recalled his exertions and solicitations and the history of his project of army reform which 
had been accepted for consideration and which they were trying to pass over in silence 
simply because another a very poor one had already been prepared and submitted to the 
emperor he thought of the meetings of a committee of which berg was a member 
he remembered how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and procedure was 
discussed at those meetings and how sedulously and promptly all that related to the gist 
of the business was evaded he recalled his labors on the legal code and how 
painstakingly he had translated the articles of the roman and french codes into russian and 
he felt ashamed of himself then he vividly pictured to himself boguchárovo his occupations in 
the country his journey to ryazán he remembered the peasants and dron the village elder 
and mentally applying to them the personal rights he had divided into paragraphs he felt 
astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless work chapter xix 
next day prince andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before and 
among them at the with whom he had renewed acquaintance at the ball apart from 
considerations of politeness which demanded the call he wanted to see that original eager girl 
who had left such a pleasant impression on his mind in her own home natásha 
was one of the first to meet him she was wearing a dark blue house 
dress in which prince andrew thought her even prettier than in her ball dress she 
and all the rostóv family welcomed him as an old friend simply and cordially the 
whole family whom he had formerly judged severely now seemed to him to consist of 
excellent simple and kindly people the old hospitality and good nature which struck one especially 
in petersburg as a pleasant surprise were such that prince andrew could not refuse to 
stay to dinner he thought are capital people who of course have not the slightest 
idea what a treasure they possess in natásha but they are kindly folk and form 
the best possible setting for this strikingly poetic charming girl overflowing with life in natásha 
prince andrew was conscious of a strange world completely alien to him and brimful of 
joys unknown to him a different world that in the otrádnoe avenue and at the 
window that moonlight night had already begun to disconcert him now this world disconcerted him 
no longer and was no longer alien to him but he himself having entered it 
found in it a new enjoyment after dinner natásha at prince request went to the 
clavichord and began singing prince andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies and 
listened to her in the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and suddenly felt 
tears choking him a thing he had thought impossible for him he looked at natásha 
as she sang and something new and joyful stirred in his soul he felt happy 
and at the same time sad he had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he 
was ready to weep what about his former love the little princess his disillusionments his 
hopes for the future yes and no the chief reason was a sudden vivid sense 
of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and illimitable within him and that limited 
and material something that he and even she was this contrast weighed on and yet 
cheered him while she sang as soon as natásha had finished she went up to 
him and asked how he liked her voice she asked this and then became confused 
feeling that she ought not to have asked it he smiled looking at her and 
said he liked her singing as he liked everything she did prince andrew left the 
late in the evening he went to bed from habit but soon realized that he 
could not sleep having lit his candle he sat up in bed then got up 
then lay down again not at all troubled by his sleeplessness his soul was as 
fresh and joyful as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into own 
fresh air it did not enter his head that he was in love with natásha 
he was not thinking about her but only picturing her to himself and in consequence 
all life appeared in a new light do i strive why do i toil in 
this narrow confined frame when life all life with all its joys is open to 
me said he to himself and for the first time for a very long while 
he began making happy plans for the future he decided that he must attend to 
his education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his charge then he 
ought to retire from the service and go abroad and see england switzerland and italy 
must use my freedom while i feel so much strength and youth in me he 
said to himself was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of 
happiness in order to be happy and now i do believe in it let the 
dead bury their dead but while one has life one must live and be happy 
thought he chapter xx one morning colonel berg whom pierre knew as he knew everybody 
in moscow and petersburg came to see him berg arrived in an immaculate brand new 
uniform with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his temples as the emperor alexander 
wore his hair have just been to see the countess your wife unfortunately she could 
not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more fortunate with you 
he said with a smile is it you wish colonel i am at your service 
have now quite settled in my new rooms berg said this with perfect conviction that 
this information could not but be agreeable so i wish to arrange just a small 
party for my own and my friends he smiled still more pleasantly wished to ask 
the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to 
supper only countess hélène considering the society of such people as the bergs beneath her 
could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation berg explained so clearly why he 
wanted to collect at his house a small but select company and why this would 
give him pleasure and why though he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful 
he was prepared to run into some expense for the sake of good pierre could 
not refuse and promised to come be late count if i may venture to ask 
about ten minutes to eight please we shall make up a rubber our general is 
coming he is very good to me we shall have supper count so you will 
do me the favor contrary to his habit of being late pierre on that day 
arrived at the house not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight having prepared 
everything necessary for the party the bergs were ready for their arrival in their new 
clean and light study with its small busts and pictures and new furniture sat berg 
and his wife berg closely buttoned up in his new uniform sat beside his wife 
explaining to her that one always could and should be acquainted with people above one 
because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances can get to know something you 
can ask for something see how i managed from my first promotion berg measured his 
life not by years but by promotions comrades are still nobodies while i am only 
waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment and have the happiness to be your 
husband he rose and kissed hand and on the way to her straightened out a 
turned up corner of the carpet how have i obtained all this chiefly by knowing 
how to choose my aquaintances it goes without saying that one must be conscientious and 
methodical berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman and paused 
reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak woman who 
could not understand all that constitutes a dignity what it was ein mann zu sein 
véra at the same time smiling with a sense of superiority over her good conscientious 
husband who all the same understood life wrongly as according to véra all men did 
berg judging by his wife thought all women weak and foolish véra judging only by 
her husband and generalizing from that observation supposed that all men though they understand nothing 
and are conceited and selfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone to be a man 
berg rose and embraced his wife carefully so as not to crush her lace fichu 
for which he had paid a good price kissing her straight on the lips only 
thing is we have children too soon he continued following an unconscious sequence of ideas 
answered véra at all want that we must live for society yusúpova wore one exactly 
like this said berg pointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile just 
then count bezúkhov was announced husband and wife glanced at one another both smiling with 
self satisfaction and each mentally claiming the honor of this visit is what comes of 
knowing how to make acquaintances thought berg is what comes of knowing how to conduct 
oneself please interrupt me when i am entertaining the guests said véra i know what 
interests each of them and what to say to different people berg smiled again be 
helped men must sometimes have masculine conversation said he they received pierre in their small 
new drawing room where it was impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry 
neatness and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that berg having generously 
offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair or of the sofa for his dear 
guest but being apparently painfully undecided on the matter himself eventually left the visitor to 
settle the question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself 
and berg and véra immediately began their evening party interrupting each other in their efforts 
to entertain their guest véra having decided in her own mind that pierre ought to 
be entertained with conversation about the french embassy at once began accordingly berg having decided 
that masculine conversation was required interrupted his remarks and touched on the question of the 
war with austria and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal considerations as to 
the proposals made him to take part in the austrian campaign and the reasons why 
he had declined them though the conversation was very incoherent and véra was angry at 
the intrusion of the masculine element both husband and wife felt with satisfaction that even 
if only one guest was present their evening had begun very well and was as 
like as two peas to every other evening party with its talk tea and lighted 
candles before long borís old comrade arrived there was a shade of condescension and patronage 
in his treatment of berg and véra after borís came a lady with the colonel 
then the general himself then the rostóvs and the party became unquestionably exactly like all 
other evening parties berg and véra could not repress their smiles of satisfaction at the 
sight of all this movement in their drawing room at the sound of the disconnected 
talk the rustling of dresses and the bowing and scraping everything was just as everybody 
always has it especially so the general who admired the apartment patted berg on the 
shoulder and with parental authority superintended the setting out of the table for boston the 
general sat down by count ilyá rostóv who was next to himself the most important 
guest the old people sat with the old the young with the young and the 
hostess at the tea table on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in 
a silver cake basket as the panins had at their party everything was just as 
it was everywhere else chapter xxi pierre as one of the principal guests had to 
sit down to boston with count rostóv the general and the colonel at the card 
table he happened to be directly facing natásha and was struck by a curious change 
that had come over her since the ball she was silent and not only less 
pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness by her look of gentle 
indifference to everything around the matter with her thought pierre glancing at her she was 
sitting by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without looking at him made 
some reply to borís who sat down beside her after playing out a whole suit 
and to his delight taking five tricks pierre hearing greetings and the steps of someone 
who had entered the room while he was picking up his tricks glanced again at 
natásha has happened to her he asked himself with still greater surprise prince andrew was 
standing before her saying something to her with a look of tender solicitude she having 
raised her head was looking up at him flushed and evidently trying to master her 
rapid breathing and the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was 
again alight in her she was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again 
become what she had been at the ball prince andrew went up to pierre and 
the latter noticed a new and youthful expression in his face pierre changed places several 
times during the game sitting now with his back to natásha and now facing her 
but during the whole of the six rubbers he watched her and his friend very 
important is happening between them thought pierre and a feeling that was both joyful and 
painful agitated him and made him neglect the game after six rubbers the general got 
up saying that it was no use playing like that and pierre was released natásha 
on one side was talking with sónya and borís and véra with a subtle smile 
was saying something to prince andrew pierre went up to his friend and asking whether 
they were talking secrets sat down beside them véra having noticed prince attentions to natásha 
decided that at a party a real evening party subtle allusions to the tender passion 
were absolutely necessary and seizing a moment when prince andrew was alone began a conversation 
with him about feelings in general and about her sister with so intellectual a guest 
as she considered prince andrew to be she felt that she had to employ her 
diplomatic tact when pierre went up to them he noticed that véra was being carried 
away by her self satisfied talk but that prince andrew seemed embarrassed a thing that 
rarely happened with him do you think véra was saying with an arch smile are 
so discerning prince and understand characters so well at a glance what do you think 
of natalie could she be constant in her attachments could she like other véra meant 
herself a man once for all and remain true to him forever that is what 
i consider true love what do you think prince know your sister too little replied 
prince andrew with a sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment be 
able to solve so delicate a question and then i have noticed that the less 
attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be he added and 
looked up at pierre who was just approaching them that is true prince in our 
days continued as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing imagining that they have 
discovered and appraised the peculiarities of and that human characteristics change with the our days 
a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often stifles real 
feeling in her and it must be confessed that natalie is very susceptible this return 
to the subject of natalie caused prince andrew to knit his brows with discomfort he 
was about to rise but véra continued with a still more subtle smile think no 
one has been more courted than she she went on till quite lately she never 
cared seriously for anyone now you know count she said to pierre our dear cousin 
borís who between ourselves was very far gone in the land of tenderness alluding to 
a map of love much in vogue at that time prince andrew frowned and remained 
silent are friendly with borís you asked véra i know him expect he has told 
you of his childish love for natásha there was childish love suddenly asked prince andrew 
blushing unexpectedly you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love le cousinage est un 
dangereux voisinage you think so is a dangerous neighborhood undoubtedly said prince andrew and with 
sudden and unnatural liveliness he began chaffing pierre about the need to be very careful 
with his fifty year old moscow cousins and in the midst of these jesting remarks 
he rose taking pierre by the arm and drew him aside asked pierre seeing his 
strange animation with surprise and noticing the glance he turned on natásha as he rose 
must i must have a talk with you said prince andrew know that pair of 
gloves he referred to the masonic gloves given to a newly initiated brother to present 
to the woman he loved but no i will talk to you later on and 
with a strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements prince andrew approached 
natásha and sat down beside her pierre saw how prince andrew asked her something and 
how she flushed as she replied but at that moment berg came to pierre and 
began insisting that he should take part in an argument between the general and the 
colonel on the affairs in spain berg was satisfied and happy the smile of pleasure 
never left his face the party was very successful and quite like other parties he 
had seen everything was similar the subtle talk the cards the general raising his voice 
at the card table and the samovar and the tea cakes only one thing was 
lacking that he had always seen at the evening parties he wished to imitate they 
had not yet had a loud conversation among the men and a dispute about something 
important and clever now the general had begun such a discussion and so berg drew 
pierre to it chapter xxii next day having been invited by the count prince andrew 
dined with the rostóvs and spent the rest of the day there everyone in the 
house realized for whose sake prince andrew came and without concealing it he tried to 
be with natásha all day not only in the soul of the frightened yet happy 
and enraptured natásha but in the whole house there was a feeling of awe at 
something important that was bound to happen the countess looked with sad and sternly serious 
eyes at prince andrew when he talked to natásha and timidly started some artificial conversation 
about trifles as soon as he looked her way sónya was afraid to leave natásha 
and afraid of being in the way when she was with them natásha grew pale 
in a panic of expectation when she remained alone with him for a moment prince 
andrew surprised her by his timidity she felt that he wanted to say something to 
her but could not bring himself to do so in the evening when prince andrew 
had left the countess went up to natásha and whispered what for sake ask me 
anything now one talk about that said natásha but all the same that night natásha 
now agitated and now frightened lay a long time in her bed gazing straight before 
her she told her how he had complimented her how he told her he was 
going abroad asked her where they were going to spend the summer and then how 
he had asked her about borís such a such a never happened to me before 
she said i feel afraid in his presence i am always afraid when with him 
what does that mean does it mean that the real thing yes mamma are you 
asleep my love i am frightened myself answered her mother go the same i sleep 
what silliness to sleep mummy mummy such a thing never happened to me before she 
said surprised and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself could we 
ever have thought it seemed to natásha that even at the time she first saw 
prince andrew at otrádnoe she had fallen in love with him it was as if 
she feared this strange unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had then 
chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and of finding him as it 
seemed not indifferent to her it had to happen that he should come specially to 
petersburg while we are here and it had to happen that we should meet at 
that ball it is fate clearly it is fate that everything led up to this 
already then directly i saw him i felt something peculiar else did he say to 
you what are those verses read them said her mother thoughtfully referring to some verses 
prince andrew had written in album one need not be ashamed of his being a 
widower natásha pray to god are made in heaven said her mother mummy how i 
love you how happy i am cried natásha shedding tears of joy and excitement and 
embracing her mother at that very time prince andrew was sitting with pierre and telling 
him of his love for natásha and his firm resolve to make her his wife 
that day countess hélène had a reception at her house the french ambassador was there 
and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late become a frequent visitor 
of hers and many brilliant ladies and gentlemen pierre who had come downstairs walked through 
the rooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied absent minded and morose air since the 
ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression and had made 
desperate efforts to combat it since the intimacy of his wife with the royal prince 
pierre had unexpectedly been made a gentleman of the bedchamber and from that time he 
had begun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts of the 
vanity of all things human came to him oftener than before at the same time 
the feeling he had noticed between his protégée natásha and prince andrew accentuated his gloom 
by the contrast between his own position and his he tried equally to avoid thinking 
about his wife and about natásha and prince andrew and again everything seemed to him 
insignificant in comparison with eternity again the question for what presented itself and he forced 
himself to work day and night at masonic labors hoping to drive away the evil 
spirit that threatened him toward midnight after he had left the apartments he was sitting 
upstairs in a shabby dressing gown copying out the original transaction of the scottish lodge 
of freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy with tobacco smoke when someone 
came in it was prince andrew you said pierre with a preoccupied dissatisfied air i 
you see am hard at it he pointed to his manuscript book with that air 
of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at their work 
prince andrew with a beaming ecstatic expression of renewed life on his face paused in 
front of pierre and not noticing his sad look smiled at him with the egotism 
of joy dear heart said he wanted to tell you about it yesterday and i 
have come to do so today i never experienced anything like it before i am 
in love my friend suddenly pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person 
down on the sofa beside prince andrew natásha rostóva yes said he yes who else 
should it be i should never have believed it but the feeling is stronger than 
i yesterday i tormented myself and suffered but i would not exchange even that torment 
for anything in the world i have not lived till now at last i live 
but i live without her but can she love me i am too old for 
her why you speak i what did i tell you said pierre suddenly rising and 
beginning to pace up and down the room always thought it that girl is such 
a treasure she is a rare girl my dear friend i entreat you philosophize doubt 
marry marry marry and i am sure there will not be a happier man than 
you what of her loves you talk rubbish said prince andrew smiling and looking into 
eyes does i know pierre cried fiercely do listen returned prince andrew holding him by 
the arm you know the condition i am in i must talk about it to 
someone go on go on i am very glad said pierre and his face really 
changed his brow became smooth and he listened gladly to prince andrew prince andrew seemed 
and really was quite a different quite a new man where was his spleen his 
contempt for life his disillusionment pierre was the only person to whom he made up 
his mind to speak openly and to him he told all that was in his 
soul now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future said he could 
not sacrifice his own happiness to his caprice and spoke of how he would either 
make his father consent to this marriage and love her or would do without his 
consent then he marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange 
apart from and independent of himself should not have believed anyone who told me that 
i was capable of such love said prince andrew is not at all the same 
feeling that i knew in the past the whole world is now for me divided 
into two halves one half is she and there all is joy hope light the 
other half is everything where she is not and there is all gloom and darkness 
and gloom reiterated pierre yes i understand that cannot help loving the light it is 
not my fault and i am very happy you understand me i know you are 
glad for my sake yes pierre assented looking at his friend with a touched and 
sad expression in his eyes the brighter prince lot appeared to him the gloomier seemed 
his own chapter xxiii prince andrew needed his consent to his marriage and to obtain 
this he started for the country next day his father received his communication with external 
composure but inward wrath he could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his 
life or introduce anything new into it when his own life was already ending only 
they would let me end my days as i want to thought the old man 
they might do as they please with his son however he employed the diplomacy he 
reserved for important occasions and adopting a quiet tone discussed the whole matter in the 
first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards birth wealth or rank 
secondly prince andrew was no longer as young as he had been and his health 
was poor the old man laid special stress on this while she was very young 
thirdly he had a son whom it would be a pity to entrust to a 
chit of a girl and finally the father said looking ironically at his son beg 
you to put it off for a year go abroad take a cure look out 
as you wanted to for a german tutor for prince nicholas then if your love 
or passion or you still as great marry and my last word on it mind 
the last concluded the prince in a tone which showed that nothing would make him 
alter his decision prince andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings 
or his would not stand a test or that he the old prince himself would 
die before then and he decided to conform to his propose and postpone the wedding 
for a year three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the rostóvs 
prince andrew returned to petersburg next day after her talk with her mother natásha expected 
bolkónski all day but he did not come on the second and third day it 
was the same pierre did not come either and natásha not knowing that prince andrew 
had gone to see his father could not explain his absence to herself three weeks 
passed in this way natásha had no desire to go out anywhere and wandered from 
room to room like a shadow idle and listless she wept secretly at night and 
did not go to her mother in the evenings she blushed continually and was irritable 
it seemed to her that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her 
and pitying her strong as was her inward grief this wound to her vanity intensified 
her misery once she came to her mother tried to say something and suddenly began 
to cry her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why 
it is being punished the countess began to soothe natásha who after first listening to 
her words suddenly interrupted her off mamma i think and want to think about it 
he just came and then left off left off her voice trembled and she again 
nearly cried but recovered and went on quietly i at all want to get married 
and i am afraid of him i have now become quite calm quite calm the 
day after this conversation natásha put on the old dress which she knew had the 
peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the mornings and that day she returned to 
the old way of life which she had abandoned since the ball having finished her 
morning tea she went to the ballroom which she particularly liked for its loud resonance 
and began singing her solfeggio when she had finished her first exercise she stood still 
in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that particularly pleased her 
she listened joyfully as though she had not expected it to the charm of the 
notes reverberating filling the whole empty ballroom and slowly dying away and all at once 
she felt cheerful the good of making so much of it things are nice as 
it is she said to herself and she began walking up and down the room 
not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with each step from the heel 
to the toe she had on a new and favorite pair of shoes and listening 
to the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe as gladly as 
she had to the sounds of her own voice passing a mirror she glanced into 
it me the expression of her face seemed to say as she caught sight of 
herself and very nice too i need nobody a footman wanted to come in to 
clear away something in the room but she would not let him and having closed 
the door behind him continued her walk that morning she had returned to her favorite 
of and delight in herself charming that natásha is she said again speaking as some 
third collective male person a good voice young and in way if only they leave 
her in peace but however much they left her in peace she could not now 
be at peace and immediately felt this in the hall the porch door opened and 
someone asked home and then footsteps were heard natásha was looking at the mirror but 
did not see herself she listened to the sounds in the hall when she saw 
herself her face was pale it was he she knew this for certain though she 
hardly heard his voice through the closed doors pale and agitated natásha ran into the 
drawing room bolkónski has come she said it is awful it is unbearable i want 
to be tormented what am i to do before the countess could answer prince andrew 
entered the room with an agitated and serious face as soon as he saw natásha 
his face brightened he kissed the hand and and sat down beside the sofa is 
long since we had the pleasure began the countess but prince andrew interrupted her by 
answering her intended question obviously in haste to say what he had to have not 
been to see you all this time because i have been at my i had 
to talk over a very important matter with him i only got back last night 
he said glancing at natásha want to have a talk with you countess he added 
after a pause the countess lowered her eyes sighing deeply am at your disposal she 
murmured natásha knew that she ought to go away but was unable to do so 
something gripped her throat and regardless of manners she stared straight at prince andrew with 
wide open eyes once this instant no it be she thought again he glanced at 
her and that glance convinced her that she was not mistaken yes at once that 
very instant her fate would be decided natásha i will call you said the countess 
in a whisper natásha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at prince andrew and at her 
mother and went out have come countess to ask for your hand said prince andrew 
the face flushed hotly but she said nothing offer she began at last sedately he 
remained silent looking into her eyes offer she grew confused agreeable to us and i 
accept your offer i am glad and my husband i hope but it will depend 
on her will speak to her when i have your consent do you give it 
to me said prince andrew replied the countess she held out her hand to him 
and with a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his forehead 
as he stooped to kiss her hand she wished to love him as a son 
but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man am sure 
my husband will consent said the countess your father father to whom i have told 
my plans has made it an express condition of his consent that the wedding is 
not to take place for a year and i wished to tell you of that 
said prince andrew is true that natásha is still young long as that is unavoidable 
said prince andrew with a sigh will send her to you said the countess and 
left the room have mercy upon us she repeated while seeking her daughter sónya said 
that natásha was in her bedroom natásha was sitting on the bed pale and dry 
eyed and was gazing at the icons and whispering something as she rapidly crossed herself 
seeing her mother she jumped up and flew to her mamma well go to him 
he is asking for your hand said the countess coldly it seemed to natásha go 
said the mother sadly and reproachfully with a deep sigh as her daughter ran away 
natásha never remembered how she entered the drawing room when she came in and saw 
him she paused it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me she 
asked herself and immediately answered everything he alone is now dearer to me than everything 
in the world prince andrew came up to her with downcast eyes have loved you 
from the very first moment i saw you may i hope he looked at her 
and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of her face her face said ask 
why doubt what you cannot but know why speak when words cannot express what one 
feels she drew near to him and stopped he took her hand and kissed it 
you love me yes natásha murmured as if in vexation then she sighed loudly and 
catching her breath more and more quickly began to sob is it the matter i 
am so happy she replied smiled through her tears bent over closer to him paused 
for an instant as if asking herself whether she might and then kissed him prince 
andrew held her hands looked into her eyes and did not find in his heart 
his former love for her something in him had suddenly changed there was no longer 
the former poetic and mystic charm of desire but there was pity for her feminine 
and childish weakness fear at her devotion and trustfulness and an oppressive yet joyful sense 
of the duty that now bound him to her forever the present feeling though not 
so bright and poetic as the former was stronger and more serious your mother tell 
you that it cannot be for a year asked prince andrew still looking into her 
eyes it possible that of a girl as everybody called me thought it possible that 
i am now to be the wife and the equal of this strange dear clever 
man whom even my father looks up to can it be true can it be 
true that there can be no more playing with life that now i am grown 
up that on me now lies a responsibility for my every word and deed yes 
but what did he ask me she replied but she had not understood his question 
me he said you are so young and i have already been through so much 
in life i am afraid for you you do not yet know yourself natásha listened 
with concentrated attention trying but failing to take in the meaning of his words as 
this year which delays my happiness will be continued prince andrew will give you time 
to be sure of yourself i ask you to make me happy in a year 
but you are free our engagement shall remain a secret and should you find that 
you do not love me or should you come to love said prince andrew with 
an unnatural smile do you say that natásha interrupted him know that from the very 
day you first came to otrádnoe i have loved you she cried quite convinced that 
she spoke the truth a year you will learn to know yourself whole year natásha 
repeated suddenly only now realizing that the marriage was to be postponed for a year 
why a year why a year prince andrew began to explain to her the reasons 
for this delay natásha did not hear him it be helped she asked prince andrew 
did not reply but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision awful oh 
awful awful natásha suddenly cried and again burst into sobs shall die waiting a year 
impossible awful she looked into her face and saw in it a look of commiseration 
and perplexity no do anything she said suddenly checking her tears am so happy the 
father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple their blessing from 
that day prince andrew began to frequent the as affianced lover chapter xxiv no betrothal 
ceremony took place and engagement to bolkónski was not announced prince andrew insisted on that 
he said that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the 
whole burden of it that he had given his word and bound himself forever but 
that he did not wish to bind natásha and gave her perfect freedom if after 
six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full right 
to reject him naturally neither natásha nor her parents wished to hear of this but 
prince andrew was firm he came every day to the but did not behave to 
natásha as an affianced lover he did not use the familiar thou but said you 
to her and kissed only her hand after their engagement quite different intimate and natural 
relations sprang up between them it was as if they had not known each other 
till now both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yet 
they were nothing to one another they felt themselves now quite different beings then they 
were artificial now natural and sincere at first the family felt some constraint in intercourse 
with prince andrew he seemed a man from another world and for a long time 
natásha trained the family to get used to him proudly assuring them all that he 
only appeared to be different but was really just like all of them and that 
she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be after a 
few days they grew accustomed to him and without restraint in his presence pursued their 
usual way of life in which he took his part he could talk about rural 
economy with the count fashions with the countess and natásha and about albums and fancywork 
with sónya sometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence expressed their wonder 
at how it had all happened and at the evident omens there had been of 
it prince coming to otrádnoe and their coming to petersburg and the likeness between natásha 
and prince andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit and encounter with 
nicholas in 1805 and many other incidents betokening that it had to be in the 
house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always accompanies the presence of a betrothed 
couple often when all sitting together everyone kept silent sometimes the others would get up 
and go away and the couple left alone still remained silent they rarely spoke of 
their future life prince andrew was afraid and ashamed to speak of it natásha shared 
this as she did all his feelings which she constantly divined once she began questioning 
him about his son prince andrew blushed as he often did particularly liked it in 
said that his son would not live with them not asked natásha in a frightened 
tone cannot take him away from his grandfather and besides i should have loved him 
said natásha immediately guessing his thought i know you wish to avoid any pretext for 
finding fault with us sometimes the old count would come up kiss prince andrew and 
ask his advice about education or service the old countess sighed as she looked at 
them sónya was always getting frightened lest she should be in the way and tried 
to find excuses for leaving them alone even when they did not wish it when 
prince andrew spoke he could tell a story very well natásha listened to him with 
pride when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and 
scrutinizingly at her she asked herself in perplexity does he look for in me he 
is trying to discover something by looking at me what if what he seeks in 
me is not there sometimes she fell into one of the mad merry moods characteristic 
of her and then she particularly loved to hear and see how prince andrew laughed 
he seldom laughed but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter and 
after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him natásha would have been completely 
happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified 
her just as the mere thought of it made him turn pale and cold on 
the eve of his departure from petersburg prince andrew brought with him pierre who had 
not been to the once since the ball pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed he was 
talking to the countess and natásha sat down beside a little chess table with sónya 
thereby inviting prince andrew to come too he did so have known bezúkhov a long 
time he asked you like him a dear but very absurd and as usual when 
speaking of pierre she began to tell anecdotes of his absent mindedness some of which 
had even been invented about him you know i have entrusted him with our secret 
i have known him from childhood he has a heart of gold i beg you 
natalie prince andrew said with sudden am going away and heaven knows what may happen 
you may cease to all right i know i am not to say that only 
this then whatever may happen to you when i am not here can happen trouble 
may come prince andrew continued beg you mademoiselle sophie whatever may happen to turn to 
him alone for advice and help he is a most absent minded and absurd fellow 
but he has a heart of gold neither her father nor her mother nor sónya 
nor prince andrew himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act 
on natásha flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day dry eyed 
occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding what awaited her she did not 
even cry when on taking leave he kissed her hand for the last time go 
she said in a tone that made him wonder whether he really ought not to 
stay and which he remembered long afterwards nor did she cry when he was gone 
but for several days she sat in her room dry eyed taking no interest in 
anything and only saying now and then why did he go away but a fortnight 
after his departure to the surprise of those around her she recovered from her mental 
sickness just as suddenly and became her old self again but with a change in 
her moral physiognomy as a child gets up after a long illness with a changed 
expression of face chapter xxv during that year after his departure prince nicholas health and 
temper became much worse he grew still more irritable and it was princess mary who 
generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits of unprovoked anger he seemed carefully to 
seek out her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible 
princess mary had two passions and consequently two nephew little nicholas and these were the 
favorite subjects of the attacks and ridicule whatever was spoken of he would bring round 
to the superstitiousness of old maids or the petting and spoiling of children want to 
make an old maid like yourself a pity prince andrew wants a son and not 
an old maid he would say or turning to mademoiselle bourienne he would ask her 
in princess presence how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about 
them he continually hurt princess feelings and tormented her but it cost her no effort 
to forgive him could he be to blame toward her or could her father whom 
she knew loved her in spite of it all be unjust and what is justice 
the princess never thought of that proud word all the complex laws of man centered 
for her in one clear and simple law of love and self sacrifice taught us 
by him who lovingly suffered for mankind though he himself was god what had she 
to do with the justice or injustice of other people she had to endure and 
love and that she did during the winter prince andrew had come to bald hills 
and had been gay gentle and more affectionate than princess mary had known him for 
a long time past she felt that something had happened to him but he said 
nothing to her about his love before he left he had a long talk with 
his father about something and princess mary noticed that before his departure they were dissatisfied 
with one another soon after prince andrew had gone princess mary wrote to her friend 
julie karágina in petersburg whom she had dreamed as all girls dream of marrying to 
her brother and who was at that time in mourning for her own brother killed 
in turkey sorrow it seems is our common lot my dear tender friend julie your 
loss is so terrible that i can only explain it to myself as a special 
providence of god who loving you wishes to try you and your excellent mother oh 
my friend religion and religion alone will not say comfort save us from despair religion 
alone can explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend why for what 
cause kind and noble beings able to find happiness in merely harming no one but 
necessary to the happiness of called away to god while cruel useless harmful persons or 
such as are a burden to themselves and to others are left living the first 
death i saw and one i shall never of my dear sister in that impression 
on me just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had to die so 
i asked why that angel lise who not only never wronged anyone but in whose 
soul there were never any unkind thoughts had to die and what do you think 
dear friend five years have passed since then and already i with my petty understanding 
begin to see clearly why she had to die and in what way that death 
was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the creator whose every action though 
generally incomprehensible to us is but a manifestation of his infinite love for his creatures 
perhaps i often think she was too angelically innocent to have the strength to perform 
all a duties as a young wife she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have 
been so as a mother as it is not only has she left us and 
particularly prince andrew with the purest regrets and memories but probably she will there receive 
a place i dare not hope for myself but not to speak of her alone 
that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on 
my brother in spite of all our grief then at the moment of our loss 
these thoughts could not occur to me i should then have dismissed them with horror 
but now they are very clear and certain i write all this to you dear 
friend only to convince you of the gospel truth which has become for me a 
principle of life not a single hair of our heads will fall without his will 
and his will is governed only by infinite love for us and so whatever befalls 
us is for our good you ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow 
in spite of my wish to see you i do not think so and do 
not want to do so you will be surprised to hear that the reason for 
this is buonaparte the case is this my health is growing noticeably worse he cannot 
stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable this irritability is as you know chiefly directed 
to political questions he cannot endure the notion that buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms 
with all the sovereigns of europe and particularly with our own the grandson of the 
great catherine as you know i am quite indifferent to politics but from my remarks 
and his talks with michael ivánovich i know all that goes on in the world 
and especially about the honors conferred on buonaparte who only at bald hills in the 
whole world it seems is not accepted as a great man still less as emperor 
of france and my father cannot stand this it seems to me that it is 
chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going 
to moscow for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing 
his views regardless of anybody all the benefit he might derive from a course of 
treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes about buonaparte which would be 
inevitable in any case it will be decided very shortly our family life goes on 
in the old way except for my brother absence he as i wrote you before 
has changed very much of late after his sorrow he only this year quite recovered 
his spirits he has again become as i used to know him when a child 
kind affectionate with that heart of gold to which i know no equal he has 
realized it seems to me that life is not over for him but together with 
this mental change he has grown physically much weaker he has become thinner and more 
nervous i am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad which 
the doctors recommended long ago i hope it will cure him you write that in 
petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active cultivated and capable of 
the young men forgive my vanity as a relation but i never doubted it the 
good he has done to everybody here from his peasants up to the gentry is 
incalculable on his arrival in petersburg he received only his due i always wonder at 
the way rumors fly from petersburg to moscow especially such false ones as that you 
write mean the report of my betrothal to the little rostóva i do not think 
my brother will ever marry again and certainly not her and this is why first 
i know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he has lost the grief 
of that loss has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide 
to give her a successor and our little angel a stepmother secondly because as far 
as i know that girl is not the kind of girl who could please prince 
andrew i do not think he would choose her for a wife and frankly i 
do not wish it but i am running on too long and am at the 
end of my second sheet good by my dear friend may god keep you in 
his holy and mighty care my dear friend mademoiselle bourienne sends you kisses mary chapter 
xxvi in the middle of the summer princess mary received an unexpected letter from prince 
andrew in switzerland in which he gave her strange and surprising news he informed her 
of his engagement to natásha rostóva the whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed 
and tender and confiding affection for his sister he wrote that he had never loved 
as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life 
was he asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his 
resolve when he had last visited bald hills though he had spoken of it to 
his father he had not done so for fear princess mary should ask her father 
to give his consent irritating him and having to bear the brunt of his displeasure 
without attaining her object he wrote matter was not then so definitely settled as it 
is now my father then insisted on a delay of a year and now already 
six months half of that period have passed and my resolution is firmer than ever 
if the doctors did not keep me here at the spas i should be back 
in russia but as it is i have to postpone my return for three months 
you know me and my relations with father i want nothing from him i have 
been and always shall be independent but to go against his will and arouse his 
anger now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time would destroy 
half my happiness i am now writing to him about the same question and beg 
you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter and to let me 
know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there is hope that he 
may consent to reduce the term by four months after long hesitations doubts and prayers 
princess mary gave the letter to her father the next day the old prince said 
to her quietly and tell your brother to wait till i am dead it be 
shall soon set him free the princess was about to reply but her father would 
not let her speak and raising his voice more and more cried marry my boy 
a good family clever people eh rich eh yes a nice stepmother little nicholas will 
have write and tell him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes she will 
be little stepmother and marry bourienne ha ha ha he be without a stepmother either 
only one thing no more women are wanted in my him marry and live by 
himself perhaps you will go and live with him too he added turning to princess 
mary in name go out into the frost the frost the frost after this outburst 
the prince did not speak any more about the matter but repressed vexation at his 
poor spirited behavior found expression in his treatment of his daughter to his former pretexts 
for irony a fresh one was now to stepmothers and amiabilities to mademoiselle bourienne i 
marry her he asked his daughter make a splendid princess and latterly to her surprise 
and bewilderment princess mary noticed that her father was really associating more and more with 
the frenchwoman she wrote to prince andrew about the reception of his letter but comforted 
him with hopes of reconciling their father to the idea little nicholas and his education 
her brother andrew and religion were princess joys and consolations but besides that since everyone 
must have personal hopes princess mary in the profoundest depths of her heart had a 
hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of her life this comforting dream 
and hope were given her by half witted and other pilgrims who visited her without 
the knowledge the longer she lived the more experience and observation she had of life 
the greater was her wonder at the short sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and 
happiness here on earth toiling suffering struggling and harming one another to obtain that impossible 
visionary sinful happiness prince andrew had loved his wife she died but that was not 
enough he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman her father objected to this 
because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for andrew and they all struggled 
and suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls their eternal souls for the 
attainment of benefits which endure but for an instant not only do we know this 
ourselves but christ the son of god came down to earth and told us that 
this life is but for a moment and is a probation yet we cling to 
it and think to find happiness in it is it that no one realizes this 
thought princess mary one except these despised folk who wallet on back come to me 
by the back door afraid of being seen by the prince not for fear of 
ill usage by him but for fear of causing him to sin to leave family 
home and all the cares of worldly welfare in order without clinging to anything to 
wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name doing no one 
any harm but praying for those who drive one away as well as for those 
who protect one higher than that life and truth there is no life or truth 
there was one pilgrim a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called theodosia who for 
over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn heavy chains princess mary was particularly 
fond of her once when in a room with a lamp dimly lit before the 
icon theodosia was talking of her life the thought that theodosia alone had found the 
true path of life suddenly came to princess mary with such force that she resolved 
to become a pilgrim herself when theodosia had gone to sleep princess mary thought about 
this for a long time and at last made up her mind that strange as 
it might seem she must go on a pilgrimage she disclosed this thought to no 
one but to her confessor father akínfi the monk and he approved of her intention 
under guise of a present for the pilgrims princess mary prepared a complete costume for 
herself a coarse smock bast shoes a rough coat and a black kerchief often approaching 
the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure princess mary paused uncertain whether the time 
had not already come to put her project into execution often listening to the tales 
she was so stimulated by their simple speech mechanical to them but to her so 
full of deep meaning that several times she was on the point of abandoning everything 
and running away from home in imagination she already pictured herself by side dressed in 
coarse rags walking with a staff a wallet on her back along the dusty road 
directing her wanderings from one shrine to another free from envy earthly love or desire 
and reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing but 
eternal joy and bliss shall come to a place and pray there and before having 
time to get used to it or getting to love it i shall go farther 
i will go on till my legs fail and lie down and die somewhere and 
shall at last reach that eternal quiet haven where there is neither sorrow nor sighing 
thought princess mary but afterwards when she saw her father and especially little koko nicholas 
her resolve weakened she wept quietly and felt that she was a sinner who loved 
her father and little nephew more than god book seven 1810 11 chapter i the 
bible legend tells us that the absence of a condition of the first blessedness before 
the fall fallen man has retained a love of idleness but the curse weighs on 
the race not only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of 
our brows but because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle 
and at ease an inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we 
are idle if man could find a state in which he felt that though idle 
he was fulfilling his duty he would have found one of the conditions of primitive 
blessedness and such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a 
whole military the chief attraction of military service has consisted and will consist in this 
compulsory and irreproachable idleness nicholas rostóv experienced this blissful condition to the full when after 
1807 he continued to serve in the pávlograd regiment in which he already commanded the 
squadron he had taken over from denísov rostóv had become a bluff good natured fellow 
whom his moscow acquaintances would have considered rather bad form but who was liked and 
respected by his comrades subordinates and superiors and was well contented with his life of 
late in 1809 he found in letters from home more frequent complaints from his mother 
that their affairs were falling into greater and greater disorder and that it was time 
for him to come back to gladden and comfort his old parents reading these letters 
nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take him away from surroundings in which 
protected from all the entanglements of life he was living so calmly and quietly he 
felt that sooner or later he would have to re enter that whirlpool of life 
with its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out its accounts with stewards quarrels and 
intrigues its ties society and with love and his promise to her it was all 
dreadfully difficult and complicated and he replied to his mother in cold formal letters in 
french beginning dear mamma and ending obedient son which said nothing of when he would 
return in 1810 he received letters from his parents in which they told him of 
engagement to bolkónski and that the wedding would be in a time because the old 
prince made difficulties this letter grieved and mortified nicholas in the first place he was 
sorry that natásha for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family 
should be lost to the home and secondly from his hussar point of view he 
regretted not to have been there to show that fellow bolkónski that connection with him 
was no such great honor after all and that if he loved natásha he might 
dispense with permission from his dotard father for a moment he hesitated whether he should 
not apply for leave in order to see natásha before she was married but then 
came the maneuvers and considerations about sónya and about the confusion of their affairs and 
nicholas again put it off but in the spring of that year he received a 
letter from his mother written without his knowledge and that letter persuaded him to return 
she wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand their whole 
property would be sold by auction and they would all have to go begging the 
count was so weak and trusted mítenka so much and was so good natured that 
everybody took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse sake i 
implore you come at once if you do not wish to make me and the 
whole family wretched wrote the countess this letter touched nicholas he had that common sense 
of a matter of fact man which showed him what he ought to do the 
right thing now was if not to retire from the service at any rate to 
go home on leave why he had to go he did not know but after 
his after dinner nap he gave orders to saddle mars an extremely vicious gray stallion 
that had not been ridden for a long time and when he returned with the 
horse all in a lather he informed lavrúshka servant who had remained with him and 
his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and 
was going home difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he 
would go away without having heard from the this interested him he was promoted to 
a captaincy or would receive the order of st anne for the last maneuvers strange 
as it was to think that he would go away without having sold his three 
roans to the polish count golukhovski who was bargaining for the horses rostóv had betted 
he would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it seemed that the ball the 
hussars were giving in honor of the polish mademoiselle przazdziecka out of rivalry to the 
uhlans who had given one in honor of their polish mademoiselle borzozowska would take place 
without knew he must go away from this good bright world to somewhere where everything 
was stupid and confused a week later he obtained his leave his hussar only those 
of his own regiment but the whole rostóv a dinner to which the subscription was 
fifteen rubles a head and at which there were two bands and two choirs of 
singers rostóv danced the trepák with major básov the tipsy officers tossed embraced and dropped 
rostóv the soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too and shouted and then they 
put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first post station 
during the first half of the kremenchúg to thoughts as is usual in such cases 
were behind him with the squadron but when he had gone more than halfway he 
began to forget his three roans and dozhoyvéyko his quartermaster and to wonder anxiously how 
things would be at otrádnoe and what he would find there thoughts of home grew 
stronger the nearer he approached stronger as though this feeling of his was subject to 
the law by which the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square 
of the distance at the last post station before otrádnoe he gave the driver a 
three ruble tip and on arriving he ran breathlessly like a boy up the steps 
of his home after the rapture of meeting and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied 
feeling that is just the same so why did i hurry began to settle down 
in his old home world his father and mother were much the same only a 
little older what was new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord which 
there used not to be and which as nicholas soon found out was due to 
the bad state of their affairs sónya was nearly twenty she had stopped growing prettier 
and promised nothing more than she was already but that was enough she exhaled happiness 
and love from the time nicholas returned and the faithful unalterable love of this girl 
had a gladdening effect on him pétya and natásha surprised nicholas most pétya was a 
big handsome boy of thirteen merry witty and mischievous with a voice that was already 
breaking as for natásha for a long while nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked 
at her not the same at all he said am i uglier the contrary but 
what dignity a princess he whispered to her yes yes cried natásha joyfully she told 
him about her romance with prince andrew and of his visit to otrádnoe and showed 
him his last letter are you glad natásha asked am so tranquil and happy now 
glad answered nicholas is an excellent fellow and are you very much in love shall 
i put it replied natásha was in love with borís with my teacher and with 
denísov but this is quite different i feel at peace and settled i know that 
no better man than he exists and i am calm and contented now not at 
all as before nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage for a 
year but natásha attacked her brother with exasperation proving to him that it could not 
be otherwise and that it would be a bad thing to enter a family against 
the will and that she herself wished it so at all understand she said nicholas 
was silent and agreed with her her brother often wondered as he looked at her 
she did not seem at all like a girl in love and parted from her 
affianced husband she was even tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old 
this amazed nicholas and even made him regard courtship skeptically he could not believe that 
her fate was sealed especially as he had not seen her with prince andrew it 
always seemed to him that there was something not quite right about this intended marriage 
this delay why no betrothal he thought once when he had touched on this topic 
with his mother he discovered to his surprise and somewhat to his satisfaction that in 
the depth of her soul she too had doubts about this marriage see he writes 
said she showing her son a letter of prince with that latent grudge a mother 
always has in regard to a future married happiness writes that he come before december 
what can be keeping him illness probably his health is very delicate tell natásha and 
attach importance to her being so bright because living through the last days of her 
girlhood but i know what she is like every time we receive a letter from 
him however god grant that everything turns out well she always ended with these words 
is an excellent man chapter ii after reaching home nicholas was at first serious and 
even dull he was worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business 
matters for which his mother had called him home to throw off this burden as 
quickly as possible on the third day after his arrival he went angry and scowling 
and without answering questions as to where he was going to lodge and demanded an 
account of everything but what an account of everything might be nicholas knew even less 
than the frightened and bewildered mítenka the conversation and the examination of the accounts with 
mítenka did not last long the village elder a peasant delegate and the village clerk 
who were waiting in the passage heard with fear and delight first the young voice 
roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder and then words of abuse dreadful words 
ejaculated one after the other ungrateful wretch hack the dog to pieces not my father 
robbing us and so on then with no less fear and delight they saw how 
the young count red in the face and with bloodshot eyes dragged mítenka out by 
the scruff of the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with 
great agility at convenient moments between the words shouting off never let me see your 
face here again you villain mítenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away 
into the shrubbery this shrubbery was a well known haven of refuge for culprits at 
otrádnoe mítenka himself returning tipsy from the town used to hide there and many of 
the residents at otrádnoe hiding from mítenka knew of its protective qualities wife and sisters 
in law thrust their heads and frightened faces out of the door of a room 
where a bright samovar was boiling and where the high bedstead stood with its patchwork 
quilt the young count paid no heed to them but breathing hard passed by with 
resolute strides and went into the house the countess who heard at once from the 
maids what had happened at the lodge was calmed by the thought that now their 
affairs would certainly improve but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect 
this excitement might have on her son she went several times to his door on 
tiptoe and listened as he lighted one pipe after another next day the old count 
called his son aside and with an embarrassed smile said to him you know my 
dear boy a pity you got excited mítenka has told me all about it knew 
thought nicholas i should never understand anything in this crazy world were angry that he 
had not entered those 700 rubles but they were carried you did not look at 
the other page he is a blackguard and a thief i know he is and 
what i have done i have done but if you like i speak to him 
again my dear the count too felt embarrassed he knew he had mismanaged his property 
and was to blame toward his children but he did not know how to remedy 
it i beg you to attend to the business i am old i papa forgive 
me if i have caused you unpleasantness i understand it all less than you do 
take all these peasants and money matters and carryings forward from page to page he 
thought used to understand what a and the stakes at cards meant but carrying forward 
to another page i understand at all said he to himself and after that he 
did not meddle in business affairs but once the countess called her son and informed 
him that she had a promissory note from anna mikháylovna for two thousand rubles and 
asked him what he thought of doing with it answered nicholas say it rests with 
me well i like anna mikháylovna and i like borís but they were our friends 
and poor well then this and he tore up the note and by so doing 
caused the old countess to weep tears of joy after that young rostóv took no 
further part in any business affairs but devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was 
to him a new which his father kept a large establishment chapter iii the weather 
was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an earth saturated by autumn rains the 
verdure had thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of 
winter rye trodden down by the cattle and against the pale yellow stubble of the 
spring buckwheat the wooded ravines and the copses which at the end of august had 
still been green islands amid black fields and stubble had become golden and bright red 
islands amid the green winter rye the hares had already half changed their summer coats 
the fox cubs were beginning to scatter and the young wolves were bigger than dogs 
it was the best time of the year for the chase the hounds of that 
ardent young sportsman rostóv had not merely reached hard winter condition but were so jaded 
that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a three 
rest and then on the sixteenth of september to go on a distant expedition starting 
from the oak grove where there was an undisturbed litter of wolf cubs all that 
day the hounds remained at home it was frosty and the air was sharp but 
toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw on the fifteenth when 
young rostóv in his dressing gown looked out of the window he saw it was 
an unsurpassable morning for hunting it was as if the sky were melting and sinking 
to the earth without any wind the only motion in the air was that of 
the dripping microscopic particles of drizzling mist the bare twigs in the garden were hung 
with transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves the earth in the kitchen 
garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance 
merged into the dull moist veil of mist nicholas went out into the wet and 
muddy porch there was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog mílka a black 
spotted broad haunched bitch with prominent black eyes got up on seeing her master stretched 
her hind legs lay down like a hare and then suddenly jumped up and licked 
him right on his nose and mustache another borzoi a dog catching sight of his 
master from the garden path arched his back and rushing headlong toward the porch with 
lifted tail began rubbing himself against his legs hoy came at that moment that inimitable 
call which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor and round the corner came 
daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman a gray wrinkled old man with hair cut 
straight over his forehead ukrainian fashion a long bent whip in his hand and that 
look of independence and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen he doffed 
his circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully this scorn was not 
offensive to his master nicholas knew that this daniel disdainful of everybody and who considered 
himself above them was all the same his serf and huntsman nicholas said timidly conscious 
at the sight of the weather the hounds and the huntsman that he was being 
carried away by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his 
previous resolutions as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress orders your excellency 
said the huntsman in his deep bass deep as a proto and hoarse with two 
flashing black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master who was silent you 
resist it those eyes seemed to be asking a good day eh for a hunt 
and a gallop eh asked nicholas scratching mílka behind the ears daniel did not answer 
but winked instead sent uvárka at dawn to listen his bass boomed out after a 
pause says moved them into the otrádnoe enclosure they were howling there this meant that 
the she wolf about whom they both knew had moved with her cubs to the 
otrádnoe copse a small place a mile and a half from the house ought to 
go you think so said nicholas to me with uvárka you please put off feeding 
them sir five minutes later daniel and uvárka were standing in big study though daniel 
was not a big man to see him in a room was like seeing a 
horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and surroundings of human life 
daniel himself felt this and as usual stood just inside the door trying to speak 
softly and not move for fear of breaking something in the apartment and he hastened 
to say all that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling out 
into the open under the sky once more having finished his inquiries and extorted from 
daniel an opinion that the hounds were fit daniel himself wished to go hunting nicholas 
ordered the horses to be saddled but just as daniel was about to go natásha 
came in with rapid steps not having done up her hair or finished dressing and 
with her old big shawl wrapped round her pétya ran in at the same time 
are going asked natásha knew you would sónya said you go but i knew that 
today is the sort of day when you help going we are going replied nicholas 
reluctantly for today as he intended to hunt seriously he did not want to take 
natásha and pétya are going but only wolf hunting it would be dull for you 
know it is my greatest pleasure said natásha not fair you are going by yourself 
are having the horses saddled and said nothing to us about it barrier bars a 
go shouted pétya you mamma said you said nicholas to natásha go i shall certainly 
go said natásha decisively tell them to saddle for us and michael must come with 
my dogs she added to the huntsman it seemed to daniel irksome and improper to 
be in a room at all but to have anything to do with a young 
lady seemed to him impossible he cast down his eyes and hurried out as if 
it were none of his business careful as he went not to inflict any accidental 
injury on the young lady chapter iv the old count who had always kept up 
an enormous hunting establishment but had now handed it all completely over to his care 
being in very good spirits on this fifteenth of september prepared to go out with 
the others in an time the whole hunting party was at the porch nicholas with 
a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for attending to 
trifles went past natásha and pétya who were trying to tell him something he had 
a look at all the details of the hunt sent a pack of hounds and 
huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry mounted his chestnut donéts and whistling to his 
own leash of borzois set off across the threshing ground to a field leading to 
the otrádnoe wood the old horse a sorrel gelding called viflyánka was led by the 
groom in attendance on him while the count himself was to drive in a small 
trap straight to a spot reserved for him they were taking fifty four hounds with 
six hunt attendants and whippers in besides the family there were eight borzoi kennelmen and 
more than forty borzois so that with the borzois on the leash belonging to members 
of the family there were about a hundred and thirty dogs and twenty horsemen each 
dog knew its master and its call each man in the hunt knew his business 
his place what he had to do as soon as they had passed the fence 
they all spread out evenly and quietly without noise or talk along the road and 
field leading to the otrádnoe covert the horses stepped over the field as over a 
thick carpet now and then splashing into puddles as they crossed a road the misty 
sky still seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth the air was still 
warm and silent occasionally the whistle of a huntsman the snort of a horse the 
crack of a whip or the whine of a straggling hound could be heard when 
they had gone a little less than a mile five more riders with dogs appeared 
out of the mist approaching the rostóvs in front rode a fresh looking handsome old 
man with a large gray mustache morning uncle said nicholas when the old man drew 
near it come on i was sure of it began he was a distant relative 
of the a man of small means and their neighbor knew you be able to 
resist it and a good thing going it come on this was favorite expression the 
covert at once for my gírchik says the ilágins are at kornikí with their hounds 
it come on take the cubs from under your very nose where going shall we 
join up our packs asked nicholas the hounds were joined into one pack and and 
nicholas rode on side by side natásha muffled up in shawls which did not hide 
her eager face and shining eyes galloped up to them she was followed by pétya 
who always kept close to her by michael a huntsman and by a groom appointed 
to look after her pétya who was laughing whipped and pulled at his horse natásha 
sat easily and confidently on her black arábchik and reined him in without effort with 
a firm hand looked round disapprovingly at pétya and natásha he did not like to 
combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting morning uncle we are going too shouted 
pétya morning good morning but go overriding the hounds said sternly what a fine dog 
truníla is he knew me said natásha referring to her favorite hound the first place 
truníla is not a but a harrier thought nicholas and looked sternly at his sister 
trying to make her feel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment 
natásha understood it think be in way uncle she said go to our places and 
budge good thing too little countess said mind you fall off your horse he added 
it come on nothing to hold on to the oasis of the otrádnoe covert came 
in sight a few hundred yards off the huntsmen were already nearing it rostóv having 
finally settled with where they should set on the hounds and having shown natásha where 
she was to spot where nothing could possibly run round above the ravine nephew going 
for a big wolf said and let her slip as may happen answered rostóv here 
he shouted answering remark by this call to his borzoi karáy was a shaggy old 
dog with a hanging jowl famous for having tackled a big wolf unaided they all 
took up their places the old count knowing his ardor in the hunt hurried so 
as not to be late and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when 
count ilyá rostóv cheerful flushed and with quivering cheeks drove up with his black horses 
over the winter rye to the place reserved for him where a wolf might come 
out having straightened his coat and fastened on his hunting knives and horn he mounted 
his good sleek well fed and comfortable horse viflyánka which was turning gray like himself 
his horses and trap were sent home count ilyá rostóv though not at heart a 
keen sportsman knew the rules of the hunt well and rode to the bushy edge 
of the road where he was to stand arranged his reins settled himself in the 
saddle and feeling that he was ready looked about with a smile beside him was 
simon chekmár his personal attendant an old horseman now somewhat stiff in the saddle chekmár 
held in leash three formidable wolfhounds who had however grown fat like their master and 
his horse two wise old dogs lay down unleashed some hundred paces farther along the 
edge of the wood stood mítka the other groom a daring horseman and keen rider 
to hounds before the hunt by old custom the count had drunk a silver cupful 
of mulled brandy taken a snack and washed it down with half a bottle of 
his favorite bordeaux he was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive his eyes 
were rather moist and glittered more than usual and as he sat in his saddle 
wrapped up in his fur coat he looked like a child taken out for an 
outing the thin hollow cheeked chekmár having got everything ready kept glancing at his master 
with whom he had lived on the best of terms for thirty years and understanding 
the mood he was in expected a pleasant chat a third person rode up circumspectly 
through the wood it was plain that he had had a lesson and stopped behind 
the count this person was a gray bearded old man in a cloak with a 
tall peaked cap on his head he was the buffoon who went by a name 
nastásya ivánovna nastásya ivánovna whispered the count winking at him you scare away the beast 
give it you know a thing or two myself said nastásya ivánovna whispered the count 
and turned to simon you seen the young countess he asked is she young count 
peter by the zhárov rank grass answered simon smiling a lady very fond of hunting 
surprised at the way she rides simon eh said the count as good as many 
a man course marvelous so bold so easy nicholas where is he by the lyádov 
upland he sir he knows where to stand he understands the matter so well that 
daniel and i are often quite astounded said simon well knowing what would please his 
master well eh and how well he looks on his horse eh perfect picture how 
he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the zavárzinsk thicket the other 
day leaped a fearful place what a sight when they rushed from the covert the 
horse worth a thousand rubles and the rider beyond all price yes one would have 
to search far to find another as smart search far repeated the count evidently sorry 
simon had not said more search far he said turning back the skirt of his 
coat to get at his snuffbox other day when he came out from mass in 
full uniform michael sidórych simon did not finish for on the still air he had 
distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds giving tongue 
he bent down his head and listened shaking a warning finger at his master are 
on the scent of the cubs he whispered to the lyádov uplands the count forgetting 
to smooth out the smile on his face looked into the distance straight before him 
down the narrow open space holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any 
after the cry of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from 
hunting horn the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in 
full cry with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after 
a wolf the whippers in no longer set on the hounds but changed to the 
cry of ulyulyu and above the others rose voice now a deep bass now piercingly 
shrill his voice seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into 
the open field after listening a few moments in silence the count and his attendant 
convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs the sound of the larger 
pack eagerly giving tongue began to die away in the distance the other pack rushed 
by the wood past the count and it was with this that voice was heard 
calling ulyulyu the sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again but both were 
becoming more distant simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had 
entangled the count too sighed and noticing the snuffbox in his hand opened it and 
took a pinch cried simon to a borzoi that was pushing forward out of the 
wood the count started and dropped the snuffbox nastásya ivánovna dismounted to pick it up 
the count and simon were looking at him then unexpectedly as often happens the sound 
of the hunt suddenly approached as if the hounds in full cry and daniel ulyulyuing 
were just in front of them the count turned and saw on his right mítka 
staring at him with eyes starting out of his head raising his cap and pointing 
before him to the other side out he shouted in a voice plainly showing that 
he had long fretted to utter that word and letting the borzois slip he galloped 
toward the count the count and simon galloped out of the wood and saw on 
their left a wolf which softly swaying from side to side was coming at a 
quiet lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing the 
angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the feet at the 
wolf the wolf paused turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly like a man 
suffering from the quinsy and still slightly swaying from side to side gave a couple 
of leaps and with a swish of its tail disappeared into the skirt of the 
wood at the same instant with a cry like a wail first one hound then 
another and then another sprang helter skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack 
rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared the hazel 
bushes parted behind the hounds and chestnut horse appeared dark with sweat on its long 
back sat daniel hunched forward capless his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed perspiring 
face ulyulyu he cried when he caught sight of the count his eyes flashed lightning 
you he shouted holding up his whip threateningly at the count let the wolf go 
what sportsmen and as if scorning to say more to the frightened and shamefaced count 
he lashed the heaving flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the 
count had aroused and flew off after the hounds the count like a punished schoolboy 
looked round trying by a smile to win sympathy for his plight but simon was 
no longer there he was galloping round by the bushes while the field was coming 
up on both sides all trying to head the wolf but it vanished into the 
wood before they could do so chapter v nicholas rostóv meanwhile remained at his post 
waiting for the wolf by the way the hunt approached and receded by the cries 
of the dogs whose notes were familiar to him by the way the voices of 
the huntsmen approached receded and rose he realized what was happening at the copse he 
knew that young and old wolves were there that the hounds had separated into two 
packs that somewhere a wolf was being chased and that something had gone wrong he 
expected the wolf to come his way any moment he made thousands of different conjectures 
as to where and from what side the beast would come and how he would 
set upon it hope alternated with despair several times he addressed a prayer to god 
that the wolf should come his way he prayed with that passionate and shamefaced feeling 
with which men pray at moments of great excitement arising from trivial causes would it 
be to thee to do this for me he said to god know thou art 
great and that it is a sin to ask this of thee but for sake 
do let the old wolf come my way and let karáy spring at sight of 
who is watching from over seize it by the throat in a death grip a 
thousand times during that half hour rostóv cast eager and restless glances over the edge 
of the wood with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth and the 
gully with its water worn side and cap just visible above the bush on his 
right i have such luck thought rostóv what it be worth it is not to 
be everywhere at cards and in war i am always unlucky memories of austerlitz and 
of dólokhov flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind once in my life to get 
an old wolf i want only that thought he straining eyes and ears and looking 
to the left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of 
note in the cries of the dogs again he looked to the right and saw 
something running toward him across the deserted field it be thought rostóv taking a deep 
breath as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for the height 
of happiness was so simply without warning or noise or display that rostóv could not 
believe his eyes and remained in doubt for over a second the wolf ran forward 
and jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path she was an old 
animal with a gray back and big reddish belly she ran without hurry evidently feeling 
sure that no one saw her rostóv holding his breath looked round at the borzois 
they stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation old karáy had 
turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas baring his yellow teeth and snapping 
at his hind legs whispered rostóv pouting his lips the borzois jumped up jerking the 
rings of the leashes and pricking their ears karáy finished scratching his hindquarters and cocking 
his ears got up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down 
i loose them or not nicholas asked himself as the wolf approached him coming from 
the copse suddenly the whole physiognomy changed she shuddered seeing what she had probably never 
seen eyes fixed upon turning her head a little toward rostóv she paused or forward 
eh no matter forward the wolf seemed to say to herself and she moved forward 
without again looking round and with a quiet long easy yet resolute lope cried nicholas 
in a voice not his own and of its own accord his good horse darted 
headlong downhill leaping over gullies to head off the wolf and the borzois passed it 
running faster still nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was 
galloping nor see the borzois nor the ground over which he went he saw only 
the wolf who increasing her speed bounded on in the same direction along the hollow 
the first to come into view was mílka with her black markings and powerful quarters 
gaining upon the wolf nearer and nearer now she was ahead of it but the 
wolf turned its head to face her and instead of putting on speed as she 
usually did mílka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs shouted nicholas the reddish 
lyubím rushed forward from behind mílka sprang impetuously at the wolf and seized it by 
its hindquarters but immediately jumped aside in terror the wolf crouched gnashed her teeth and 
again rose and bounded forward followed at the distance of a couple of feet by 
all the borzois who did not get any closer to her get away no impossible 
thought nicholas still shouting with a hoarse voice ulyulyu he shouted looking round for the 
old borzoi who was now his only hope karáy with all the strength age had 
left him stretched himself to the utmost and watching the wolf galloped heavily aside to 
intercept it but the quickness of the lope and the slower pace made it plain 
that karáy had miscalculated nicholas could already see not far in front of him the 
wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it but coming toward him 
he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf there was still 
hope a long yellowish young borzoi one nicholas did not know from another leash rushed 
impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over but the wolf 
jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and gnashing her teeth flew at 
the yellowish borzoi which with a piercing yelp fell with its head on the ground 
bleeding from a gash in its side old fellow wailed nicholas thanks to the delay 
caused by this crossing of the path the old dog with its felted hair hanging 
from its thigh was within five paces of it as if aware of her danger 
the wolf turned her eyes on karáy tucked her tail yet further between her legs 
and increased her speed but here nicholas only saw that something happened to borzoi was 
suddenly on the wolf and they rolled together down into a gully just in front 
of them that instant when nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with the 
dogs while from under them could be seen her gray hair and outstretched hind leg 
and her frightened choking head with her ears laid back karáy was pinning her by 
the throat was the happiest moment of his life with his hand on his saddlebow 
he was ready to dismount and stab the wolf when she suddenly thrust her head 
up from among that mass of dogs and then her forepaws were on the edge 
of the gully she clicked her teeth karáy no longer had her by the throat 
leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully and having disengaged 
herself from the dogs with tail tucked in again went forward karáy his hair bristling 
and probably bruised or wounded climbed with difficulty out of the gully my god why 
nicholas cried in despair huntsman was galloping from the other side across the path and 
his borzois once more stopped the advance she was again hemmed in nicholas and his 
attendant with and his huntsman were all riding round the wolf crying shouting and preparing 
to dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back and starting forward again every time 
she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she would be safe already at 
the beginning of this chase daniel hearing the ulyulyuing had rushed out from the wood 
he saw karáy seize the wolf and checked his horse supposing the affair to be 
over but when he saw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf 
shook herself and ran for safety daniel set his chestnut galloping not at the wolf 
but straight toward the wood just as karáy had run to cut the animal off 
as a result of this he galloped up to the wolf just when she had 
been stopped a second time by borzois daniel galloped up silently holding a naked dagger 
in his left hand and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his 
whip as if it were a flail nicholas neither saw nor heard daniel until the 
chestnut breathing heavily panted past him and he heard the fall of a body and 
saw daniel lying on the back among the dogs trying to seize her by the 
ears it was evident to the dogs the hunters and to the wolf herself that 
all was now over the terrified wolf pressed back her ears and tried to rise 
but the borzois stuck to her daniel rose a little took a step and with 
his whole weight as if lying down to rest fell on the wolf seizing her 
by the ears nicholas was about to stab her but daniel whispered gag her and 
changing his position set his foot on the neck a stick was thrust between her 
jaws and she was fastened with a leash as if bridled her legs were bound 
together and daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to side with happy 
exhausted faces they laid the old wolf alive on a shying and snorting horse and 
accompanied by the dogs yelping at her took her to the place where they were 
all to meet the hounds had killed two of the cubs and the borzois three 
the huntsmen assembled with their booty and their stories and all came to look at 
the wolf which with her broad browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between 
her jaws gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding 
her when she was touched she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly yet simply 
at everybody old count rostóv also rode up and touched the wolf what a formidable 
one said he formidable one eh he asked daniel who was standing near your excellency 
answered daniel quickly doffing his cap the count remembered the wolf he had let slip 
and his encounter with daniel but you are a crusty fellow friend said the count 
for sole reply daniel gave him a shy childlike meek and amiable smile chapter vi 
the old count went home and natásha and pétya promised to return very soon but 
as it was still early the hunt went farther at midday they put the hounds 
into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees nicholas standing in a fallow field could 
see all his whips facing him lay a field of winter rye there his own 
huntsman stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush the hounds had scarcely been 
loosed before nicholas heard one he knew voltórn giving tongue at intervals other hounds joined 
in now pausing and now again giving tongue a moment later he heard a cry 
from the wooded ravine that a fox had been found and the whole pack joining 
together rushed along the ravine toward the ryefield and away from nicholas he saw the 
whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the ravine he even saw 
the hounds and was expecting a fox to show itself at any moment on the 
ryefield opposite the huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois and nicholas 
saw a queer short legged red fox with a fine brush going hard across the 
field the borzois bore down on it now they drew close to the fox which 
began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper curves trailing its brush when 
suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one and everything was 
in confusion the borzois formed a star shaped figure scarcely swaying their bodies and with 
tails turned away from the center of the group two huntsmen galloped up to the 
dogs one in a red cap the other a stranger in a green coat this 
thought nicholas that huntsman from he is not man the huntsmen got the fox but 
stayed there a long time without strapping it to the saddle their horses bridled and 
with high saddles stood near them and there too the dogs were lying the huntsmen 
waved their arms and did something to the fox then from that spot came the 
sound of a horn with the signal agreed on in case of a fight huntsman 
having a row with our iván said groom nicholas sent the man to call natásha 
and pétya to him and rode at a footpace to the place where the whips 
were getting the hounds together several of the field galloped to the spot where the 
fight was going on nicholas dismounted and with natásha and pétya who had ridden up 
stopped near the hounds waiting to see how the matter would end out of the 
bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his young master with 
the fox tied to his crupper while still at a distance he took off his 
cap and tried to speak respectfully but he was pale and breathless and his face 
was angry one of his eyes was black but he probably was not even aware 
of it has happened asked nicholas likely thing killing a fox our dogs had hunted 
and it was my gray bitch that caught it go to law indeed he snatches 
at the fox i gave him one with the fox here it is on my 
saddle do you want a taste of this said the huntsman pointing to his dagger 
and probably imagining himself still speaking to his foe nicholas not stopping to talk to 
the man asked his sister and pétya to wait for him and rode to the 
spot where the hunting party was the victorious huntsman rode off to join the field 
and there surrounded by inquiring sympathizers recounted his exploits the facts were that ilágin with 
whom the rostóvs had a quarrel and were at law hunted over places that belonged 
by custom to the rostóvs and had now as if purposely sent his men to 
the very woods the rostóvs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their 
dogs had chased nicholas though he had never seen ilágin with his usual absence of 
moderation in judgment hated him cordially from reports of his arbitrariness and violence and regarded 
him as his bitterest foe he rode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping his 
whip and fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his 
enemy hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in 
a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven black horse accompanied by 
two hunt servants instead of an enemy nicholas found in ilágin a stately and courteous 
gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young acquaintance having ridden up to nicholas 
ilágin raised his beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would 
have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone 
borzois he hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited him to draw 
his covert natásha afraid that her brother would do something dreadful had followed him in 
some excitement seeing the enemies exchanging friendly greetings she rode up to them ilágin lifted 
his beaver cap still higher to natásha and said with a pleasant smile that the 
young countess resembled diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her 
beauty of which he had heard much to expiate his offense ilágin pressed the rostóvs 
to come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept 
for himself and which he said swarmed with hares nicholas agreed and the hunt now 
doubled moved on the way to upland was across the fields the hunt servants fell 
into line the masters rode together rostóv and ilágin kept stealthily glancing at one dogs 
trying not to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their 
own borzois rostóv was particularly struck by the beauty of a small pure bred red 
spotted bitch on leash slender but with muscles like steel a delicate muzzle and prominent 
black eyes he had heard of the swiftness of borzois and in that beautiful bitch 
saw a rival to his own mílka in the middle of a sober conversation begun 
by ilágin about the harvest nicholas pointed to the red spotted bitch fine little bitch 
that said he in a careless tone she swift one yes a good dog gets 
what after answered ilágin indifferently of the red spotted bitch erzá for which a year 
before he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs in your parts too 
the harvest is nothing to boast of count he went on continuing the conversation they 
had begun and considering it polite to return the young compliment ilágin looked at his 
borzois and picked out mílka who attracted his attention by her breadth black spotted one 
of yours is shaped said he fast enough replied nicholas and thought only a full 
grown hare would cross the field now show you what sort of borzoi she is 
and turning to his groom he said he would give a ruble to anyone who 
found a hare understand continued ilágin some sportsmen can be so jealous about game and 
dogs for myself i can tell you count i enjoy riding in company such as 
this what could be better he again raised his cap to natásha as for counting 
skins and what one takes i care about that course not being upset because someone 
borzoi and not mine catches something all i care about is to enjoy seeing the 
chase is it not so count for i consider that tu came the long drawn 
cry of one of the borzoi whippers in who had halted he stood on a 
knoll in the stubble holding his whip aloft and again repeated his long drawn cry 
tu this call and the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare he 
has found one i think said ilágin carelessly we must ride up shall we both 
course it answered nicholas seeing in erzá and red rugáy two rivals he had never 
yet had a chance of pitting against his own borzois suppose they outdo my mílka 
at once he thought as he rode with and ilágin toward the hare full grown 
one asked ilágin as he approached the whip who had sighted the not without agitation 
he looked round and whistled to erzá you michael nikanórovich he said addressing the latter 
was riding with a sullen expression on his face can i join in why given 
a village for each of your borzois it come on yours are worth thousands try 
yours against one another you two and look on hey hey he shouted he added 
involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this red 
borzoi natásha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and her brother were 
trying to conceal and was herself excited by it the huntsman stood halfway up the 
knoll holding up his whip and the gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace 
the hounds that were far off on the horizon turned away from the hare and 
the whips but not the gentlefolk also moved away all were moving slowly and sedately 
is it pointing asked nicholas riding a hundred paces toward the whip who had sighted 
the hare but before the whip could reply the hare scenting the frost coming next 
morning was unable to rest and leaped up the pack on leash rushed downhill in 
full cry after the hare and from all sides the borzois that were not on 
leash darted after the hounds and the hare all the hunt who had been moving 
slowly shouted calling in the hounds while the borzoi whips with a cry of tu 
galloped across the field setting the borzois on the hare the tranquil ilágin nicholas natásha 
and flew reckless of where and how they went seeing only the borzois and the 
hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant of the chase the 
hare they had started was a strong and swift one when he jumped up he 
did not run at once but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling 
that resounded from all sides at once he took a dozen bounds not very quickly 
letting the borzois gain on him and finally having chosen his direction and realized his 
danger laid back his ears and rushed off headlong he had been lying in the 
stubble but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft 
the two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him having been the nearest were 
the first to see and pursue him but they had not gone far before red 
spotted erzá passed them got within a length flew at the hare with terrible swiftness 
aiming at his scut and thinking she had seized him rolled over like a ball 
the hare arched his back and bounded off yet more swiftly from behind erzá rushed 
the broad haunched black spotted mílka and began rapidly gaining on the hare dear rose 
triumphant cry it looked as if mílka would immediately pounce on the hare but she 
overtook him and flew past the hare had squatted again the beautiful erzá reached him 
but when close to the scut paused as if measuring the distance so as not 
to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg darling ilágin wailed in 
a voice unlike his own erzá did not hearken to his appeal at the very 
moment when she would have seized her prey the hare moved and darted along the 
balk between the winter rye and the stubble again erzá and mílka were abreast running 
like a pair of carriage horses and began to overtake the hare but it was 
easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake 
him so quickly rugáyushka it come on came a third voice just then and red 
borzoi straining and curving its back caught up with the two foremost borzois pushed ahead 
of them regardless of the terrible strain put on speed close to the hare knocked 
it off the balk onto the ryefield again put on speed still more viciously sinking 
to his knees in the muddy field and all one could see was how muddying 
his back he rolled over with the hare a ring of borzois surrounded him a 
moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs only the delighted dismounted 
and cut off a pad shaking the hare for the blood to drip off and 
anxiously glancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched he spoke without 
himself knowing whom to or what about it come on a dog there it has 
beaten them all the thousand ruble as well as the one ruble borzois it come 
on said he panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone as 
if they were all his enemies and had insulted him and only now had he 
at last succeeded in justifying himself are your thousand ruble ones it come on a 
pad for you he said throwing down the muddy pad deserved it it come on 
tired herself out run it down three times by herself said nicholas also not listening 
to anyone and regardless of whether he were heard or not what is there in 
running across it like that said groom she had missed it and turned it away 
any mongrel could take it ilágin was saying at the same time breathless from his 
gallop and his excitement at the same moment natásha without drawing breath screamed joyously ecstatically 
and so piercingly that it set ear tingling by that shriek she expressed what the 
others expressed by all talking at once and it was so strange that she must 
herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been 
amazed at it at any other time himself twisted up the hare threw it neatly 
and smartly across his back as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody 
and with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone mounted his bay and 
rode off the others all followed dispirited and shamefaced and only much later were they 
able to regain their former affectation of indifference for a long time they continued to 
look at red rugáy who his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring 
of his leash walked along just behind horse with the serene air of a conqueror 
i am like any other dog as long as not a question of coursing but 
when it is then look out his appearance seemed to nicholas to be saying when 
much later rode up to nicholas and began talking to him he felt flattered that 
after what had happened deigned to speak to him chapter vii toward evening ilágin took 
leave of nicholas who found that they were so far from home that he accepted 
offer that the hunting party should spend the night in his little village of mikháylovna 
if you put up at my house that will be better still it come on 
said see damp weather and you could rest and the little countess could be driven 
home in a trap offer was accepted a huntsman was sent to otrádnoe for a 
trap while nicholas rode with natásha and pétya to house some five male domestic serfs 
big and little rushed out to the front porch to meet their master a score 
of women serfs old and young as well as children popped out from the back 
entrance to have a look at the hunters who were arriving the presence of woman 
a lady and on the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that many 
of them came up to her stared her in the face and unabashed by her 
presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not 
a human being able to hear or understand what was said about her look she 
sits sideways there she sits and her skirt dangles see got a little hunting horn 
gracious see her knife she a tartar is it you go head over heels asked 
the boldest of all addressing natásha directly dismounted at the porch of his little wooden 
house which stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and after a glance at 
his retainers shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take themselves off and that all 
necessary preparations should be made to receive the guests and the visitors the serfs all 
dispersed lifted natásha off her horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety 
wooden steps of the porch the house with its bare unplastered log walls was not 
did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it neither was it 
noticeably neglected in the entry there was a smell of fresh apples and wolf and 
fox skins hung about led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with 
a folding table and red chairs then into the drawing room with a round birchwood 
table and a sofa and finally into his private room where there was a tattered 
sofa a worn carpet and portraits of suvórov of the father and mother and of 
himself in military uniform the study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs asked his visitors 
to sit down and make themselves at home and then went out of the room 
rugáy his back still muddy came into the room and lay down on the sofa 
cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth leading from the study was a passage in 
which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen from behind this came laughter and 
whispers natásha nicholas and pétya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa 
pétya leaning on his elbow fell asleep at once natásha and nicholas were silent their 
faces glowed they were hungry and very cheerful they looked at one another now that 
the hunt was over and they were in the house nicholas no longer considered it 
necessary to show his manly superiority over his sister natásha gave him a wink and 
neither refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had 
a pretext ready to account for it after a while came in in a cossack 
coat blue trousers and small top boots and natásha felt that this costume the very 
one she had regarded with surprise and amusement at otrádnoe was just the right thing 
and not at all worse than a swallow tail or frock coat too was in 
high spirits and far from being offended by the and laughter it could never enter 
his head that they might be laughing at his way of life he himself joined 
in the merriment right young countess it come on i never saw anyone like her 
said he offering nicholas a pipe with a long stem and with a practiced motion 
of three fingers taking down another that had been cut short ridden all day like 
a man and is as fresh as ever soon after reappearance the door was opened 
evidently from the sound by a barefooted girl and a stout rosy good looking woman 
of about forty with a double chin and full red lips entered carrying a large 
loaded tray with hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance and in every motion she 
looked at the visitors and with a pleasant smile bowed respectfully in spite of her 
exceptional stoutness which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her 
head this woman who was housekeeper trod very lightly she went to the table set 
down the tray and with her plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles 
and various hors and dishes and arranged them on the table when she had finished 
she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her face i 
am i am she now do you understand her expression said to rostóv how could 
one help understanding not only nicholas but even natásha understood the meaning of his puckered 
brow and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when anísya fëdorovna entered 
on the tray was a bottle of herb wine different kinds of vodka pickled mushrooms 
rye cakes made with buttermilk honey in the comb still mead and sparkling mead apples 
nuts raw and roasted and nut and honey sweets afterwards she brought a freshly roasted 
chicken ham preserves made with honey and preserves made with sugar all this was the 
fruit of anísya housekeeping gathered and prepared by her the smell and taste of it 
all had a smack of anísya fëdorovna herself a savor of juiciness cleanliness whiteness and 
pleasant smiles this little lady countess she kept saying as she offered natásha first one 
thing and then another natásha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or 
eaten such buttermilk cakes such aromatic jam such honey and nut sweets or such a 
chicken anywhere anísya fëdorovna left the room after supper over their cherry brandy rostóv and 
talked of past and future hunts of rugáy and dogs while natásha sat upright on 
the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes she tried several times to wake pétya that 
he might eat something but he only muttered incoherent words without waking up natásha felt 
so lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would 
come for her too soon after a casual pause such as often occurs when receiving 
friends for the first time in own house answering a thought that was in his 
minds said you see is how i am finishing my days death will come it 
come on nothing will remain then why harm anyone face was very significant and even 
handsome as he said this involuntarily rostóv recalled all the good he had heard about 
him from his father and the neighbors throughout the whole province had the reputation of 
being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks they called him in to decide family 
disputes chose him as executor confided secrets to him elected him to be a justice 
and to other posts but he always persistently refused public appointments passing the autumn and 
spring in the fields on his bay gelding sitting at home in winter and lying 
in his overgrown garden in summer you enter the service uncle did once but gave 
it up i am not fit for it it come on i make head or 
tail of it for brains enough now hunting is another it come on open the 
door there he shouted have you shut it the door at the end of the 
passage led to the room as they called the room for the hunt servants there 
was a rapid patter of bare feet and an unseen hand opened the door into 
the room from which came the clear sounds of a balaláyka on which someone who 
was evidently a master of the art was playing natásha had been listening to those 
strains for some time and now went out into the passage to hear better mítka 
my coachman i have got him a good balaláyka fond of it said it was 
the custom for mítka to play the balaláyka in the room when returned from the 
chase was fond of such music good really very good said nicholas with some unintentional 
superciliousness as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him very much good said 
natásha reproachfully noticing her tone simply delicious just as pickled mushrooms honey and cherry brandy 
had seemed to her the best in the world so also that song at that 
moment seemed to her the acme of musical delight please more cried natásha at the 
door as soon as the balaláyka ceased mítka tuned up afresh and recommenced thrumming the 
balaláyka to the air of my lady with trills and variations sat listening slightly smiling 
with his head on one side the air was repeated a hundred times the balaláyka 
was retuned several times and the same notes were thrummed again but the listeners did 
not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again anísya fëdorovna 
came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost like listening she said to 
natásha with a smile extremely like a good player of ours she added play that 
part right said suddenly with an energetic gesture he ought to burst it come on 
to burst out you play then asked natásha did not answer but smiled go and 
see if the strings of my guitar are all right i touched it for a 
long time on given it up anísya fëdorovna with her light step willingly went to 
fulfill her errand and brought back the guitar without looking at anyone blew the dust 
off it and tapping the case with his bony fingers tuned the guitar and settled 
himself in his armchair he took the guitar a little above the fingerboard arching his 
left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture and with a wink at anísya fëdorovna struck 
a single chord pure and sonorous and then quietly smoothly and confidently began playing in 
very slow time not my lady but the well known song came a maiden down 
the street the tune played with precision and in exact time began to thrill in 
the hearts of nicholas and natásha arousing in them the same kind of sober mirth 
as radiated from anísya whole being anísya fëdorovna flushed and drawing her kerchief over her 
face went laughing out of the room continued to play correctly carefully with energetic firmness 
looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot where anísya fëdorovna had just 
stood something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of his face under 
his gray mustaches especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when 
here and there as he ran his fingers over the strings something seemed to snap 
lovely go on uncle go on shouted natásha as soon as he had finished she 
jumped up and hugged and kissed him nicholas she said turning to her brother as 
if asking him is it moves me so nicholas too was greatly pleased by playing 
and played the piece over again anísya smiling face reappeared in the doorway and behind 
hers other faces fetching water clear and sweet stop dear maiden i played once more 
running his fingers skillfully over the strings and then he stopped short and jerked his 
shoulders on uncle dear natásha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life depended 
on it rose and it was as if there were two men in him one 
of them smiled seriously at the merry fellow while the merry fellow struck a naïve 
and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance then niece he exclaimed waving to natásha 
the hand that had just struck a chord natásha threw off the shawl from her 
shoulders ran forward to face and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with 
her shoulders and struck an attitude where how and when had this young countess educated 
by an émigrée french governess imbibed from the russian air she breathed that spirit and 
obtained that manner which the pas de châle would one would have supposed long ago 
have effaced but the spirit and the movements were those inimitable and unteachable russian ones 
that had expected of her as soon as she had struck her pose and smiled 
triumphantly proudly and with sly merriment the fear that had at first seized nicholas and 
the others that she might not do the right thing was at an end and 
they were already admiring her the french shawl dance she did the right thing with 
such precision such complete precision that anísya fëdorovna who had at once handed her the 
handkerchief she needed for the dance had tears in her eyes though she laughed as 
she watched this slim graceful countess reared in silks and velvets and so different from 
herself who yet was able to understand all that was in anísya and in father 
and mother and aunt and in every russian man and woman little countess on cried 
with a joyous laugh having finished the dance done niece now a fine young fellow 
must be found as husband for you on chosen already said nicholas smiling said in 
surprise looking inquiringly at natásha who nodded her head with a happy smile such a 
one she said but as soon as she had said it a new train of 
thoughts and feelings arose in her did smile mean when he said is he glad 
of it or not it is as if he thought my bolkónski would not approve 
of or understand our gaiety but he would understand it all where is he now 
she thought and her face suddenly became serious but this lasted only a second dare 
to think about it she said to herself and sat down again smilingly beside begging 
him to play something more played another song and a valse then after a pause 
he cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song as growing dark last night 
fell the snow so soft and light sang as peasants sing with full and naïve 
conviction that the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the 
tune comes of itself and that apart from the words there is no tune which 
exists only to give measure to the words as a result of this the unconsidered 
tune like the song of a bird was extraordinarily good natásha was in ecstasies over 
singing she resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar 
she asked for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song after 
nine two traps and three mounted men who had been sent to look for them 
arrived to fetch natásha and pétya the count and countess did not know where they 
were and were very anxious said one of the men pétya was carried out like 
a log and laid in the larger of the two traps natásha and nicholas got 
into the other wrapped natásha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a 
new tenderness he accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not 
be crossed so that they had to go round by the ford and he sent 
huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns by dear niece his voice called out of 
the the voice natásha had known previously but the one that had sung as growing 
dark last night in the village through which they passed there were red lights and 
a cheerful smell of smoke a darling uncle is said natásha when they had come 
out onto the highroad returned nicholas not cold quite quite all right i feel so 
comfortable answered natásha almost perplexed by her feelings they remained silent a long while the 
night was dark and damp they could not see the horses but only heard them 
splashing through the unseen mud what was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so 
eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life how did they all find 
place in her but she was very happy as they were nearing home she suddenly 
struck up the air of as growing dark last tune of which she had all 
the way been trying to get and had at last caught it said nicholas were 
you thinking about just now nicholas inquired natásha they were fond of asking one another 
that question said nicholas trying to remember you see first i thought that rugáy the 
red hound was like uncle and that if he were a man he would always 
keep uncle near him if not for his riding then for his manner what a 
good fellow uncle is you think so well and you wait a bit wait yes 
first i thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home 
but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness and that we 
shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in otrádnoe but in fairyland and 
then i thought no nothing else know i expect you thought of him said nicholas 
smiling as natásha knew by the sound of his voice said natásha though she had 
in reality been thinking about prince andrew at the same time as of the rest 
and of how he would have liked then i was saying to myself all the 
way well anísya carried herself how well and nicholas heard her spontaneous happy ringing laughter 
do you know she suddenly said know that i shall never again be as happy 
and tranquil as i am now nonsense humbug exclaimed nicholas and he thought charming this 
natásha of mine is i have no other friend like her and never shall have 
why should she marry we might always drive about together a darling this nicholas of 
mine is thought natásha there are still lights in the drawing room she said pointing 
to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety darkness of 
the night chapter viii count ilyá rostóv had resigned the position of marshal of the 
nobility because it involved him in too much expense but still his affairs did not 
improve natásha and nicholas often noticed their parents conferring together anxiously and privately and heard 
suggestions of selling the fine ancestral rostóv house and estate near moscow it was not 
necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been marshal and life at 
otrádnoe was quieter than in former years but still the enormous house and its lodges 
were full of people and more than twenty sat down to table every day these 
were all their own people who had settled down in the house almost as members 
of the family or persons who were it seemed obliged to live in the house 
such were dimmler the musician and his wife vogel the dancing master and his family 
belóva an old maiden lady an inmate of the house and many others such as 
tutors the former governess and other people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous 
to live in the house than at home they had not as many visitors as 
before but the old habits of life without which the count and countess could not 
conceive of existence remained unchanged there was still the hunting establishment which nicholas had even 
enlarged the same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables the same expensive presents 
and dinner parties to the whole district on name days there were still the games 
of whist and boston at out his cards so that everybody could see let himself 
be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors who looked upon an 
opportunity to play a rubber with count rostóv as a most profitable source of income 
the count moved in his affairs as in a huge net trying not to believe 
that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step and feeling 
too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and patiently to 
disentangle them the countess with her loving heart felt that her children were being ruined 
that it was not the fault for he could not help being what he though 
he tried to hide it he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and 
his ruin and she tried to find means of remedying the position from her feminine 
point of view she could see only one solution namely for nicholas to marry a 
rich heiress she felt this to be their last hope and that if nicholas refused 
the match she had found for him she would have to abandon the hope of 
ever getting matters right this match was with julie karágina the daughter of excellent and 
virtuous parents a girl the rostóvs had known from childhood and who had now become 
a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers the countess had 
written direct to mother in moscow suggesting a marriage between their children and had received 
a favorable answer from her karágina had replied that for her part she was agreeable 
and everything depend on her inclination she invited nicholas to come to moscow several times 
the countess with tears in her eyes told her son that now both her daughters 
were settled her only wish was to see him married she said she could lie 
down in her grave peacefully if that were accomplished then she told him that she 
knew of a splendid girl and tried to discover what he thought about marriage at 
other times she praised julie to him and advised him to go to moscow during 
the holidays to amuse himself nicholas guessed what his remarks were leading to and during 
one of these conversations induced her to speak quite frankly she told him that her 
only hope of getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying julie karágina mamma 
suppose i loved a girl who has no fortune would you expect me to sacrifice 
my feelings and my honor for the sake of money he asked his mother not 
realizing the cruelty of his question and only wishing to show his noble mindedness you 
have not understood me said his mother not knowing how to justify herself have not 
understood me nikólenka it is your happiness i wish for she added feeling that she 
was telling an untruth and was becoming entangled she began to cry cry only tell 
me that you wish it and you know i will give my life anything to 
put you at ease said nicholas would sacrifice anything for my feelings but the countess 
did not want the question put like that she did not want a sacrifice from 
her son she herself wished to make a sacrifice for him you have not understood 
me let us talk about it she replied wiping away her tears i do love 
a poor girl said nicholas to himself i to sacrifice my feelings and my honor 
for money i wonder how mamma could speak so to me because sónya is poor 
i must not love her he thought not respond to her faithful devoted love yet 
i should certainly be happier with her than with some doll like julie i can 
always sacrifice my feelings for my welfare he said to himself i coerce my feelings 
if i love sónya that feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else 
nicholas did not go to moscow and the countess did not renew the conversation with 
him about marriage she saw with sorrow and sometimes with exasperation symptoms of a growing 
attachment between her son and the portionless sónya though she blamed herself for it she 
could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying sónya often pulling her up without reason 
addressing her stiffly as dear and using the formal instead of the intimate in speaking 
to her the kindhearted countess was the more vexed with sónya because that poor dark 
eyed niece of hers was so meek so kind so devotedly grateful to her benefactors 
and so faithfully unchangingly and unselfishly in love with nicholas that there were no grounds 
for finding fault with her nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home 
a fourth letter had come from prince andrew from rome in which he wrote that 
he would have been on his way back to russia long ago had not his 
wound unexpectedly reopened in the warm climate which obliged him to defer his return till 
the beginning of the new year natásha was still as much in love with her 
betrothed found the same comfort in that love and was still as ready to throw 
herself into all the pleasures of life as before but at the end of the 
fourth month of their separation she began to have fits of depression which she could 
not master she felt sorry for herself sorry that she was being wasted all this 
time and of no use to she felt herself so capable of loving and being 
loved things were not cheerful in the home chapter ix christmas came and except for 
the ceremonial mass the solemn and wearisome christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants and the 
new dresses everyone put on there were no special festivities though the calm frost of 
twenty degrees réaumur the dazzling sunshine by day and the starlight of the winter nights 
seemed to call for some special celebration of the season on the third day of 
christmas week after the midday dinner all the inmates of the house dispersed to various 
rooms it was the dullest time of the day nicholas who had been visiting some 
neighbors that morning was asleep on the sitting room sofa the old count was resting 
in his study sónya sat in the drawing room at the round table copying a 
design for embroidery the countess was playing patience nastásya ivánovna the buffoon sat with a 
sad face at the window with two old ladies natásha came into the room went 
up to sónya glanced at what she was doing and then went up to her 
mother and stood without speaking are you wandering about like an outcast asked her mother 
do you want i want him now this minute i want him said natásha with 
glittering eyes and no sign of a smile the countess lifted her head and looked 
attentively at her daughter look at me mamma look i shall cry directly down with 
me a little said the countess i want him why should i be wasted like 
this mamma her voice broke tears gushed from her eyes and she turned quickly to 
hide them and left the room she passed into the sitting room stood there thinking 
awhile and then went into the room there an old maidservant was grumbling at a 
young girl who stood panting having just run in through the cold from the quarters 
a time for everything said the old woman her alone kondrátevna said natásha mavrúshka go 
having released mavrúshka natásha crossed the dancing hall and went to the vestibule there an 
old footman and two young ones were playing cards they broke off and rose as 
she entered can i do with them thought natásha nikíta please go where can i 
send him yes go to the yard and fetch a fowl please a cock and 
you misha bring me some oats a few oats said misha cheerfully and readily go 
quickly the old man urged him you theodore get me a piece of chalk on 
her way past the pantry she told them to set a samovar though it was 
not at all the time for tea fóka the butler was the most ill tempered 
person in the house natásha liked to test her power over him he distrusted the 
order and asked whether the samovar was really wanted dear what a young lady said 
fóka pretending to frown at natásha no one in the house sent people about or 
gave them as much trouble as natásha did she could not see people unconcernedly but 
had to send them on some errand she seemed to be trying whether any of 
them would get angry or sulky with her but the serfs fulfilled no orders so 
readily as they did hers can i do where can i go thought she as 
she went slowly along the passage ivánovna what sort of children shall i have she 
asked the buffoon who was coming toward her in a jacket fleas crickets grasshoppers answered 
the buffoon lord o lord always the same oh where am i to go what 
am i to do with myself and tapping with her heels she ran quickly upstairs 
to see vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story two governesses were 
sitting with the vogels at a table on which were plates of raisins walnuts and 
almonds the governesses were discussing whether it was cheaper to live in moscow or odessa 
natásha sat down listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air and then 
got up again island of madagascar she said da gas car she repeated articulating each 
syllable distinctly and not replying to madame schoss who asked her what she was saying 
she went out of the room her brother pétya was upstairs too with the man 
in attendance on him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night pétya she 
called to him me downstairs pétya ran up and offered her his back she jumped 
on it putting her arms round his neck and he pranced along with her the 
island of madagascar she said and jumping off his back she went downstairs having as 
it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made sure that everyone was submissive 
but that all the same it was dull natásha betook herself to the ballroom picked 
up her guitar sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase and began to 
run her fingers over the strings in the bass picking out a passage she recalled 
from an opera she had heard in petersburg with prince andrew what she drew from 
the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners but in her imagination a 
whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds she sat behind the bookcase with her 
eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and listened to 
herself and pondered she was in a mood for brooding on the past sónya passed 
to the pantry with a glass in her hand natásha glanced at her and at 
the crack in the pantry door and it seemed to her that she remembered the 
light falling through that crack once before and sónya passing with a glass in her 
hand it was exactly the same thought natásha what is this she cried twanging a 
thick string you are there said sónya with a start and came near and listened 
know a storm she ventured timidly afraid of being wrong just how she started and 
just how she came up smiling timidly when all this happened before thought natásha in 
just the same way i thought there was something lacking in her the chorus from 
the water carrier listen and natásha sang the air of the chorus so that sónya 
should catch it were you going she asked change the water in this glass i 
am just finishing the design always find something to do but i said natásha nicholas 
i think go and wake him said natásha him i want him to come and 
sing she sat awhile wondering what the meaning of it all having happened before could 
be and without solving this problem or at all regretting not having done so she 
again passed in fancy to the time when she was with him and he was 
looking at her with a eyes if only he would come quicker i am so 
afraid it will never be and worst of all i am growing the thing there 
then be in me what there is now but perhaps come today will come immediately 
perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room perhaps he came yesterday 
and i have forgotten it she rose put down the guitar and went to the 
drawing room all the domestic circle tutors governesses and guests were already at the tea 
table the servants stood round the prince andrew was not there and life was going 
on as before here she is said the old count when he saw natásha enter 
sit down by me but natásha stayed by her mother and glanced round as if 
looking for something she muttered him to me give him mamma quickly quickly and she 
again had difficulty in repressing her sobs she sat down at the table and listened 
to the conversation between the elders and nicholas who had also come to the table 
god my god the same faces the same talk papa holding his cup and blowing 
in the same way thought natásha feeling with horror a sense of repulsion rising up 
in her for the whole household because they were always the same after tea nicholas 
sónya and natásha went to the sitting room to their favorite corner where their most 
intimate talks always began chapter x it ever happen to you said natásha to her 
brother when they settled down in the sitting room it ever happen to you to 
feel as if there were nothing more to that everything good is past and to 
feel not exactly dull but sad should think so he replied have felt like that 
when everything was all right and everyone was cheerful the thought has come into my 
mind that i was already tired of it all and that we must all die 
once in the regiment i had not gone to some merrymaking where there was music 
and suddenly i felt so depressed yes i know i know i know natásha interrupted 
him i was quite little that used to be so with me do you remember 
when i was punished once about some plums you were all dancing and i sat 
sobbing in the schoolroom i shall never forget it i felt sad and sorry for 
everyone for myself and for everyone and i was was the chief thing said natásha 
you remember remember answered nicholas remember that i came to you afterwards and wanted to 
comfort you but do you know i felt ashamed to we were terribly absurd i 
had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to you do you remember 
do you remember natásha asked with a pensive smile once long long ago when we 
were quite little uncle called us into the was in the old it was went 
in and suddenly there stood negro chimed in nicholas with a smile of delight course 
i remember even now i know whether there really was a negro or if we 
only dreamed it or were told about him was gray you remember and had white 
teeth and stood and looked at us do you remember asked nicholas yes i do 
remember something too sónya answered timidly know i have asked papa and mamma about that 
negro said natásha they say there was no negro at all but you see you 
remember course i do i remember his teeth as if i had just seen them 
strange it is as if it were a dream i like that do you remember 
how we rolled hard boiled eggs in the ballroom and suddenly two old women began 
spinning round on the carpet was that real or not do you remember what fun 
it was and you remember how papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in 
the porch so they went through their memories smiling with pleasure not the sad memories 
of old age but poetic youthful impressions of most distant past in which dreams and 
realities they laughed with quiet enjoyment sónya as always did not quite keep pace with 
them though they shared the same reminiscences much that they remembered had slipped from her 
mind and what she recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced 
she simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it she only really 
took part when they recalled first arrival she told them how afraid she had been 
of nicholas because he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her 
that she too would be sewn up with cords i remember their telling me that 
you had been born under a cabbage said natásha i remember that i dared not 
disbelieve it then but knew that it was not true and i felt so uncomfortable 
while they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of 
the sitting room have brought the cock miss she said in a whisper wanted pólya 
tell them to take it away replied natásha in the middle of their talk in 
the sitting room dimmler came in and went up to the harp that stood there 
in a corner he took off its cloth covering and the harp gave out a 
jarring sound dimmler please play my favorite nocturne by field came the old voice from 
the drawing room dimmler struck a chord and turning to natásha nicholas and sónya remarked 
quiet you young people are philosophizing said natásha glancing round for a moment and then 
continuing the conversation they were now discussing dreams dimmler began to play natásha went on 
tiptoe noiselessly to the table took up a candle carried it out and returned seating 
herself quietly in her former place it was dark in the room especially where they 
were sitting on the sofa but through the big windows the silvery light of the 
full moon fell on the floor dimmler had finished the piece but still sat softly 
running his fingers over the strings evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play something 
else you know said natásha in a whisper moving closer to nicholas and sónya when 
one goes on and on recalling memories one at last begins to remember what happened 
before one was in the world is metempsychosis said sónya who had always learned well 
and remembered everything egyptians believed that our souls have lived in animals and will go 
back into animals again i believe we ever were in animals said natásha still in 
a whisper though the music had ceased i am certain that we were angels somewhere 
there and have been here and that is why we remember i join you said 
dimmler who had come up quietly and he sat down by them we have been 
angels why have we fallen lower said nicholas that be lower who said we were 
lower how do i know what i was before natásha rejoined with conviction soul is 
then if i shall always live i must have lived before lived for a whole 
eternity but it is hard for us to imagine eternity remarked dimmler who had joined 
the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now spoke as quietly and seriously 
as they is it hard to imagine eternity said natásha is now today and it 
will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday and the day before now your 
turn sing me something they heard the countess say are you sitting there like conspirators 
i at all want to replied natásha but all the same she rose none of 
them not even the middle aged dimmler wanted to break off their conversation and quit 
that corner in the sitting room but natásha got up and nicholas sat down at 
the clavichord standing as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place 
where the resonance was best natásha began to sing her favorite song she had said 
she did not want to sing but it was long since she had sung and 
long before she again sang as she did that evening the count from his study 
where he was talking to mítenka heard her and like a schoolboy in a hurry 
to run out to play blundered in his talk while giving orders to the steward 
and at last stopped while mítenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling 
nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with 
her sónya as she listened thought of the immense difference there was between herself and 
her friend and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching 
as her cousin the old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with 
tears in her eyes occasionally shaking her head she thought of natásha and of her 
own youth and of how there was something unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage 
of natásha and prince andrew dimmler who had seated himself beside the countess listened with 
closed eyes countess he said at last a european talent she has nothing to softness 
tenderness and strength how afraid i am for her how afraid i am said the 
countess not realizing to whom she was speaking her maternal instinct told her that natásha 
had too much of something and that because of this she would not be happy 
before natásha had finished singing fourteen year old pétya rushed in delightedly to say that 
some mummers had arrived natásha stopped abruptly she screamed at her brother and running to 
a chair threw herself on it sobbing so violently that she could not stop for 
a long time nothing mamma really nothing only pétya startled me she said trying to 
smile but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked her the mummers some of 
the house serfs dressed up as bears turks innkeepers and and in with them the 
cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety crowded at first timidly into the anteroom 
then hiding behind one another they pushed into the ballroom where shyly at first and 
then more and more merrily and heartily they started singing dancing and playing christmas games 
the countess when she had identified them and laughed at their costumes went into the 
drawing room the count sat in the ballroom smiling radiantly and applauding the players the 
young people had disappeared half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in 
the ballroom an old lady in a hooped was nicholas a turkish girl was pétya 
a clown was dimmler an hussar was natásha and a circassian was sónya with burnt 
cork mustache and eyebrows after the condescending surprise nonrecognition and praise from those who were 
not themselves dressed up the young people decided that their costumes were so good that 
they ought to be shown elsewhere nicholas who as the roads were in splendid condition 
wanted to take them all for a drive in his troyka proposed to take with 
them about a dozen of the serf mummers and drive to why disturb the old 
fellow said the countess you have room to turn round there if you must go 
go to the melyukóva was a widow who with her family and their tutors and 
governesses lived three miles from the rostóvs right my dear chimed in the old count 
thoroughly aroused dress up at once and go with them make pashette open her eyes 
but the countess would not agree to his going he had had a bad leg 
all these last days it was decided that the count must not go but that 
if louisa ivánovna madame schoss would go with them the young ladies might go to 
the sónya generally so timid and shy more urgently than anyone begging louisa ivánovna not 
to refuse costume was the best of all her mustache and eyebrows were extraordinarily becoming 
everyone told her she looked very handsome and she was in a spirited and energetic 
mood unusual with her some inner voice told her that now or never her fate 
would be decided and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person louisa 
ivánovna consented to go and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and 
small bells their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow drove up to the 
porch natásha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passing from one to 
another grew stronger and reached its climax when they all came out into the frost 
and got into the sleighs talking calling to one another laughing and shouting two of 
the troykas were the usual household sleighs the third was the old with a trotter 
from the orlóv stud as shaft horse the fourth was own with a short shaggy 
black shaft horse nicholas in his old dress over which he had belted his hussar 
overcoat stood in the middle of the sleigh reins in hand it was so light 
that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal harness disks and from the 
eyes of the horses who looked round in alarm at the noisy party under the 
shadow of the porch roof natásha sónya madame schoss and two maids got into sleigh 
dimmler his wife and pétya into the old and the rest of the mummers seated 
themselves in the other two sleighs go ahead zakhár shouted nicholas to his coachman wishing 
for a chance to race past him the old troyka with dimmler and his party 
started forward squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow its deep toned 
bell clanging the side horses pressing against the shafts of the middle horse sank in 
the snow which was dry and glittered like sugar and threw it up nicholas set 
off following the first sleigh behind him the others moved noisily their runners squeaking at 
first they drove at a steady trot along the narrow road while they drove past 
the garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid 
the brilliant moonlight but as soon as they were past the fence the snowy plain 
bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with 
bluish shadows bang bang went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow 
of the road and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same way and 
rudely breaking the frost bound stillness the troykas began to speed along the road one 
after the other track a lot of tracks rang out voice through the frost bound 
air light it is nicholas came voice nicholas glanced round at sónya and bent down 
to see her face closer quite a new sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches 
peeped up at him from her sable close and yet so the moonlight used to 
be sónya thought he and looked at her closer and smiled is it nicholas said 
he and turned again to the horses when they came out onto the beaten by 
sleigh runners and cut up by rough shod hoofs the marks of which were visible 
in the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and increased 
their pace the near side horse arching his head and breaking into a short canter 
tugged at his traces the shaft horse swayed from side to side moving his ears 
as if asking it time to begin now in front already far ahead the deep 
bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off the black horses driven by zakhár 
could be clearly seen against the white snow from that sleigh one could hear the 
shouts laughter and voices of the mummers up my darlings shouted nicholas pulling the reins 
to one side and flourishing the whip it was only by the keener wind that 
met them and the jerks given by the side horses who pulled increasing their one 
noticed how fast the troyka was flying nicholas looked back with screams squeals and waving 
of whips that caused even the shaft horses to other sleighs followed the shaft horse 
swung steadily beneath the bow over its head with no thought of slackening pace and 
ready to put on speed when required nicholas overtook the first sleigh they were driving 
downhill and coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow near a river 
are we thought he the kosóy meadow i suppose but is something new never seen 
before this the kosóy meadow nor the dëmkin hill and heaven only knows what it 
is it is something new and enchanted well whatever it may be and shouting to 
his horses he began to pass the first sleigh zakhár held back his horses and 
turned his face which was already covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows nicholas gave the 
horses the rein and zakhár stretching out his arms clucked his tongue and let his 
horses go look out master he cried faster still the two troykas flew side by 
side and faster moved the feet of the galloping side horses nicholas began to draw 
ahead zakhár while still keeping his arms extended raised one hand with the reins you 
master he shouted nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed zakhár the 
horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the them sounded 
quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows 
of the troyka they were passing the whistling sound of the runners on the snow 
and the voices of girls shrieking were heard from different sides again checking his horses 
nicholas looked around him they were still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight 
and spangled with stars is shouting that i should turn to the left but why 
to the left thought nicholas we getting to the is this melyukóvka heaven only knows 
where we are going and heaven knows what is happening to it is very strange 
and pleasant whatever it is and he looked round in the sleigh his mustache and 
eyelashes are all white said one of the strange pretty unfamiliar one with fine eyebrows 
and mustache think this used to be natásha thought nicholas that was madame schoss but 
perhaps not and this circassian with the mustache i know but i love her you 
cold he asked they did not answer but began to laugh dimmler from the sleigh 
behind shouted something they could not make out what he said yes some voices answered 
laughing here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows and a glitter of diamonds 
and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy buildings and the 
shrill yells of some animals and if this is really melyukóvka it is still stranger 
that we drove heaven knows where and have come to melyukóvka thought nicholas it really 
was melyukóvka and maids and footmen with merry faces came running out to the porch 
carrying candles is it asked someone in the porch mummers from the i know by 
the horses replied some voices chapter xi pelagéya danílovna melyukóva a broadly built energetic woman 
wearing spectacles sat in the drawing room in a loose dress surrounded by her daughters 
whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull they were quietly dropping melted wax 
into snow and looking at the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall 
when they heard the steps and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule hussars ladies 
witches clowns and bears after clearing their throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces 
in the vestibule came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted the the a 
dance surrounded by the screaming children the mummers covering their faces and disguising their voices 
bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the room me no recognizing them and 
natásha see whom she looks like she really reminds me of somebody but herr he 
good i know him and how he dances dear me a circassian really how becoming 
it is to dear sónya and who is that well you have cheered us up 
nikíta and away the tables and we were sitting so quietly ha ha ha the 
hussar the hussar just like a boy and the legs i look at him different 
voices were saying natásha the young favorite disappeared with them into the back rooms where 
a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments were called for and received from 
the footman by bare girlish arms from behind the door ten minutes later all the 
young melyukóvs joined the mummers pelagéya danílovna having given orders to clear the rooms for 
the visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs went about among 
the mummers without removing her spectacles peering into their faces with a suppressed smile and 
failing to recognize any of them it was not merely dimmler and the rostóvs she 
failed to recognize she did not even recognize her own daughters or her late dressing 
gowns and uniforms which they had put on who is this she asked her governess 
peering into the face of her own daughter dressed up as a kazán tartar suppose 
it is one of the rostóvs well mr hussar and what regiment do you serve 
in she asked natásha hand some fruit jelly to the turk she ordered the butler 
who was handing things round not forbidden by his law sometimes as she looked at 
the strange but amusing capers cut by the dancers decided once for all that being 
disguised no one would recognize not at all shy pelagéya danílovna hid her face in 
her handkerchief and her whole stout body shook with irrepressible kindly elderly laughter little sásha 
look at sásha she said after russian country dances and chorus dances pelagéya danílovna made 
the serfs and gentry join in one large circle a ring a string and a 
silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together in an hour all the 
costumes were crumpled and disordered the corked eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring 
flushed and merry faces pelagéya danílovna began to recognize the mummers admired their cleverly contrived 
costumes and particularly how they suited the young ladies and she thanked them all for 
having entertained her so well the visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room 
and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom to tell fortune in 
the empty bathhouse is frightening said an old maid who lived with the melyukóvs during 
supper said the eldest melyukóv girl go it takes courage go said sónya what happened 
to the young lady said the second melyukóv girl began the old maid young lady 
once went out took a cock laid the table for two all properly and sat 
down after sitting a while she suddenly hears someone coming a sleigh drives up with 
harness bells she hears him coming he comes in just in the shape of a 
man like an in and sits down to table with her ah screamed natásha rolling 
her eyes with horror and how did he speak like a man everything quite all 
right and he began persuading her and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow 
but she got frightened just got frightened and hid her face in her hands then 
he caught her up it was lucky the maids ran in just then why frighten 
them said pelagéya danílovna you used to try your fate yourself said her daughter how 
does one do it in a barn inquired sónya say you went to the barn 
now and listened it depends on what you hear hammering and bad but a sound 
of shifting grain is good and one sometimes hears that too tell us what happened 
to you in the barn pelagéya danílovna smiled forgotten she replied none of you would 
go i will pelagéya danílovna let me go said sónya why not if not afraid 
ivánovna may i asked sónya whether they were playing the ring and string game or 
the ruble game or talking as now nicholas did not leave side and gazed at 
her with quite new eyes it seemed to him that it was only today thanks 
to that burnt cork mustache that he had fully learned to know her and really 
that evening sónya was brighter more animated and prettier than nicholas had ever seen her 
before what she is like what a fool i have been he thought gazing at 
her sparkling eyes and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile dimpled her cheeks a 
smile he had never seen before not afraid of anything said sónya i go at 
once she got up they told her where the barn was and how she should 
stand and listen and they handed her a fur cloak she threw this over her 
head and shoulders and glanced at nicholas a darling that girl is thought he what 
have i been thinking of till now sónya went out into the passage to go 
to the barn nicholas went hastily to the front porch saying he felt too hot 
the crowd of people really had made the house stuffy outside there was the same 
cold stillness and the same moon but even brighter than before the light was so 
strong and the snow sparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to 
look up at the sky and the real stars were unnoticed the sky was black 
and dreary while the earth was gay am a fool a fool what have i 
been waiting for thought nicholas and running out from the porch he went round the 
corner of the house and along the path that led to the back porch he 
knew sónya would pass that way halfway lay some snow covered piles of firewood and 
across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell 
on the snow and on the path this path led to the barn the log 
walls of the barn and its snow covered roof that looked as if hewn out 
of some precious stone sparkled in the moonlight a tree in the garden snapped with 
the frost and then all was again perfectly silent his bosom seemed to inhale not 
air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness from the back porch came the 
sound of feet descending the steps the bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave 
a ringing creak and he heard the voice of an old maidservant saying straight along 
the path miss only look back am not afraid answered voice and along the path 
toward nicholas came the crunching whistling sound of feet in her thin shoes sónya came 
along wrapped in her cloak she was only a couple of paces away when she 
saw him and to her too he was not the nicholas she had known and 
always slightly feared he was in a dress with tousled hair and a happy smile 
new to sónya she ran rapidly toward him different and yet the same thought nicholas 
looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight he slipped his arms under 
the cloak that covered her head embraced her pressed her to him and kissed her 
on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork sónya 
kissed him full on the lips and disengaging her little hands pressed them to his 
cheeks nicholas was all they said they ran to the barn and then back again 
re entering he by the front and she by the back porch chapter xii when 
they all drove back from pelagéya natásha who always saw and noticed everything arranged that 
she and madame schoss should go back in the sleigh with dimmler and sónya with 
nicholas and the maids on the way back nicholas drove at a steady pace instead 
of racing and kept peering by that fantastic all transforming light into face and searching 
beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his present sónya from whom he 
had resolved never to be parted again he looked and recognizing in her both the 
old and the new sónya and being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of 
the sensation of her kiss inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and looking 
at the ground flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky felt himself again in 
fairyland is it well with thee he asked from time to time she replied with 
thee when halfway home nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for a 
moment to sleigh and stood on its wing he whispered in french you know i 
have made up my mind about sónya you told her asked natásha suddenly beaming all 
over with joy how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows you glad 
am so glad so glad i was beginning to be vexed with you i did 
not tell you but you have been treating her badly what a heart she has 
nicholas i am horrid sometimes but i was ashamed to be happy while sónya was 
not continued natásha i am so glad well run back to her wait a bit 
oh how funny you look cried nicholas peering into her face and finding in his 
sister too something new unusual and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her 
before magical it she replied have done splendidly i seen her before as she is 
now thought nicholas should long ago have asked her what to do and have done 
whatever she told me and all would have been well you are glad and i 
have done right quite right i had a quarrel with mamma some time ago about 
it mamma said she was angling for you how could she say such a thing 
i nearly stormed at mamma i will never let anyone say anything bad of sónya 
for there is nothing but good in her all right said nicholas again scrutinizing the 
expression of his face to see if she was in earnest then he jumped down 
and his boots scrunching the snow ran back to his sleigh the same happy smiling 
circassian with mustache and beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood was still 
sitting there and that circassian was sónya and that sónya was certainly his future happy 
and loving wife when they reached home and had told their mother how they had 
spent the evening at the the girls went to their bedroom when they had undressed 
but without washing off the cork mustaches they sat a long time talking of their 
happiness they talked of how they would live when they were married how their husbands 
would be friends and how happy they would be on table stood two looking glasses 
which dunyásha had prepared beforehand when will all that be i am afraid never it 
would be too good said natásha rising and going to the looking glasses down natásha 
perhaps see him said sónya natásha lit the candles one on each side of one 
of the looking glasses and sat down see someone with a mustache said natásha seeing 
her own face laugh miss said dunyásha with help and the natásha got the glass 
she held into the right position opposite the other her face assumed a serious expression 
and she sat silent she sat a long time looking at the receding line of 
candles reflected in the glasses and expecting from tales she had heard to see a 
coffin or him prince andrew in that last dim indistinctly outlined square but ready as 
she was to take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of 
a coffin she saw nothing she began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking 
glasses is it others see things and i she said sit down now sónya you 
absolutely must tonight do it for me today i feel so frightened sónya sat down 
before the glasses got the right position and began looking miss sónya is sure to 
see something whispered dunyásha you do nothing but laugh sónya heard this and whisper know 
she will she saw something last year for about three minutes all were silent course 
she will whispered natásha but did not finish suddenly sónya pushed away the glass she 
was holding and covered her eyes with her hand natásha she cried you see did 
you what was it exclaimed natásha holding up the looking glass sónya had not seen 
anything she was just wanting to blink and to get up when she heard natásha 
say course she will she did not wish to disappoint either dunyásha or natásha but 
it was hard to sit still she did not herself know how or why the 
exclamation escaped her when she covered her eyes saw him urged natásha seizing her hand 
wait a bit i saw him sónya could not help saying not yet knowing whom 
natásha meant by him nicholas or prince andrew why i say i saw something others 
do see besides who can tell whether i saw anything or not flashed through mind 
i saw him she said standing or lying i saw at first there was nothing 
then i saw him lying down lying is he ill asked natásha her frightened eyes 
fixed on her friend on the contrary on the contrary his face was cheerful and 
he turned to me and when saying this she herself fancied she had really seen 
what she described and then sónya that i could not make out what there was 
something blue and red when will he come back when shall i see him o 
god how afraid i am for him and for myself and about everything natásha began 
and without replying to words of comfort she got into bed and long after her 
candle was out lay open eyed and motionless gazing at the moonlight through the frosty 
windowpanes chapter xiii soon after the christmas holidays nicholas told his mother of his love 
for sónya and of his firm resolve to marry her the countess who had long 
noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this declaration listened to him 
in silence and then told her son that he might marry whom he pleased but 
that neither she nor his father would give their blessing to such a marriage nicholas 
for the first time felt that his mother was displeased with him and that despite 
her love for him she would not give way coldly without looking at her son 
she sent for her husband and when he came tried briefly and coldly to inform 
him of the facts in her presence but unable to restrain herself she burst into 
tears of vexation and left the room the old count began irresolutely to admonish nicholas 
and beg him to abandon his purpose nicholas replied that he could not go back 
on his word and his father sighing and evidently disconcerted very soon became silent and 
went in to the countess in all his encounters with his son the count was 
always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune and 
so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry an heiress and 
choosing the dowerless sónya on this occasion he was only more vividly conscious of the 
fact that if his affairs had not been in disorder no better wife for nicholas 
than sónya could have been wished for and that no one but himself with his 
mítenka and his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family finances 
the father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again but 
a few days later the countess sent for sónya and with a cruelty neither of 
them expected reproached her niece for trying to catch nicholas and for ingratitude sónya listened 
silently with downcast eyes to the cruel words without understanding what was required of her 
she was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors self sacrifice was her most cherished 
idea but in this case she could not see what she ought to sacrifice or 
for whom she could not help loving the countess and the whole rostóv family but 
neither could she help loving nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love 
she was silent and sad and did not reply nicholas felt the situation to be 
intolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother he first implored her to 
forgive him and sónya and consent to their marriage then he threatened that if she 
molested sónya he would at once marry her secretly the countess with a coldness her 
son had never seen in her before replied that he was of age that prince 
andrew was marrying without his consent and he could do the same but that she 
would never receive that intriguer as her daughter exploding at the word intriguer nicholas raising 
his voice told his mother he had never expected her to try to force him 
to sell his feelings but if that were so he would say for the last 
time but he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of 
his face caused his mother to await with terror and which would perhaps have forever 
remained a cruel memory to them both he had not time to say it for 
natásha with a pale and set face entered the room from the door at which 
she had been listening you are talking nonsense be quiet be quiet be quiet i 
tell you she almost screamed so as to drown his voice darling not at all 
so my poor sweet darling she said to her mother who conscious that they had 
been on the brink of a rupture gazed at her son with terror but in 
the obstinacy and excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way explain 
to you go away listen mamma darling said natásha her words were incoherent but they 
attained the purpose at which she was aiming the countess sobbing heavily hid her face 
on her breast while nicholas rose clutching his head and left the room natásha set 
to work to effect a reconciliation and so far succeeded that nicholas received a promise 
from his mother that sónya should not be troubled while he on his side promised 
not to undertake anything without his knowledge firmly resolved after putting his affairs in order 
in the regiment to retire from the army and return and marry sónya nicholas serious 
sorrowful and at variance with his parents but as it seemed to him passionately in 
love left at the beginning of january to rejoin his regiment after nicholas had gone 
things in the rostóv household were more depressing than ever and the countess fell ill 
from mental agitation sónya was unhappy at the separation from nicholas and still more so 
on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward her the 
count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his affairs which called for 
some decisive action their town house and estate near moscow had inevitably to be sold 
and for this they had to go to moscow but the health obliged them to 
delay their departure from day to day natásha who had borne the first period of 
separation from her betrothed lightly and even cheerfully now grew more agitated and impatient every 
day the thought that her best days which she would have employed in loving him 
were being vainly wasted with no advantage to anyone tormented her incessantly his letters for 
the most part irritated her it hurt her to think that while she lived only 
in the thought of him he was living a real life seeing new places and 
new people that interested him the more interesting his letters were the more vexed she 
felt her letters to him far from giving her any comfort seemed to her a 
wearisome and artificial obligation she could not write because she could not conceive the possibility 
of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by 
voice smile and glance she wrote to him formal monotonous and dry letters to which 
she attached no importance herself and in the rough copies of which the countess corrected 
her mistakes in spelling there was still no improvement in the health but it was 
impossible to defer the journey to moscow any longer trousseau had to be ordered and 
the house sold moreover prince andrew was expected in moscow where old prince bolkónski was 
spending the winter and natásha felt sure he had already arrived so the countess remained 
in the country and the count taking sónya and natásha with him went to moscow 
at the end of january book eight 1811 12 chapter i after prince engagement to 
natásha pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as 
before firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor 
and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man to which he had 
devoted himself with such the zest of such a life vanished after the engagement of 
andrew and natásha and the death of joseph alexéevich the news of which reached him 
almost at the same time only the skeleton of life remained his house a brilliant 
wife who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance with all petersburg 
and his court service with its dull formalities and this life suddenly seemed to pierre 
unexpectedly loathsome he ceased keeping a diary avoided the company of the brothers began going 
to the club again drank a great deal and came once more in touch with 
the bachelor sets leading such a life that the countess hélène thought it necessary to 
speak severely to him about it pierre felt that she was right and to avoid 
compromising her went away to moscow in moscow as soon as he entered his huge 
house in which the faded and fading princesses still lived with its enormous retinue as 
soon as driving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning 
before the golden covers of the icons the krémlin square with its snow undisturbed by 
vehicles the sleigh drivers and hovels of the sívtsev vrazhók those old moscovites who desired 
nothing hurried nowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he saw those old moscow 
ladies the moscow balls and the english club he felt himself at home in a 
quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace at home warm and dirty as in 
an old dressing gown moscow society from the old women down to the children received 
pierre like a long expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him for moscow 
society pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectual merriest and most magnanimous of cranks a 
heedless genial nobleman of the old russian type his purse was always empty because it 
was open to everyone benefit performances poor pictures statues benevolent societies gypsy choirs schools subscription 
dinners sprees freemasons churches and one and nothing met with a refusal from him and 
had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and 
taken him under their protection he would have given everything away there was never a 
dinner or soiree at the club without him as soon as he sank into his 
place on the sofa after two bottles of margaux he was surrounded and talking disputing 
and joking began when there were quarrels his kindly smile and well timed jests reconciled 
the antagonists the masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there when 
after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile yielding to the 
entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere with them shouts of delight and 
triumph arose among the young men at balls he danced if a partner was needed 
young ladies married and unmarried liked him because without making love to any of them 
he was equally amiable to all especially after supper est charmant il pas de sexe 
they said of him is charming he has no sex pierre was one of those 
retired gentlemen in waiting of whom there were hundreds good humoredly ending their days in 
moscow how horrified he would have been seven years before when he first arrived from 
abroad had he been told that there was no need for him to seek or 
plan anything that his rut had long been shaped eternally predetermined and that wriggle as 
he might he would be what all in his position were he could not have 
believed it had he not at one time longed with all his heart to establish 
a republic in russia then himself to be a napoleon then to be a philosopher 
and then a strategist and the conqueror of napoleon had he not seen the possibility 
of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinful human race and his own progress 
to the highest degree of perfection had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated 
his serfs but instead of all he was the wealthy husband of an unfaithful wife 
a retired gentleman in waiting fond of eating and drinking and as he unbuttoned his 
waistcoat of abusing the government a bit a member of the moscow english club and 
a universal favorite in moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself 
to the idea that he was one of those same retired moscow gentlemen in waiting 
he had so despised seven years before sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that 
he was only living this life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought 
of how many like himself had entered that life and that club temporarily with all 
their teeth and hair and had only left it when not a single tooth or 
hair remained in moments of pride when he thought of his position it seemed to 
him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired gentlemen in waiting 
he had formerly despised they were empty stupid contented fellows satisfied with their position i 
am still discontented and want to do something for mankind but perhaps all these comrades 
of mine struggled just like me and sought something new a path in life of 
their own and like me were brought by force of circumstances society and that elemental 
force against which man is the condition i am in said he to himself in 
moments of humility and after living some time in moscow he no longer despised but 
began to grow fond of to respect and to pity his comrades in destiny as 
he pitied himself pierre no longer suffered moments of despair hypochondria and disgust with life 
but the malady that had formerly found expression in such acute attacks was driven inwards 
and never left him for a moment for why what is going on in the 
world he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to reflect 
anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life but knowing by experience that there 
were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away from them and 
took up a book or hurried off to the club or to apollón to exchange 
the gossip of the town who has never cared for anything but her own body 
and is one of the stupidest women in the world thought pierre regarded by people 
as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they pay homage to her napoleon bonaparte 
was despised by all as long as he was great but now that he has 
become a wretched comedian the emperor francis wants to offer him his daughter in an 
illegal marriage the spaniards through the catholic clergy offer praise to god for their victory 
over the french on the fourteenth of june and the french also through the catholic 
clergy offer praise because on that same fourteenth of june they defeated the spaniards my 
brother masons swear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their 
neighbor but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor 
and they intrigue the astraea lodge against the manna seekers and fuss about an authentic 
scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs and the meaning of which the very 
man who wrote it does not understand we all profess the christian law of forgiveness 
of injuries and love of our neighbors the law in honor of which we have 
built in moscow forty times forty yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a 
minister of that same law of love and forgiveness a priest gave the soldier a 
cross to kiss before his execution so thought pierre and the whole of this general 
deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was to it astonished him each time as 
if it were something new understand the deception and confusion he thought how am i 
to tell them all that i see i have tried and have always found that 
they too in the depths of their souls understand it as i do and only 
try not to see it so it appears that it must be so but is 
to become of me thought he he had the unfortunate capacity many men especially russians 
have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth but of seeing 
the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious 
part in it every sphere of work was connected in his eyes with evil and 
deception whatever he tried to be whatever he engaged in the evil and falsehood of 
it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity yet he had to live and 
to find occupation it was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble 
problems so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them he frequented 
every kind of society drank much bought pictures engaged in building and above he read 
and read everything that came to hand on coming home while his valets were still 
taking off his things he picked up a book and began to read from reading 
he passed to sleeping from sleeping to gossip in drawing rooms of the club from 
gossip to carousals and women from carousals back to gossip reading and wine drinking became 
more and more a physical and also a moral necessity though the doctors warned him 
that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him he drank a great deal he 
was only quite at ease when having poured several glasses of wine mechanically into his 
large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in his body an amiability toward all his 
fellows and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it deeply only 
after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein 
of life which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought 
he was always conscious of some aspect of that skein as with a buzzing in 
his head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read but 
under the influence of wine he said to himself matter get it unraveled i have 
a solution ready but have no time think it all out later on but the 
later on never came in the morning on an empty stomach all the old questions 
appeared as insoluble and terrible as ever and pierre hastily picked up a book and 
if anyone came to see him he was glad sometimes he remembered how he had 
heard that soldiers in war when entrenched under the fire if they have nothing to 
do try hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger to 
pierre all men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life some in ambition some 
in cards some in framing laws some in women some in toys some in horses 
some in politics some in sport some in wine and some in governmental affairs is 
trivial and nothing is important all the to save oneself from it as best one 
can thought pierre not to see it that dreadful it chapter ii at the beginning 
of winter prince nicholas bolkónski and his daughter moved to moscow at that time enthusiasm 
for the emperor regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti french tendency prevailed there 
and this together with his past and his intellect and his originality at once made 
prince nicholas bolkónski an object of particular respect to the moscovites and the center of 
the moscow opposition to the government the prince had aged very much that year he 
showed marked signs of senility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recent 
events remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with which he accepted the role 
of head of the moscow opposition in spite of this the old man inspired in 
all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful of an evening when he came in 
to tea in his old fashioned coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told 
his abrupt stories of the past or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms of 
the present for them all that old fashioned house with its gigantic mirrors pre revolution 
furniture powdered footmen and the stern shrewd old man himself a relic of the past 
century with his gentle daughter and the pretty frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him 
presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle but the visitors did not reflect that besides the 
couple of hours during which they saw their host there were also twenty two hours 
in the day during which the private and intimate life of the house continued latterly 
that private life had become very trying for princess mary there in moscow she was 
deprived of her greatest with the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at bald 
she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not go 
out into society everyone knew that her father would not let her go anywhere without 
him and his failing health prevented his going out himself so that she was not 
invited to dinners and evening parties she had quite abandoned the hope of getting married 
she saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the 
young men possible suitors who sometimes appeared at their house she had no friends during 
this visit to moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest 
to her mademoiselle bourienne with whom she had never been able to be quite frank 
had now become unpleasant to her and for various reasons princess mary avoided her julie 
with whom she had corresponded for the last five years was in moscow but proved 
to be quite alien to her when they met just then julie who by the 
death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscow was in 
the full whirl of society pleasures she was surrounded by young men who she fancied 
had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth julie was at that stage in the life 
of a society woman when she feels that her last chance of marrying has come 
and that her fate must be decided now or never on thursdays princess mary remembered 
with a mournful smile that she now had no one to write to since presence 
gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week like the old émigré 
who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his evenings for years 
she regretted presence and having no one to write to in moscow princess mary had 
no one to talk to no one to whom to confide her sorrow and much 
sorrow fell to her lot just then the time for prince return and marriage was 
approaching but his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been 
carried out in fact it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless for at every 
mention of the young countess rostóva the old prince who apart from that was usually 
in a bad temper lost control of himself another lately added sorrow arose from the 
lessons she gave her six year old nephew to her consternation she detected in herself 
in relation to little nicholas some symptoms of her irritability however often she told herself 
that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew almost every time that pointer 
in hand she sat down to show him the french alphabet she so longed to 
pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the was already afraid that auntie might 
at any moment get at his slightest inattention she trembled became flustered and heated raised 
her voice and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner 
having put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel 
evil nature and little nicholas following her example would sob and without permission would leave 
his corner come to her pull her wet hands from her face and comfort her 
but what distressed the princess most of all was her irritability which was always directed 
against her and had of late amounted to cruelty had he forced her to prostrate 
herself to the ground all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood 
or water it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard but 
this loving more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and 
how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately but to show her that she 
was always to blame for everything of late he had exhibited a new trait that 
tormented princess mary more than anything else this was his ever increasing intimacy with mademoiselle 
bourienne the idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his intentions 
had occurred to him in if andrew got married he himself would marry evidently pleased 
him and latterly he had persistently and as it seemed to princess mary merely to 
offend her shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter 
by demonstrations of love of bourienne one day in moscow in princess presence she thought 
her father did it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed mademoiselle hand 
and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately princess mary flushed and ran out of 
the room a few minutes later mademoiselle bourienne came into princess room smiling and making 
cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess mary hastily wiped away her tears went resolutely 
up to mademoiselle bourienne and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in 
angry haste at the frenchwoman her voice breaking horrible vile inhuman to take advantage of 
the weakness she did not finish my room she exclaimed and burst into sobs next 
day the prince did not say a word to his daughter but she noticed that 
at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should be served first after dinner when 
the footman handed coffee and from habit began with the princess the prince suddenly grew 
furious threw his stick at philip and instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for 
the army obey i said it twice and he obey she is the first person 
in this house my best friend cried the prince if you allow yourself he screamed 
in a fury addressing princess mary for the first time forget yourself again before her 
as you dared to do yesterday i will show you who is master in this 
house go let me set eyes on you beg her pardon princess mary asked mademoiselle 
pardon and also her pardon for herself and for philip the footman who had begged 
for her intervention at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her 
soul and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his spectacles in 
her presence fumbling near them and not seeing them or would forget something that had 
just occurred or take a false step with his failing legs and turn to see 
if anyone had noticed his feebleness or worst of all at dinner when there were 
no visitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep letting his napkin drop and his 
shaking head sink over his plate is old and feeble and i dare to condemn 
him she thought at such moments with a feeling of revulsion against herself chapter iii 
in 1811 there was living in moscow a french had rapidly become the fashion he 
was enormously tall handsome amiable as frenchmen are and was as all moscow said an 
extraordinarily clever doctor he was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor 
but as an equal prince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine but latterly on mademoiselle advice 
had allowed this doctor to visit him and had grown accustomed to him métivier came 
to see the prince about twice a week on december day and the name moscow 
came to the front door but he gave orders to admit no one and to 
invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom he gave to princess 
mary métivier who came in the morning with his felicitations considered it proper in his 
quality of doctor de forcer la consigne as he told princess mary and went in 
to see the prince it happened that on that morning of his name day the 
prince was in one of his worst moods he had been going about the house 
all the morning finding fault with everyone and pretending not to understand what was said 
to him and not to be understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of 
quiet absorbed querulousness which generally culminated in a burst of rage and she went about 
all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable 
explosion until the arrival the morning had passed off safely after admitting the doctor princess 
mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which 
she could hear all that passed in the study to force the guard at first 
she heard only voice then her then both voices began speaking at the same time 
the door was flung open and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the 
terrified métivier with his shock of black hair and the prince in his dressing gown 
and fez his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards 
understand shouted the prince i do french spy slave of buonaparte spy get out of 
my house be off i tell you and he slammed the door métivier shrugging his 
shoulders went up to mademoiselle bourienne who at the sound of shouting had run in 
from an adjoining room prince is not very well bile and rush of blood to 
the head keep calm i will call again tomorrow said métivier and putting his fingers 
to his lips he hastened away through the study door came the sound of slippered 
feet and the cry traitors traitors everywhere not a peace in my own house after 
departure the old prince called his daughter in and the whole weight of his wrath 
fell on her she was to blame that a spy had been admitted had he 
not told her yes told her to make a list and not to admit anyone 
who was not on that list then why was that scoundrel admitted she was the 
cause of it all with her he said he could not have a peace and 
could not die quietly we must part we must part understand that understand it i 
cannot endure any more he said and left the room then as if afraid she 
might find some means of consolation he returned and trying to appear calm added imagine 
i have said this in a moment of anger i am calm i have thought 
it over and it will be carried must part so find some place for yourself 
but he could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who 
loves is capable evidently suffering himself he shook his fists at her and screamed only 
some fool would marry her then he slammed the door sent for mademoiselle bourienne and 
subsided into his study at two the six chosen guests assembled for dinner these famous 
count rostopchín prince lopukhín with his nephew general chatróv an old war comrade of the 
and of the younger generation pierre and borís the prince in the drawing room borís 
who had come to moscow on leave a few days before had been anxious to 
be presented to prince nicholas bolkónski and had contrived to ingratiate himself so well that 
the old prince in his case made an exception to the rule of not receiving 
bachelors in his house the house did not belong to what is known as fashionable 
society but his little not much talked about in one it was more flattering to 
be received in than any other borís had realized this the week before when the 
commander in chief in his presence invited rostopchín to dinner on st day and rostopchín 
had replied that he could not come that day i always go to pay my 
devotions to the relics of prince nicholas bolkónski yes yes replied the commander in chief 
is he the small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old fashioned drawing 
room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a court of justice all 
were silent or talked in low tones prince nicholas came in serious and taciturn princess 
mary seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual the guests were reluctant to address 
her feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation count rostopchín alone kept 
the conversation going now relating the latest town news and now the latest political gossip 
lopukhín and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation prince bolkónski listened as 
a presiding judge receives a report only now and then silently or by a brief 
word showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him the tone 
of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was being 
done in the political world incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that everything was 
going from bad to worse but whether telling a story or giving an opinion the 
speaker always stopped or was stopped at the point beyond which his criticism might touch 
the sovereign himself at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news seizure of 
the duke of territory and the russian note hostile to napoleon which had been sent 
to all the european courts treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said 
count rostopchín repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before only wonders at the 
long suffering or blindness of the crowned heads now the turn has come and bonaparte 
scruple to depose the head of the catholic all keep silent our sovereign alone has 
protested against the seizure of the duke of territory and even count rostopchín paused feeling 
that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was impossible territories have been offered 
in exchange for the duchy of oldenburg said prince bolkónski shifts the dukes about as 
i might move my serfs from bald hills to boguchárovo or my ryazán estates duke 
of oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of character and resignation remarked borís joining 
in respectfully he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the 
honor of being presented to the duke prince bolkónski glanced at the young man as 
if about to say something in reply but changed his mind evidently considering him too 
young have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was surprised how badly the 
note was worded remarked count rostopchín in the casual tone of a man dealing with 
a subject quite familiar to him pierre looked at rostopchín with naïve astonishment not understanding 
why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the note it matter count 
how the note is worded he asked long as its substance is forcible dear fellow 
with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy to have a good style 
returned count rostopchín pierre now understood the dissatisfaction with the wording of the note would 
have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up remarked the old prince in petersburg they 
are always notes only but even new laws my andrew there has written a whole 
volume of laws for russia nowadays they are always writing and he laughed unnaturally there 
was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general cleared his throat to draw 
attention you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg the figure cut 
by the new french ambassador yes i heard something he said something awkward in his 
presence majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the march past continued the 
general it seems the ambassador took no notice and allowed himself to reply that in 
france pay no attention to such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply at 
the next review they say the emperor did not once deign to address him all 
were silent on this fact relating to the emperor personally it was impossible to pass 
any judgment fellows said the prince know métivier i turned him out of my house 
this morning he was here they admitted him in spite of my request that they 
should let no one in he went on glancing angrily at his daughter and he 
narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and the reasons that convinced him that 
métivier was a spy though these reasons were very insufficient and obscure no one made 
any rejoinder after the roast champagne was served the guests rose to congratulate the old 
prince princess mary too went round to him he gave her a cold angry look 
and offered her his wrinkled clean shaven cheek to kiss the whole expression of his 
face told her that he had not forgotten the talk that his decision remained in 
force and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to her now 
when they went into the drawing room where coffee was served the old men sat 
together prince nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the impending war he 
said that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we sought alliances 
with the germans and thrust ourselves into european affairs into which we had been drawn 
by the peace of tilsit ought not to fight either for or against austria our 
political interests are all in the east and in regard to bonaparte the only thing 
is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy and he will never dare 
to cross the russian frontier as was the case in 1807 can we fight the 
french prince said count rostopchín we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities look at 
our youths look at our ladies the french are our gods paris is our kingdom 
of heaven he began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyone dresses french ideas 
french feelings there now you turned métivier out by the scruff of his neck because 
he is a frenchman and a scoundrel but our ladies crawl after him on their 
knees i went to a party last night and there out of five ladies three 
were roman catholics and had the indulgence for doing woolwork on sundays and they themselves 
sit there nearly naked like the signboards at our public baths if i may say 
so ah when one looks at our young people prince one would like to take 
peter the old cudgel out of the museum and belabor them in the russian way 
till all the nonsense jumps out of them all were silent the old prince looked 
at rostopchín with a smile and wagged his head approvingly good by your excellency keep 
well said rostopchín getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the 
prince by my dear fellow his words are music i never tire of hearing him 
said the old prince keeping hold of the hand and offering his cheek to be 
kissed following example the others also rose chapter iv princess mary as she sat listening 
to the old talk and faultfinding understood nothing of what she heard she only wondered 
whether the guests had all observed her hostile attitude toward her she did not even 
notice the special attentions and amiabilities shown her during dinner by borís drubetskóy who was 
visiting them for the third time already princess mary turned with absent minded questioning look 
to pierre who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the 
last of the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and 
they were left alone in the drawing room i stay a little longer he said 
letting his stout body sink into an armchair beside her yes she answered noticed nothing 
her look asked pierre was in an agreeable after dinner mood he looked straight before 
him and smiled quietly you known that young man long princess he asked not long 
you like him he is an agreeable young man why do you ask me that 
said princess mary still thinking of that conversation with her father i have noticed that 
when a young man comes on leave from petersburg to moscow it is usually with 
the object of marrying an heiress have observed that said princess mary returned pierre with 
a smile this young man now manages matters so that where there is a wealthy 
heiress there he is too i can read him like a book at present he 
is hesitating whom to lay siege or mademoiselle julie karágina he is very attentive to 
her visits them very often and do you know the new way of courting said 
pierre with an amused smile evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored raillery for 
which he so often reproached himself in his diary replied princess mary please moscow girls 
nowadays one has to be melancholy he is very melancholy with mademoiselle karágina said pierre 
asked princess mary looking into kindly face and still thinking of her own sorrow would 
be a relief thought she i ventured to confide what i am feeling to someone 
i should like to tell everything to pierre he is kind and generous it would 
be a relief he would give me advice you marry him my god count there 
are moments when i would marry anybody she cried suddenly to her own surprise and 
with tears in her voice how bitter it is to love someone near to you 
and to feel that she went on in a trembling voice you can do nothing 
for him but grieve him and to know that you cannot alter this then there 
is only one thing go away but where could i go is wrong what is 
it princess but without finishing what she was saying princess mary burst into tears know 
what is the matter with me today take any what i have said gaiety vanished 
completely he anxiously questioned the princess asked her to speak out fully and confide her 
grief to him but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she 
had said that she did not remember what she had said and that she had 
no trouble except the one he knew prince marriage threatened to cause a rupture between 
father and son you any news of the rostóvs she asked to change the subject 
was told they are coming soon i am also expecting andrew any day i should 
like them to meet here how does he now regard the matter asked pierre referring 
to the old prince princess mary shook her head is to be done in a 
few months the year will be up the thing is impossible i only wish i 
could spare my brother the first moments i wish they would come sooner i hope 
to be friends with her you have known them a long time said princess mary 
me honestly the whole truth what sort of girl is she and what do you 
think of her real truth because you know andrew is risking so much doing this 
against his will that i should like to know an undefined instinct told pierre that 
these explanations and repeated requests to be told the whole truth expressed ill will on 
the part toward her future sister in law and a wish that he should disapprove 
of choice but in reply he said what he felt rather than what he thought 
know how to answer your question he said blushing without knowing why really know what 
sort of girl she is i analyze her at all she is enchanting but what 
makes her so i know that is all one can say about her princess mary 
sighed and the expression on her face said what i expected and feared she clever 
she asked pierre considered think not he said she does not deign to be clever 
oh no she is simply enchanting and that is all princess mary again shook her 
head disapprovingly i so long to like her tell her so if you see her 
before i do hear they are expected very soon said pierre princess mary told pierre 
of her plan to become intimate with her future sister in law as soon as 
the rostóvs arrived and to try to accustom the old prince to her chapter v 
borís had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg so with the same 
object in view he came to moscow there he wavered between the two richest heiresses 
julie and princess mary though princess mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive 
than julie he without knowing why felt awkward about paying court to her when they 
had last met on the old name day she had answered at random all his 
attempts to talk sentimentally evidently not listening to what he was saying julie on the 
contrary accepted his attentions readily though in a manner peculiar to herself she was twenty 
seven after the death of her brothers she had become very wealthy she was by 
now decidedly plain but thought herself not merely as good looking as before but even 
far more attractive she was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had 
become a very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew 
the less dangerous she became to men and the more freely they could associate with 
her and avail themselves of her suppers soirees and the animated company that assembled at 
her house without incurring any obligation a man who would have been afraid ten years 
before of going every day to the house when there was a girl of seventeen 
there for fear of compromising her and committing himself would now go boldly every day 
and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance that winter 
the house was the most agreeable and hospitable in moscow in addition to the formal 
evening and dinner parties a large company chiefly of men gathered there every day supping 
at midnight and staying till three in the morning julie never missed a ball a 
promenade or a play her dresses were always of the latest fashion but in spite 
of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did 
not believe either in friendship or in love or any of the joys of life 
and expected peace only she adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great 
disappointment like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly 
deceived by him though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded 
in that light and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered much 
in life this melancholy which did not prevent her amusing herself did not hinder the 
young people who came to her house from passing the time pleasantly every visitor who 
came to the house paid his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess and 
then amused himself with society gossip dancing intellectual games and bouts rimés which were in 
vogue at the only a few of these young men among them borís entered more 
deeply into melancholy and with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity 
of all worldly things and to them she showed her albums filled with mournful sketches 
maxims and verses to borís julie was particularly gracious she regretted his early disillusionment with 
life offered him such consolation of friendship as she who had herself suffered so much 
could render and showed him her album borís sketched two trees in the album and 
wrote trees your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me on another page he 
drew a tomb and wrote la mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille ah 
contre les douleurs il a pas asile death gives relief and death is peaceful ah 
from suffering there is no other refuge julie said this was charming is something so 
enchanting in the smile of melancholy she said to borís repeating word for word a 
passage she had copied from a book is a ray of light in the darkness 
a shade between sadness and despair showing the possibility of consolation in reply borís wrote 
these lines aliment de poison âme trop sensible toi sans qui le bonheur me serait 
impossible tendre mélancholie ah viens me consoler viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite 
et mêle une douceur secrète a ces pleurs que je sens couler poisonous nourishment of 
a too sensitive soul thou without whom happiness would for me be impossible tender melancholy 
ah come to console me come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat and 
mingle a secret sweetness with these tears that i feel to be flowing for borís 
julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp borís read poor liza aloud to her 
and more than once interrupted the reading because of the emotions that choked him meeting 
at large gatherings julie and borís looked on one another as the only souls who 
understood one another in a world of indifferent people anna mikháylovna who often visited the 
karágins while playing cards with the mother made careful inquiries as to dowry she was 
to have two estates in pénza and the nizhegórod forests anna mikháylovna regarded the refined 
sadness that united her son to the wealthy julie with emotion and resignation to the 
divine will are always charming and melancholy my dear julie she said to the daughter 
says his soul finds repose at your house he has suffered so many disappointments and 
is so sensitive said she to the mother my dear i tell you how fond 
i have grown of julie latterly she said to her son who could help loving 
her she is an angelic being ah borís borís paused how i pity her mother 
she went on she showed me her accounts and letters from pénza they have enormous 
estates there and she poor thing has no one to help her and they do 
cheat her so borís smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother he laughed blandly 
at her naïve diplomacy but listened to what she had to say and sometimes questioned 
her carefully about the pénza and nizhegórod estates julie had long been expecting a proposal 
from her melancholy adorer and was ready to accept it but some secret feeling of 
repulsion for her for her passionate desire to get married for her artificiality and a 
feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still restrained borís his leave 
was expiring he spent every day and whole days at the and every day on 
thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose tomorrow but in presence looking 
at her red face and chin nearly always powdered her moist eyes and her expression 
of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married 
bliss borís could not utter the decisive words though in imagination he had long regarded 
himself as the possessor of those pénza and nizhegórod estates and had apportioned the use 
of the income from them julie saw indecision and sometimes the thought occurred to her 
that she was repulsive to him but her feminine self deception immediately supplied her with 
consolation and she told herself that he was only shy from love her melancholy however 
began to turn to irritability and not long before departure she formed a definite plan 
of action just as leave of absence was expiring anatole kurágin made his appearance in 
moscow and of course in the drawing room and julie suddenly abandoning her melancholy became 
cheerful and very attentive to kurágin dear said anna mikháylovna to her son know from 
a reliable source that prince vasíli has sent his son to moscow to get him 
married to julie i am so fond of julie that i should be sorry for 
her what do you think of it my dear the idea of being made a 
fool of and of having thrown away that whole month of arduous melancholy service to 
julie and of seeing all the revenue from the pénza estates which he had already 
mentally apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another and especially 
into the hands of that idiot anatole pained borís he drove to the with the 
firm intention of proposing julie met him in a gay careless manner spoke casually of 
how she had enjoyed ball and asked when he was leaving though borís had come 
intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender he began speaking 
irritably of feminine inconstancy of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy and 
how their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them julie 
was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs variety and the 
same thing over and over again would weary anyone i should advise you borís began 
wishing to sting her but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that 
he might have to leave moscow without having accomplished his aim and have vainly wasted 
his was a thing he never allowed to happen he checked himself in the middle 
of the sentence lowered his eyes to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face 
and said did not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contrary 
he glanced at her to make sure that he might go on her irritability had 
suddenly quite vanished and her anxious imploring eyes were fixed on him with greedy expectation 
can always arrange so as not to see her often thought borís affair has been 
begun and must be finished he blushed hotly raised his eyes to hers and said 
know my feelings for you there was no need to say more face shone with 
triumph and self satisfaction but she forced borís to say all that is said on 
such he loved her and had never loved any other woman more than her she 
knew that for the pénza estates and nizhegórod forests she could demand this and she 
received what she demanded the affianced couple no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom 
and melancholy upon them planned the arrangements of a splendid house in petersburg paid calls 
and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding chapter vi at the end of january old 
count rostóv went to moscow with natásha and sónya the countess was still unwell and 
unable to travel but it was impossible to wait for her recovery prince andrew was 
expected in moscow any day the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near 
moscow had to be sold besides which the opportunity of presenting his future daughter in 
law to old prince bolkónski while he was in moscow could not be missed the 
moscow house had not been heated that winter and as they had come only for 
a short time and the countess was not with them the count decided to stay 
with márya dmítrievna akhrosímova who had long been pressing her hospitality on them late one 
evening the four sleighs drove into márya courtyard in the old konyúsheny street márya dmítrievna 
lived alone she had already married off her daughter and her sons were all in 
the service she held herself as erect told everyone her opinion as candidly loudly and 
bluntly as ever and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to others for any weakness 
passion or possibility of which she did not admit from early in the morning wearing 
a dressing jacket she attended to her household affairs and then she drove out on 
holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on affairs of 
which she never spoke to anyone on ordinary days after dressing she received petitioners of 
various classes of whom there were always some then she had dinner a substantial and 
appetizing meal at which there were always three or four guests after dinner she played 
a game of boston and at night she had the newspapers or a new book 
read to her while she knitted she rarely made an exception and went out to 
pay visits and then only to the most important persons in the town she had 
not yet gone to bed when the rostóvs arrived and the pulley of the hall 
door squeaked from the cold as it let in the rostóvs and their servants márya 
dmítrievna with her spectacles hanging down on her nose and her head flung back stood 
in the hall doorway looking with a stern grim face at the new arrivals one 
might have thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out 
had she not at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants for 
the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings things bring them here she said pointing 
to the portmanteaus and not greeting anyone young there to the left now what are 
you dawdling for she cried to the maids the samovar ready grown plumper and prettier 
she remarked drawing natásha whose cheeks were glowing from the cold to her by the 
hood you are cold now take off your things quick she shouted to the count 
who was going to kiss her hand half frozen sure bring some rum for tea 
bonjour sónya dear she added turning to sónya and indicating by this french greeting her 
slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her when they came in to tea having taken 
off their outdoor things and tidied themselves up after their journey márya dmítrievna kissed them 
all in due order heartily glad you have come and are staying with me it 
was high time she said giving natásha a significant look old man is here and 
his expected any day have to make his acquaintance but speak of that later on 
she added glancing at sónya with a look that showed she did not want to 
speak of it in her presence listen she said to the count do you want 
tomorrow whom will you send for shinshín she crooked one of her fingers sniveling anna 
mikháylovna two here with her son the son is getting married then bezúkhov eh he 
is here too with his wife he ran away from her and she came galloping 
after him he dined with me on wednesday as for she pointed to the take 
them first to the iberian shrine of the mother of god and then drive to 
the super i suppose have everything new judge by me sleeves nowadays are this size 
the other day young princess irína vasílevna came to see me she was an awful 
as if she had put two barrels on her arms you know not a day 
passes now without some new fashion and what have you to do yourself she asked 
the count sternly thing has come on top of another her rags to buy and 
now a purchaser has turned up for the moscow estate and for the house if 
you will be so kind fix a time and go down to the estate just 
for a day and leave my lassies with you right all right be safe with 
me as safe as in chancery take them where they must go scold them a 
bit and pet them a bit said márya dmítrievna touching her goddaughter and favorite natásha 
on the cheek with her large hand next morning márya dmítrievna took the young ladies 
to the iberian shrine of the mother of god and to madame suppert roguet who 
was so afraid of márya dmítrievna that she always let her have costumes at a 
loss merely to get rid of her márya dmítrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau when 
they got home she turned everybody out of the room except natásha and then called 
her pet to her armchair now talk i congratulate you on your betrothed hooked a 
fine fellow i am glad for your sake and known him since he was so 
high she held her hand a couple of feet from the ground natásha blushed happily 
like him and all his family now listen you know that old prince nicholas much 
dislikes his marrying the old crotchety of course prince andrew is not a child and 
can shift without him but not nice to enter a family against a will one 
wants to do it peacefully and lovingly a clever girl and know how to manage 
be kind and use your wits then all will be well natásha remained silent from 
shyness márya dmítrievna supposed but really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her 
love of prince andrew which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs that 
no one could understand it she loved and knew prince andrew he loved her only 
and was to come one of these days and take her she wanted nothing more 
see i have known him a long time and am also fond of mary your 
future sister in law sisters bring up blisters but this one hurt a fly she 
has asked me to bring you two together tomorrow go with your father to see 
her be very nice and affectionate to her younger than she when he comes find 
you already know his sister and father and are liked by them am i right 
or not that be best it will natásha answered reluctantly chapter vii next day by 
márya advice count rostóv took natásha to call on prince nicholas bolkónski the count did 
not set out cheerfully on this visit at heart he felt afraid he well remembered 
the last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the 
enrollment when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to 
an angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of men natásha on the 
other hand having put on her best gown was in the highest spirits help liking 
me she thought always has liked me and i am so willing to do anything 
they wish so ready to be fond of being his of being his there is 
no reason for them not to like me they drove up to the gloomy old 
house on the vozdvízhenka and entered the vestibule the lord have mercy on us said 
the count half in jest half in earnest but natásha noticed that her father was 
flurried on entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and princess 
were at home when they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the servants 
the footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by another in the large 
hall and they whispered to one another then a maidservant ran into the hall and 
hurriedly said something mentioning the princess at last an old cross looking footman came and 
announced to the rostóvs that the prince was not receiving but that the princess begged 
them to walk up the first person who came to meet the visitors was mademoiselle 
bourienne she greeted the father and daughter with special politeness and showed them to the 
room the princess looking excited and nervous her face flushed in patches ran in to 
meet the visitors treading heavily and vainly trying to appear cordial and at ease from 
the first glance princess mary did not like natásha she thought her too fashionably dressed 
frivolously gay and vain she did not at all realize that before having seen her 
future sister in law she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty 
youth and happiness as well as by jealousy of her love for her apart from 
this insuperable antipathy to her princess mary was agitated just then because on the being 
announced the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them that 
princess mary might do so if she chose but they were not to be admitted 
to him she had decided to receive them but feared lest the prince might at 
any moment indulge in some freak as he seemed much upset by the visit my 
dear princess brought you my songstress said the count bowing and looking round uneasily as 
if afraid the old prince might appear am so glad you should get to know 
one another very sorry the prince is still ailing and after a few more commonplace 
remarks he rose allow me to leave my natásha in your hands for a quarter 
of an hour princess drive round to see anna semënovna quite near in the square 
and then come back for her the count had devised this diplomatic ruse as he 
afterwards told his daughter to give the future sisters in law an opportunity to talk 
to one another freely but another motive was to avoid the danger of encountering the 
old prince of whom he was afraid he did not mention this to his daughter 
but natásha noticed her nervousness and anxiety and felt mortified by it she blushed for 
him grew still angrier at having blushed and looked at the princess with a bold 
and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody the princess told 
the count that she would be delighted and only begged him to stay longer at 
anna and he departed despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess wished to 
have a tête à tête with bourienne remained in the room and persistently talked about 
moscow amusements and theaters natásha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the 
anteroom by her nervousness and by the unnatural manner of the princess making a favor 
of receiving her and so everything displeased her she did not like princess mary whom 
she thought very plain affected and dry natásha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed 
an offhand air which alienated princess mary still more after five minutes of irksome constrained 
conversation they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching princess mary looked frightened the 
door opened and the old prince in a dressing gown and a white nightcap came 
in madam he began countess countess rostóva if i am not mistaken i beg you 
to excuse me to excuse me i did not know madam god is my witness 
i did not know you had honored us with a visit and i came in 
such a costume only to see my daughter i beg you to excuse me god 
is my witness i he repeated stressing the word so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that 
princess mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her father or 
at natásha nor did the latter having risen and curtsied know what to do mademoiselle 
bourienne alone smiled agreeably beg you to excuse me excuse me god is my witness 
i did not know muttered the old man and after looking natásha over from head 
to foot he went out mademoiselle bourienne was the first to recover herself after this 
apparition and began speaking about the indisposition natásha and princess mary looked at one another 
in silence and the longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say 
the greater grew their antipathy to one another when the count returned natásha was impolitely 
pleased and hastened to get away at that moment she hated the stiff elderly princess 
who could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an hour 
with her without once mentioning prince andrew begin talking about him in the presence of 
that frenchwoman thought natásha the same thought was meanwhile tormenting princess mary she knew what 
she ought to have said to natásha but she had been unable to say it 
because mademoiselle bourienne was in the way and because without knowing why she felt it 
very difficult to speak of the marriage when the count was already leaving the room 
princess mary went up hurriedly to natásha took her by the hand and said with 
a deep sigh i must natásha glanced at her ironically without knowing why natalie said 
princess mary want you to know that i am glad my brother has found happiness 
she paused feeling that she was not telling the truth natásha noticed this and guessed 
its reason think princess it is not convenient to speak of that now she said 
with external dignity and coldness though she felt the tears choking her have i said 
and what have i done thought she as soon as she was out of the 
room they waited a long time for natásha to come to dinner that day she 
sat in her room crying like a child blowing her nose and sobbing sónya stood 
beside her kissing her hair what is it about she asked do they matter to 
you it will all pass natásha if you only knew how offensive it was as 
if i talk about it natásha it your fault so why should you mind kiss 
me said sónya natásha raised her head and kissing her friend on the lips pressed 
her wet face against her tell you i know no to blame said my fault 
but it all hurts terribly oh why he come she came in to dinner with 
red eyes márya dmítrievna who knew how the prince had received the rostóvs pretended not 
to notice how upset natásha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the 
count and the other guests chapter viii that evening the rostóvs went to the opera 
for which márya dmítrievna had taken a box natásha did not want to go but 
could not refuse márya kind offer which was intended expressly for her when she came 
ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father and looking in the large mirror 
there saw that she was pretty very pretty she felt even more sad but it 
was a sweet tender sadness god if he were here now i would not behave 
as i did then but differently i would not be silly and afraid of things 
i would simply embrace him cling to him and make him look at me with 
those searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me and then 
i would make him laugh as he used to laugh and his i see those 
eyes thought natásha what do his father and sister matter to me i love him 
alone him him with that face and those eyes with his smile manly and yet 
childlike no i had better not think of him not think of him but forget 
him quite forget him for the present i bear this waiting and i shall cry 
in a minute and she turned away from the glass making an effort not to 
cry how can sónya love nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so long and 
so patiently thought she looking at sónya who also came in quite ready with a 
fan in her hand altogether different i natásha at that moment felt so softened and 
tender that it was not enough for her to love and know she was beloved 
she wanted now at once to embrace the man she loved to speak and hear 
from him words of love such as filled her heart while she sat in the 
carriage beside her father pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on the 
frozen window she felt still sadder and more in love and forgot where she was 
going and with whom having fallen into the line of carriages the carriage drove up 
to the theater its wheels squeaking over the snow natásha and sónya holding up their 
dresses jumped out quickly the count got out helped by the footmen and passing among 
men and women who were entering and the program sellers they all three went along 
the corridor to the first row of boxes through the closed doors the music was 
already audible your hair whispered sónya an attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies 
and opened the door of their box the music sounded louder and through the door 
rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and shoulders and 
noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms glittered before their eyes a lady entering the next box 
shot a glance of feminine envy at natásha the curtain had not yet risen and 
the overture was being played natásha smoothing her gown went in with sónya and sat 
down scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite a sensation she had not experienced for 
a long of hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and affected her both 
agreeably and disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories desires and emotions associated 
with that feeling the two remarkably pretty girls natásha and sónya with count rostóv who 
had not been seen in moscow for a long time attracted general attention moreover everybody 
knew vaguely of engagement to prince andrew and knew that the rostóvs had lived in 
the country ever since and all looked with curiosity at a fiancée who was making 
one of the best matches in russia looks as everyone told her had improved in 
the country and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty she struck 
those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty combined with her indifference 
to everything about her her black eyes looked at the crowd without seeking anyone and 
her delicate arm bare to above the elbow lay on the velvet edge of the 
box while evidently unconsciously she opened and closed her hand in time to the music 
crumpling her program alénina said sónya her mother it me michael kirílovich has grown still 
stouter remarked the count at our anna a headdress she has on karágins borís with 
them one can see at once that engaged has proposed yes i heard it today 
said shinshín coming into the box natásha looked in the direction in which her eyes 
were turned and saw julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her 
face and a string of pearls round her thick red natásha knew was covered with 
powder behind them wearing a smile and leaning over with an ear to mouth was 
handsome smoothly brushed head he looked at the rostóvs from under his brows and said 
something smiling to his betrothed are talking about us about me and him thought natásha 
he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me they trouble themselves if only they 
knew how little i am concerned about any of them behind them sat anna mikháylovna 
wearing a green headdress and with a happy look of resignation to the will of 
god on her face their box was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple 
which natásha knew so well and liked so much she turned away and suddenly remembered 
all that had been so humiliating in her visit right has he not to wish 
to receive me into his family oh better not think of till he comes back 
she told herself and began looking at the faces some strange and some familiar in 
the stalls in the front in the very center leaning back against the orchestra rail 
stood dólokhov in a persian dress his curly hair brushed up into a huge shock 
he stood in full view of the audience well aware that he was attracting attention 
yet as much at ease as though he were in his own room around him 
thronged most brilliant young men whom he evidently dominated the count laughing nudged the blushing 
sónya and pointed to her former adorer you recognize him said he where has he 
sprung from he asked turning to shinshín he vanish somewhere did replied shinshín was in 
the caucasus and ran away from there they say he has been acting as minister 
to some ruling prince in persia where he killed the brother now all the moscow 
ladies are mad about him the that does it we never hear a word but 
dólokhov is mentioned they swear by him they offer him to you as they would 
a dish of choice sterlet dólokhov and anatole kurágin have turned all our heads a 
tall beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed plump white shoulders 
and neck round which she wore a double string of large pearls entered the adjoining 
box rustling her heavy silk dress and took a long time settling into her place 
natásha involuntarily gazed at that neck those shoulders and pearls and coiffure and admired the 
beauty of the shoulders and the pearls while natásha was fixing her gaze on her 
for the second time the lady looked round and meeting the eyes nodded to him 
and smiled she was the countess bezúkhova wife and the count who knew everyone in 
society leaned over and spoke to her you been here long countess he inquired call 
call to kiss your hand here on business and have brought my girls with me 
they say semënova acts marvelously count pierre never used to forget us is he here 
he meant to look in answered hélène and glanced attentively at natásha count rostóv resumed 
his seat she he whispered to natásha answered natásha a woman one could easily fall 
in love with just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the 
conductor tapped with his stick some latecomers took their seats in the stalls and the 
curtain rose as soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent 
and all the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and all the 
women with gems on their bare flesh turned their whole attention with eager curiosity to 
the stage natásha too began to look at it chapter ix the floor of the 
stage consisted of smooth boards at the sides was some painted cardboard representing trees and 
at the back was a cloth stretched over boards in the center of the stage 
sat some girls in red bodices and white skirts one very fat girl in a 
white silk dress sat apart on a low bench to the back of which a 
piece of green cardboard was glued they all sang something when they had finished their 
song the girl in white went up to the box and a man with tight 
silk trousers over his stout legs and holding a plume and a dagger went up 
to her and began singing waving his arms about first the man in the tight 
trousers sang alone then she sang then they both paused while the orchestra played and 
the man fingered the hand of the girl in white obviously awaiting the beat to 
start singing with her they sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and 
shouting while the man and woman on the represented smiling spreading out their arms and 
bowing after her life in the country and in her present serious mood all this 
seemed grotesque and amazing to natásha she could not follow the opera nor even listen 
to the music she saw only the painted cardboard and the queerly dressed men and 
women who moved spoke and sang so strangely in that brilliant light she knew what 
it was all meant to represent but it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that 
she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused at them she looked at 
the faces of the audience seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity 
she herself experienced but they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage 
and expressed delight which to natásha seemed feigned suppose it has to be like this 
she thought she kept looking round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in 
the stalls and then at the seminude women in the boxes especially at hélène in 
the next box quite with a quiet tranquil smile not taking her eyes off the 
stage and feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and the warm air 
heated by the crowd natásha little by little began to pass into a state of 
intoxication she had not experienced for a long while she did not realize who and 
where she was nor what was going on before her as she looked and thought 
the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her mind the idea occurred to her 
of jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the aria the actress was 
singing then she wished to touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting not far 
from her then to lean over to hélène and tickle her at a moment when 
all was quiet before the commencement of a song a door leading to the stalls 
on the side nearest the box creaked and the steps of a belated arrival were 
heard kurágin whispered shinshín countess bezúkhova turned smiling to the newcomer and natásha following the 
direction of that look saw an exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self 
assured yet courteous bearing this was anatole kurágin whom she had seen and noticed long 
ago at the ball in petersburg he was now in an uniform with one epaulet 
and a shoulder knot he moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous 
had he not been so good looking and had his handsome face not worn such 
an expression of good humored complacency and gaiety though the performance was proceeding he walked 
deliberately down the carpeted gangway his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed 
head held high having looked at natásha he approached his sister laid his well gloved 
hand on the edge of her box nodded to her and leaning forward asked a 
question with a motion toward natásha charmante said he evidently referring to natásha who did 
not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his lips then 
he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down beside 
dólokhov nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way that dólokhov whom others 
treated so fawningly he winked at him gaily smiled and rested his foot against the 
orchestra screen like the brother is to the sister remarked the count how handsome they 
both are shinshín lowering his voice began to tell the count of some intrigue of 
in moscow and natásha tried to overhear it just because he had said she was 
the first act was over in the stalls everyone began moving about going out and 
coming in borís came to the box received their congratulations very simply and raising his 
eyebrows with an absent minded smile conveyed to natásha and sónya his invitation to her 
wedding and went away natásha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him and congratulated 
on his approaching wedding that same borís with whom she had formerly been in love 
in the state of intoxication she was in everything seemed simple and natural the scantily 
clad hélène smiled at everyone in the same way and natásha gave borís a similar 
smile box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most distinguished and intellectual 
men who seemed to vie with one another in their wish to let everyone see 
that they knew her during the whole of that kurágin stood with dólokhov in front 
of the orchestra partition looking at the box natásha knew he was talking about her 
and this afforded her pleasure she even turned so that he should see her profile 
in what she thought was its most becoming aspect before the beginning of the second 
act pierre appeared in the stalls the rostóvs had not seen him since their arrival 
his face looked sad and he had grown still stouter since natásha last saw him 
he passed up to the front rows not noticing anyone anatole went up to him 
and began speaking to him looking at and indicating the box on seeing natásha pierre 
grew animated and hastily passing between the rows came toward their box when he got 
there he leaned on his elbows and smiling talked to her for a long time 
while conversing with pierre natásha heard a voice in countess box and something told her 
it was kurágin she turned and their eyes met almost smiling he gazed straight into 
her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be so 
near him to look at him like that to be so sure he admired her 
and not to be acquainted with him in the second act there was scenery representing 
tombstones there was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon shades were 
raised over the footlights and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many people 
appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding things like daggers in their 
hands they began waving their arms then some other people ran in and began dragging 
away the maiden who had been in white and was now in light blue they 
did not drag her away at once but sang with her for a long time 
and then at last dragged her off and behind the scenes something metallic was struck 
three times and everyone knelt down and sang a prayer all these things were repeatedly 
interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience during this act every time natásha looked 
toward the stalls she saw anatole kurágin with an arm thrown across the back of 
his chair staring at her she was pleased to see that he was captivated by 
her and it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it 
when the second act was over countess bezúkhova rose turned to the whole bosom completely 
the old count with a gloved finger and paying no attention to those who had 
entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile make me acquainted with 
your charming daughters said she whole town is singing their praises and i even know 
them natásha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess she was so pleased by praise 
from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure want to become a moscovite too 
now said hélène is it not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country countess 
bezúkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating woman she could say what she 
did not what was simply and naturally count you must let me look after your 
daughters though i am not staying here long this are will try to amuse them 
i have already heard much of you in petersburg and wanted to get to know 
you said she to natásha with her stereotyped and lovely smile had heard about you 
from my page drubetskóy have you heard he is getting married and also from my 
friend bolkónski prince andrew bolkónski she went on with special emphasis implying that she knew 
of his relation to natásha to get better acquainted she asked that one of the 
young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the performance and natásha 
moved over to it the scene of the third act represented a palace in which 
many candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the walls 
in the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen the king waved 
his right arm and evidently nervous sang something badly and sat down on a crimson 
throne the maiden who had been first in white and then in light blue now 
wore only a smock and stood beside the throne with her hair down she sang 
something mournfully addressing the queen but the king waved his arm severely and men and 
women with bare legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together then 
the violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick bare 
legs and thin arms separating from the others went behind the wings adjusted her bodice 
returned to the middle of the stage and began jumping and striking one foot rapidly 
against the other in the stalls everyone clapped and shouted then one of the men 
went into a corner of the stage the cymbals and horns in the orchestra struck 
up more loudly and this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his 
feet about very rapidly he was duport who received sixty thousand rubles a year for 
this art everybody in the stalls boxes and galleries began clapping and shouting with all 
their might and the man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides then 
other men and women danced with bare legs then the king again shouted to the 
sound of music and they all began singing but suddenly a storm came on chromatic 
scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the orchestra everyone ran off again dragging one 
of their number away and the curtain dropped once more there was a terrible noise 
and clatter among the audience and with rapturous faces everyone began shouting duport duport natásha 
no longer thought this strange she looked about with pleasure smiling joyfully duport delightful hélène 
asked her yes replied natásha chapter x during the a whiff of cold air came 
into box the door opened and anatole entered stooping and trying not to brush against 
anyone me introduce my brother to you said hélène her eyes shifting uneasily from natásha 
to anatole natásha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer and smiled 
at him over her bare shoulder anatole who was as handsome at close quarters as 
at a distance sat down beside her and told her he had long wished to 
have this since the ball in fact at which he had had the well remembered 
pleasure of seeing her kurágin was much more sensible and simple with women than among 
men he talked boldly and naturally and natásha was strangely and agreeably struck by the 
fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much 
talk but that on the contrary his smile was most naïve cheerful and good natured 
kurágin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a previous performance 
semënova had fallen down on the stage do you know countess he said suddenly addressing 
her as an old familiar acquaintance are getting up a costume tournament you ought to 
take part in it it will be great fun we shall all meet at the 
please come no really eh said he while saying this he never removed his smiling 
eyes from her face her neck and her bare arms natásha knew for certain that 
he was enraptured by her this pleased her yet his presence made her feel constrained 
and oppressed when she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking 
at her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should look into 
hers rather than this but looking into his eyes she was frightened realizing that there 
was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other men 
she did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come to 
feel herself terribly near to this man when she turned away she feared he might 
seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck they 
spoke of most ordinary things yet she felt that they were closer to one another 
than she had ever been to any man natásha kept turning to hélène and to 
her father as if asking what it all meant but hélène was engaged in conversation 
with a general and did not answer her look and her eyes said nothing but 
what they always said a good time well glad of it during one of these 
moments of awkward silence when prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her natásha 
to break the silence asked him how he liked moscow she asked the question and 
blushed she felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing something 
improper anatole smiled as though to encourage her first i did not like it much 
because what makes a town pleasant ce sont les jolies femmes that so but now 
i like it very much indeed he said looking at her significantly come to the 
costume tournament countess do come and putting out his hand to her bouquet and dropping 
his voice he added will be the prettiest there do come dear countess and give 
me this flower as a pledge are the pretty women natásha did not understand what 
he was saying any more than he did himself but she felt that his incomprehensible 
words had an improper intention she did not know what to say and turned away 
as if she had not heard his remark but as soon as she had turned 
away she felt that he was there behind so close behind her is he now 
confused angry ought i to put it right she asked herself and she could not 
refrain from turning round she looked straight into his eyes and his nearness self assurance 
and the good natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her she smiled just as he 
was doing gazing straight into his eyes and again she felt with horror that no 
barrier lay between him and her the curtain rose again anatole left the box serene 
and gay natásha went back to her father in the other box now quite submissive 
to the world she found herself in all that was going on before her now 
seemed quite natural but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her betrothed 
of princess mary or of life in the country did not once recur to her 
mind and were as if belonging to a remote past in the fourth act there 
was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm about till the boards were 
withdrawn from under him and he disappeared down below that was the only part of 
the fourth act that natásha saw she felt agitated and tormented and the cause of 
this was kurágin whom she could not help watching as they were leaving the theater 
anatole came up to them called their carriage and helped them in as he was 
putting natásha in he pressed her arm above the elbow agitated and flushed she turned 
round he was looking at her with glittering eyes smiling tenderly only after she had 
reached home was natásha able clearly to think over what had happened to her and 
suddenly remembering prince andrew she was horrified and at tea to which all had sat 
down after the opera she gave a loud exclamation flushed and ran out of the 
room god i am lost she said to herself could i let him she sat 
for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize what 
had happened to her but was unable either to understand what had happened or what 
she felt everything seemed dark obscure and terrible there in that enormous illuminated theater where 
the bare legged duport in a tinsel decorated jacket jumped about to the music on 
wet boards and young girls and old men and the nearly naked hélène with her 
proud calm smile rapturously cried in the presence of that hélène it had all seemed 
clear and simple but now alone by herself it was incomprehensible is it what was 
that terror i felt of him what is this gnawing of conscience i am feeling 
now she thought only to the old countess at night in bed could natásha have 
told all she was feeling she knew that sónya with her severe and simple views 
would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a confession 
so natásha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself i spoiled for love 
or not she asked herself and with soothing irony replied a fool i am to 
ask that what did happen to me nothing i have done nothing i lead him 
on at all nobody will know and i shall never see him again she told 
herself it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of 
and andrew can love me still but why o god why he here natásha quieted 
herself for a moment but again some instinct told her that though all this was 
true and though nothing had happened yet the former purity of her love for prince 
andrew had perished and again in imagination she went over her whole conversation with kurágin 
and again saw the face gestures and tender smile of that bold handsome man when 
he pressed her arm chapter xi anatole kurágin was staying in moscow because his father 
had sent him away from petersburg where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles a 
year in cash besides running up debts for as much more which his creditors demanded 
from his father his father announced to him that he would now pay half his 
debts for the last time but only on condition that he went to moscow as 
adjutant to the commander in post his father had procured for would at last try 
to make a good match there he indicated to him princess mary and julie karágina 
anatole consented and went to moscow where he put up at house pierre received him 
unwillingly at first but got used to him after a while sometimes even accompanied him 
on his carousals and gave him money under the guise of loans as shinshín had 
remarked from the time of his arrival anatole had turned the heads of the moscow 
ladies especially by the fact that he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls 
and french the chief of whom mademoiselle george he was said to be on intimate 
relations he had never missed a carousal at or other moscow drank whole nights through 
outvying everyone else and was at all the balls and parties of the best society 
there was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies and he flirted with 
a few of them at the balls but he did not run after the unmarried 
girls especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain there was a special 
reason for this as he had got married two years fact known only to his 
most intimate friends at that time while with his regiment in poland a polish landowner 
of small means had forced him to marry his daughter anatole had very soon abandoned 
his wife and for a payment which he agreed to send to his father in 
law had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor anatole was 
always content with his position with himself and with others he was instinctively and thoroughly 
convinced that it was impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and 
that he had never in his life done anything base he was incapable of considering 
how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or that action 
of his might be he was convinced that as a duck is so made that 
it must live in water so god had made him such that he must spend 
thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in society he believed 
this so firmly that others looking at him were persuaded of it too and did 
not refuse him either a leading place in society or money which he borrowed from 
anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay he was not a gambler at any 
rate he did not care about winning he was not vain he did not mind 
what people thought of him still less could he be accused of ambition more than 
once he had vexed his father by spoiling his own career and he laughed at 
distinctions of all kinds he was not mean and did not refuse anyone who asked 
of him all he cared about was gaiety and women and as according to his 
ideas there was nothing dishonorable in these tastes and he was incapable of considering what 
the gratification of his tastes entailed for others he honestly considered himself irreproachable sincerely despised 
rogues and bad people and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high rakes those 
male magdalenes have a secret feeling of innocence similar to that which female magdalenes have 
based on the same hope of forgiveness will be forgiven her for she loved much 
and all will be forgiven him for he enjoyed much dólokhov who had reappeared that 
year in moscow after his exile and his persian adventures and was leading a life 
of luxury gambling and dissipation associated with his old petersburg comrade kurágin and made use 
of him for his own ends anatole was sincerely fond of dólokhov for his cleverness 
and audacity dólokhov who needed anatole name position and connections as a bait to draw 
rich young men into his gambling set made use of him and amused himself at 
his expense without letting the other feel it apart from the advantage he derived from 
anatole the very process of dominating will was in itself a pleasure a habit and 
a necessity to dólokhov natásha had made a strong impression on kurágin at supper after 
the opera he described to dólokhov with the air of a connoisseur the attractions of 
her arms shoulders feet and hair and expressed his intention of making love to her 
anatole had no notion and was incapable of considering what might come of such love 
making as he never had any notion of the outcome of any of his actions 
first rate my dear fellow but not for us replied dólokhov will tell my sister 
to ask her to dinner said anatole better wait till married know i adore little 
girls they lose their heads at once pursued anatole have been caught once already by 
a girl said dólokhov who knew of marriage care that happen twice eh said anatole 
with a good humored laugh chapter xii the day after the opera the rostóvs went 
nowhere and nobody came to see them márya dmítrievna talked to the count about something 
which they concealed from natásha natásha guessed they were talking about the old prince and 
planning something and this disquieted and offended her she was expecting prince andrew any moment 
and twice that day sent a manservant to the vozdvízhenka to ascertain whether he had 
come he had not arrived she suffered more now than during her first days in 
moscow to her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant recollection of 
her interview with princess mary and the old prince and a fear and anxiety of 
which she did not understand the cause she continually fancied that either he would never 
come or that something would happen to her before he came she could no longer 
think of him by herself calmly and continuously as she had done before as soon 
as she began to think of him the recollection of the old prince of princess 
mary of the theater and of kurágin mingled with her thoughts the question again presented 
itself whether she was not guilty whether she had not already broken faith with prince 
andrew and again she found herself recalling to the minutest detail every word every gesture 
and every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who 
had been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling to the 
family natásha seemed livelier than usual but she was far less tranquil and happy than 
before on sunday morning márya dmítrievna invited her visitors to mass at her parish church 
of the assumption built over the graves of victims of the plague like those fashionable 
churches she said evidently priding herself on her independence of thought is the same everywhere 
we have an excellent priest he conducts the service decently and with dignity and the 
deacon is the same what holiness is there in giving concerts in the choir i 
like it just self indulgence márya dmítrievna liked sundays and knew how to keep them 
her whole house was scrubbed and cleaned on saturdays neither she nor the servants worked 
and they all wore holiday dress and went to church at her table there were 
extra dishes at dinner and the servants had vodka and roast goose or suckling pig 
but in nothing in the house was the holiday so noticeable as in márya broad 
stern face which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity after mass 
when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where the loose covers had 
been removed from the furniture a servant announced that the carriage was ready and márya 
dmítrievna rose with a stern air she wore her holiday shawl in which she paid 
calls and announced that she was going to see prince nicholas bolkónski to have an 
explanation with him about natásha after she had gone a dressmaker from madame suppert roguet 
waited on the rostóvs and natásha very glad of this diversion having shut herself into 
a room adjoining the drawing room occupied herself trying on the new dresses just as 
she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only tacked together and was turning 
her head to see in the glass how the back fitted she heard in the 
drawing room the animated sounds of her voice and made her flush it was hélène 
natásha had not time to take off the bodice before the door opened and countess 
bezúkhova dressed in a purple velvet gown with a high collar came into the room 
beaming with good humored amiable smiles my enchantress she cried to the blushing natásha no 
this is really beyond anything my dear count said she to count rostóv who had 
followed her in can you live in moscow and go nowhere no i let you 
off mademoiselle george will recite at my house tonight and be some people and if 
you bring your lovely are prettier than mademoiselle know you my husband is away in 
tver or i would send him to fetch you you must come you positively must 
between eight and nine she nodded to the dressmaker whom she knew and who had 
curtsied respectfully to her and seated herself in an armchair beside the looking glass draping 
the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely she did not cease chattering good naturedly and 
gaily continually praising beauty she looked at dresses and praised them as well as a 
new dress of her own made of gauze which she had received from paris and 
advised natásha to have one like it anything suits you my charmer she remarked a 
smile of pleasure never left face she felt happy and as if she were blossoming 
under the praise of this dear countess bezúkhova who had formerly seemed to her so 
unapproachable and important and was now so kind to her natásha brightened up and felt 
almost in love with this woman who was so beautiful and so kind hélène for 
her part was sincerely delighted with natásha and wished to give her a good time 
anatole had asked her to bring him and natásha together and she was calling on 
the rostóvs for that purpose the idea of throwing her brother and natásha together amused 
her though at one time in petersburg she had been annoyed with natásha for drawing 
borís away she did not think of that now and in her own way heartily 
wished natásha well as she was leaving the rostóvs she called her protégée aside brother 
dined with me nearly died of ate nothing and kept sighing for you my charmer 
he is madly quite madly in love with you my dear natásha blushed scarlet when 
she heard this she blushes how she blushes my pretty said hélène must certainly come 
if you love somebody my charmer that is not a reason to shut yourself up 
even if you are engaged i am sure your fiancé would wish you to go 
into society rather than be bored to death she knows i am engaged and she 
and her husband good talked and laughed about this so all right and again under 
influence what had seemed terrible now seemed simple and natural she is such a grande 
dame so kind and evidently likes me so much and why not enjoy myself thought 
natásha gazing at hélène with wide open wondering eyes márya dmítrievna came back to dinner 
taciturn and serious having evidently suffered a defeat at the old she was still too 
agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly in answer 
to the inquiries she replied that things were all right and that she would tell 
about it next day on hearing of countess visit and the invitation for that evening 
márya dmítrievna remarked care to have anything to do with bezúkhova and advise you to 
however if it will divert your thoughts she added addressing natásha chapter xiii count rostóv 
took the girls to countess there were a good many people there but nearly all 
strangers to natásha count rostóv was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely 
of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct mademoiselle george was standing 
in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men there were several frenchmen 
present among them métivier who from the time hélène reached moscow had been an intimate 
in her house the count decided not to sit down to cards or let his 
girls out of his sight and to get away as soon as mademoiselle performance was 
over anatole was at the door evidently on the lookout for the rostóvs immediately after 
greeting the count he went up to natásha and followed her as soon as she 
saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had had at the vanity 
at his admiration of her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between 
them hélène welcomed natásha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her beauty and her 
dress soon after their arrival mademoiselle george went out of the room to change her 
costume in the drawing room people began arranging the chairs and taking their seats anatole 
moved a chair for natásha and was about to sit down beside her but the 
count who never lost sight of her took the seat himself anatole sat down behind 
her mademoiselle george with her bare fat dimpled arms and a red shawl draped over 
one shoulder came into the space left vacant for her and assumed an unnatural pose 
enthusiastic whispering was audible mademoiselle george looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and began 
reciting some french verses describing her guilty love for her son in some places she 
raised her voice in others she whispered lifting her head triumphantly sometimes she paused and 
uttered hoarse sounds rolling her eyes divine delicious was heard from every side natásha looked 
at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard nor understood anything of what went 
on before her she only felt herself again completely borne away into this strange senseless 
remote from her old world in which it was impossible to know what was good 
or bad reasonable or senseless behind her sat anatole and conscious of his proximity she 
experienced a frightened sense of expectancy after the first monologue the whole company rose and 
surrounded mademoiselle george expressing their enthusiasm beautiful she is natásha remarked to her father who 
had also risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress think so when 
i look at you said anatole following natásha he said this at a moment when 
she alone could hear him are enchanting from the moment i saw you i have 
never ceased come natásha said the count as he turned back for his daughter beautiful 
she is natásha without saying anything stepped up to her father and looked at him 
with surprised inquiring eyes after giving several recitations mademoiselle george left and countess bezúkhova asked 
her visitors into the ballroom the count wished to go home but hélène entreated him 
not to spoil her improvised ball and the rostóvs stayed on anatole asked natásha for 
a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her 
she was bewitching and that he loved her during the écossaise which she also danced 
with him anatole said nothing when they happened to be by themselves but merely gazed 
at her natásha lifted her frightened eyes to him but there was such confident tenderness 
in his affectionate look and smile that she could not whilst looking at him say 
what she had to say she lowered her eyes say such things to me i 
am betrothed and love another she said rapidly she glanced at him anatole was not 
upset or pained by what she had said speak to me of that what can 
i do said he tell you i am madly madly in love with you is 
it my fault that you are enchanting our turn to begin natásha animated and excited 
looked about her with wide open frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual she understood 
hardly anything that went on that evening they danced the écossaise and the grossvater her 
father asked her to come home but she begged to remain wherever she went and 
whomever she was speaking to she felt his eyes upon her later on she recalled 
how she had asked her father to let her go to the dressing room to 
rearrange her dress that hélène had followed her and spoken laughingly of her love and 
that she again met anatole in the little sitting room hélène had disappeared leaving them 
alone and anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice cannot come 
to visit you but is it possible that i shall never see you i love 
you madly can i never and blocking her path he brought his face close to 
hers his large glittering masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw nothing 
but them he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being painfully pressed understand i 
have nothing to say her eyes replied burning lips were pressed to hers and at 
the same instant she felt herself released and footsteps and the rustle of her dress 
were heard in the room natásha looked round at her and then red and trembling 
threw a frightened look of inquiry at anatole and moved toward the door word just 
one for sake cried anatole she paused she so wanted a word from him that 
would explain to her what had happened and to which she could find no answer 
just a word only one he kept repeating evidently not knowing what to say and 
he repeated it till hélène came up to them hélène returned with natásha to the 
drawing room the rostóvs went away without staying for supper after reaching home natásha did 
not sleep all night she was tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved anatole 
or prince andrew she loved prince remembered distinctly how deeply she loved him but she 
also loved anatole of that there was no doubt how could all this have happened 
thought she after that i could return his smile when saying good by if i 
was able to let it come to that it means that i loved him from 
the first it means that he is kind noble and splendid and i could not 
help loving him what am i to do if i love him and the other 
one too she asked herself unable to find an answer to these terrible questions chapter 
xiv morning came with its cares and bustle everyone got up and began to move 
about and talk dressmakers came again márya dmítrievna appeared and they were called to breakfast 
natásha kept looking uneasily at everybody with wide open eyes as if wishing to intercept 
every glance directed toward her and tried to appear the same as usual after breakfast 
which was her best time márya dmítrievna sat down in her armchair and called natásha 
and the count to her friends i have now thought the whole matter over and 
this is my advice she began as you know i went to see prince bolkónski 
well i had a talk with him he took it into his head to begin 
shouting but i am not one to be shouted down i said what i had 
to say and he asked the count crazy he did not want to listen but 
the use of talking as it is we have worn the poor girl out said 
márya dmítrievna advice to you is finish your business and go back home to otrádnoe 
and wait there no exclaimed natásha go back said márya dmítrievna wait there if your 
betrothed comes here will be no avoiding a quarrel but alone with the old man 
he will talk things over and then come on to you count rostóv approved of 
this suggestion appreciating its reasonableness if the old man came round it would be all 
the better to visit him in moscow or at bald hills later on and if 
not the wedding against his wishes could only be arranged at otrádnoe is perfectly true 
and i am sorry i went to see him and took her said the old 
count why be sorry being here you had to pay your respects but if he 
his affair said márya dmítrievna looking for something in her reticule the trousseau is ready 
so there is nothing to wait for and what is not ready send after you 
though i like letting you go it is the best way so go with blessing 
having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to natásha 
it was a letter from princess mary has written to you how she torments herself 
poor thing afraid you might think that she does not like you she like me 
said natásha talk nonsense cried márya dmítrievna believe anyone i know she like me replied 
natásha boldly as she took the letter and her face expressed a cold and angry 
resolution that caused márya dmítrievna to look at her more intently and to frown answer 
like that my good girl she said i say is true write an answer natásha 
did not reply and went to her own room to read princess letter princess mary 
wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that had occurred between them whatever 
her feelings might be she begged natásha to believe that she could not help loving 
her as the one chosen by her brother for whose happiness she was ready to 
sacrifice everything not think however she wrote my father is ill disposed toward you he 
is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven but he is good 
and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy princess mary went on 
to ask natásha to fix a time when she could see her again after reading 
the letter natásha sat down at the writing table to answer it princess she wrote 
in french quickly and mechanically and then paused what more could she write after all 
that had happened the evening before yes all that has happened and now all is 
changed she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her i 
break off with him must i really awful and to escape from these dreadful thoughts 
she went to sónya and began sorting patterns with her after dinner natásha went to 
her room and again took up princess letter it be that it is all over 
she thought it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all 
that went before she recalled her love for prince andrew in all its former strength 
and at the same time felt that she loved kurágin she vividly pictured herself as 
prince wife and the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in 
her imagination and at the same time aglow with excitement recalled every detail of interview 
with anatole could that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment 
so could i be completely happy but now i have to choose and i be 
happy without either of them only she thought tell prince andrew what has happened or 
to hide it from him are both equally impossible but with that one nothing is 
spoiled but am i really to abandon forever the joy of prince love in which 
i have lived so long miss whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious 
air man told me to give you and she handed natásha a letter for sake 
the girl went on as natásha without thinking mechanically broke the seal and read a 
love letter from anatole of which without taking in a word she understood only that 
it was a letter from the man she loved yes she loved him or else 
how could that have happened which had happened and how could she have a love 
letter from him in her hand with trembling hands natásha held that passionate love letter 
which dólokhov had composed for anatole and as she read it she found in it 
an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling yesterday evening my fate 
has been sealed to be loved by you or to die there is no other 
way for me the letter began then he went on to say that he knew 
her parents would not give her to this there were secret reasons he could reveal 
only to that if she loved him she need only say the word yes and 
no human power could hinder their bliss love would conquer all he would steal her 
away and carry her off to the ends of the earth yes i love him 
thought natásha reading the letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning 
in each word of it that evening márya dmítrievna was going to the and proposed 
to take the girls with her natásha pleading a headache remained at home chapter xv 
on returning late in the evening sónya went to room and to her surprise found 
her still dressed and asleep on the sofa open on the table beside her lay 
letter sónya picked it up and read it as she read she glanced at the 
sleeping natásha trying to find in her face an explanation of what she was reading 
but did not find it her face was calm gentle and happy clutching her breast 
to keep herself from choking sónya pale and trembling with fear and agitation sat down 
in an armchair and burst into tears was it i noticed nothing how could it 
go so far can she have left off loving prince andrew and how could she 
let kurágin go to such lengths he is a deceiver and a villain plain what 
will nicholas dear noble nicholas do when he hears of it so this is the 
meaning of her excited resolute unnatural look the day before yesterday yesterday and today thought 
sónya it be that she loves him she probably opened the letter without knowing who 
it was from probably she is offended by it she could not do such a 
thing sónya wiped away her tears and went up to natásha again scanning her face 
she said just audibly natásha awoke and saw sónya back and with the decision and 
tenderness that often come at the moment of awakening she embraced her friend but noticing 
look of embarrassment her own face expressed confusion and suspicion read that letter she demanded 
answered sónya softly natásha smiled rapturously sónya i any longer she said hide it from 
you any longer you know we love one another sónya darling he writes sónya sónya 
stared open eyed at natásha unable to believe her ears bolkónski she asked sónya if 
you only knew how happy i am cried natásha know what love is natásha can 
that be all over natásha looked at sónya with wide open eyes as if she 
could not grasp the question then are you refusing prince andrew said sónya you understand 
anything talk nonsense just listen said natásha with momentary vexation i believe it insisted sónya 
understand how is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly 
why you have only seen him three times natásha i believe you joking in three 
days to forget everything and so days said natásha seems to me loved him a 
hundred years it seems to me that i have never loved anyone before you understand 
it sónya wait a bit sit here and natásha embraced and kissed her had heard 
that it happens like this and you must have heard it too but only now 
that i feel such love not the same as before as soon as i saw 
him i felt he was my master and i his slave and that i could 
not help loving him yes his slave whatever he orders i shall do you understand 
that what can i do what can i do sónya cried natásha with a happy 
yet frightened expression think what you are doing cried sónya leave it like this this 
secret correspondence how could you let him go so far she went on with a 
horror and disgust she could hardly conceal told you that i have no will natásha 
replied you understand i love him i let it come to that i shall tell 
cried sónya bursting into tears do you mean for sake if you tell you are 
my enemy declared natásha want me to be miserable you want us to be separated 
when she saw fright sónya shed tears of shame and pity for her friend what 
has happened between you she asked has he said to you why he come to 
the house natásha did not answer her questions sake sónya tell anyone torture me natásha 
entreated no one ought to interfere in such matters i have confided in you why 
this secrecy why he come to the house asked sónya he openly ask for your 
hand you know prince andrew gave you complete it is really so but i believe 
it natásha have you considered what these secret reasons can be natásha looked at sónya 
with astonishment evidently this question presented itself to her mind for the first time and 
she did not know how to answer it know what the reasons are but there 
must be reasons sónya sighed and shook her head incredulously there were reasons she began 
but natásha guessing her doubts interrupted her in alarm one doubt him one one you 
understand she cried he love you he love me natásha repeated with a smile of 
pity at her lack of comprehension you have read his letter and you have seen 
him if he is dishonorable dishonorable if you only knew exclaimed natásha he is an 
honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease seeing you and if you 
do this i will i will write to him and i will tell papa said 
sónya resolutely i live without him cried natásha i understand you and what are you 
saying think of your father and of nicholas want anyone i love anyone but him 
how dare you say he is dishonorable you know that i love him screamed natásha 
away sónya i want to quarrel with you but go for sake go you see 
how i am suffering natásha cried angrily in a voice of despair and repressed irritation 
sónya burst into sobs and ran from the room natásha went to the table and 
without a reflection wrote that answer to princess mary which she had been unable to 
write all the morning in this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were 
at an end that availing herself of the magnanimity of prince andrew who when he 
went abroad had given her her freedom she begged princess mary to forget everything and 
forgive her if she had been to blame toward her but that she could not 
be his wife at that moment this all seemed quite easy simple and clear to 
natásha on friday the rostóvs were to return to the country but on wednesday the 
count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near moscow on the day the 
count left sónya and natásha were invited to a big dinner party at the and 
márya dmítrievna took them there at that party natásha again met anatole and sónya noticed 
that she spoke to him trying not to be overheard and that all through dinner 
she was more agitated than ever when they got home natásha was the first to 
begin the explanation sónya expected sónya you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him 
natásha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be 
praised have had an explanation today what happened what did he say natásha how glad 
i am not angry with me tell me whole truth what did he say natásha 
became thoughtful sónya if you knew him as i do he said he asked me 
what i had promised bolkónski he was glad i was free to refuse him sónya 
sighed sorrowfully you refused bolkónski said she i have perhaps all is over between me 
and bolkónski why do you think so badly of me think anything only i understand 
this a bit sónya understand everything see what a man he is now think badly 
of me or of him i think badly of anyone i love and pity everybody 
but what am i to do sónya did not succumb to the tender tone natásha 
used toward her the more emotional and ingratiating the expression of face became the more 
serious and stern grew said she asked me not to speak to you and i 
spoken but now you yourself have begun i trust him natásha why this secrecy again 
interrupted natásha i am afraid for you of what am afraid going to your ruin 
said sónya resolutely and was herself horrified at what she had said anger again showed 
in face go to my ruin i will as soon as possible not your business 
it be you but i suffer leave me alone leave me alone i hate you 
moaned sónya aghast hate you i hate you my enemy forever and natásha ran out 
of the room natásha did not speak to sónya again and avoided her with the 
same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house taking up now 
one occupation now another and at once abandoning them hard as it was for sónya 
she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight the day 
before the count was to return sónya noticed that natásha sat by the drawing room 
window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to 
an officer who drove past whom sónya took to be anatole sónya began watching her 
friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening natásha was 
in a strange and unnatural state she answered questions at random began sentences she did 
not finish and laughed at everything after tea sónya noticed a housemaid at door timidly 
waiting to let her pass she let the girl go in and then listening at 
the door learned that another letter had been delivered then suddenly it became clear to 
sónya that natásha had some dreadful plan for that evening sónya knocked at her door 
natásha did not let her in will run away with him thought sónya is capable 
of anything there was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today she cried 
as she said good by to uncle sónya remembered it she means to elope with 
him but what am i to do thought she recalling all the signs that clearly 
indicated that natásha had some terrible intention count is away what am i to do 
write to kurágin demanding an explanation but what is there to oblige him to reply 
write to pierre as prince andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune but 
perhaps she really has already refused sent a letter to princess mary yesterday and uncle 
is away to tell márya dmítrievna who had such faith in natásha seemed to sónya 
terrible anyway thought sónya as she stood in the dark passage or never i must 
prove that i remember the goodness to me and that i love nicholas yes if 
i sleep for three nights not leave this passage and will hold her back by 
force and will and not let the family be disgraced thought she chapter xvi anatole 
had lately moved to the plan for natalie abduction had been arranged and the preparations 
made by dólokhov a few days before and on the day that sónya after listening 
at door resolved to safeguard her it was to have been put into execution natásha 
had promised to come out to kurágin at the back porch at ten that evening 
kurágin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive 
her forty miles to the village of kámenka where an unfrocked priest was in readiness 
to perform a marriage ceremony over them at kámenka a relay of horses was to 
wait which would take them to the warsaw highroad and from there they would hasten 
abroad with post horses anatole had a passport an order for post horses ten thousand 
rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with help two 
witnesses for the mock a retired petty official whom dólokhov made use of in his 
gambling transactions and makárin a retired hussar a kindly weak fellow who had an unbounded 
affection for sitting at tea in front room in his large study the walls of 
which were hung to the ceiling with persian rugs bearskins and weapons sat dólokhov in 
a traveling cloak and high boots at an open desk on which lay an abacus 
and some bundles of paper money anatole with uniform unbuttoned walked to and fro from 
the room where the witnesses were sitting through the study to the room behind where 
his french valet and others were packing the last of his things dólokhov was counting 
the money and noting something down he said must have two thousand it to him 
then said anatole their name for makárin go through fire and water for you for 
nothing so here are our accounts all settled said dólokhov showing him the memorandum that 
right of course returned anatole evidently not listening to dólokhov and looking straight before him 
with a smile that did not leave his face dólokhov banged down the lid of 
his desk and turned to anatole with an ironic smile you know really better drop 
it all still time retorted anatole talk nonsense if you only knew the devil knows 
what really give it up said dólokhov am speaking seriously no joke this plot hatched 
teasing again go to the devil eh said anatole making a grimace no time for 
your stupid jokes and he left the room dólokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when anatole 
had gone out wait a bit he called after him not joking talking sense come 
here come here anatole returned and looked at dólokhov trying to give him his attention 
and evidently submitting to him involuntarily listen to me telling you this for the last 
time why should i joke about it did i hinder you who arranged everything for 
you who found the priest and got the passport who raised the money i did 
it all thank you for it do you think i am not grateful and anatole 
sighed and embraced dólokhov helped you but all the same i must tell you the 
truth it is a dangerous business and if you think about stupid business well carry 
her right will they let it stop at that it will come out that already 
married why have you in the criminal court nonsense nonsense anatole ejaculated and again made 
a grimace i explain to you what and anatole with the partiality dull witted people 
have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning repeated the argument he 
had already put to dólokhov a hundred times i explain to you that i have 
come to this conclusion if this marriage is invalid he went on crooking one finger 
i have nothing to answer for but if it is valid no matter abroad no 
one will know anything about it that so and talk to me better drop it 
only get yourself into a mess to the devil cried anatole and clutching his hair 
left the room but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of 
dólokhov with his feet turned under him the very devil what feel how it beats 
he took hand and put it on his heart a foot my dear fellow what 
a glance a goddess he added in french dólokhov with a cold smile and a 
gleam in his handsome insolent eyes looked at wishing to get some more amusement out 
of him and when the gone what then then eh repeated anatole sincerely perplexed by 
a thought of the future then then i know but why talk nonsense he glanced 
at his watch time anatole went into the back room then nearly ready dawdling he 
shouted to the servants dólokhov put away the money called a footman whom he ordered 
to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey and went into 
the room where khvóstikov and makárin were sitting anatole lay on the sofa in the 
study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to 
himself and eat something have a drink dólokhov shouted to him from the other room 
want to answered anatole continuing to smile balagá is here anatole rose and went into 
the dining room balagá was a famous troyka driver who had known dólokhov and anatole 
some six years and had given them good service with his troykas more than once 
when regiment was stationed at tver he had taken him from tver in the evening 
brought him to moscow by daybreak and driven him back again the next night more 
than once he had enabled dólokhov to escape when pursued more than once he had 
driven them through the town with gypsies and as he called the cocottes more than 
once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets 
of moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by as he called them 
he had ruined more than one horse in their service more than once they had 
beaten him and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and madeira 
which he loved and he knew more than one thing about each of them which 
would long ago have sent an ordinary man to siberia they often called balagá into 
their orgies and made him drink and dance at the and more than one thousand 
rubles of their money had passed through his hands in their service he risked his 
skin and his life twenty times a year and in their service had lost more 
horses than the money he had from them would buy but he liked them liked 
that mad driving at twelve miles an hour liked upsetting a driver or running down 
a pedestrian and flying at full gallop through the moscow streets he liked to hear 
those wild tipsy shouts behind him on get on when it was impossible to go 
any faster he liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who 
more dead than alive was already hurrying out of his way gentlemen he considered them 
anatole and dólokhov liked balagá too for his masterly driving and because he liked the 
things they liked with others balagá bargained charging twenty five rubles for a two drive 
and rarely drove himself generally letting his young men do so but with he always 
drove himself and never demanded anything for his work only a couple of times a 
he knew from their valets that they had money in would turn up of a 
morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him the 
gentlemen always made him sit down help me out theodore iványch sir or excellency he 
would say am quite out of horses let me have what you can to go 
to the fair and anatole and dólokhov when they had money would give him a 
thousand or a couple of thousand rubles balagá was a fair haired short and snub 
nosed peasant of about twenty seven red faced with a particularly red thick neck glittering 
little eyes and a small beard he wore a fine dark blue silk lined cloth 
coat over a sheepskin on entering the room now he crossed himself turning toward the 
front corner of the room and went up to dólokhov holding out a small black 
hand iványch he said bowing do friend well here he is day your excellency he 
said again holding out his hand to anatole who had just come in say balagá 
said anatole putting his hands on the shoulders you care for me or not eh 
now do me a service what horses have you come with eh your messenger ordered 
your special beasts replied balagá listen balagá drive all three to death but get me 
there in three hours eh they are dead what shall i drive said balagá with 
a wink smash your face in make jokes cried anatole suddenly rolling his eyes joke 
said the driver laughing if grudge my gentlemen anything as fast as ever the horses 
can gallop so fast go said anatole sit down sit down said dólokhov stand theodore 
iványch down nonsense have a drink said anatole and filled a large glass of madeira 
for him the eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine after refusing it for 
sake he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief he took 
out of his cap when are we to start your excellency anatole looked at his 
watch start at once mind balagá get there in time eh depends on our luck 
in starting else why we be there in time replied balagá we get you to 
tver in seven hours i think you remember that your excellency you know one christmas 
i drove from tver said anatole smilingly at the recollection and turning to makárin who 
gazed rapturously at him with wide open eyes you believe it makárka it took breath 
away the rate we flew we came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove 
right over two of them eh were horses balagá continued the tale time harnessed two 
young side horses with the bay in the shafts he went on turning to dólokhov 
you believe it theodore iványch those animals flew forty miles i hold them in my 
hands grew numb in the sharp frost so that i threw down the hold yourself 
your excellency says i and i just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and 
sprawled there it a case of urging them on there was no holding them in 
till we reached the place the devils took us there in three hours only the 
near one died of it chapter xvii anatole went out of the room and returned 
a few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt and a 
sable cap jauntily set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face having 
looked in a mirror and standing before dólokhov in the same pose he had assumed 
before it he lifted a glass of wine good by theodore thank you for everything 
and farewell said anatole comrades and friends he considered for a moment of my youth 
farewell he said turning to makárin and the others though they were all going with 
him anatole evidently wished to make something touching and solemn out of this address to 
his comrades he spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly 
swayed one leg take glasses you too balagá well comrades and friends of my youth 
had our fling and lived and reveled eh and now when shall we meet again 
i am going abroad we have had a good farewell lads to our health hurrah 
he cried and emptying his glass flung it on the floor your health said balagá 
who also emptied his glass and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief makárin embraced anatole 
with tears in his eyes prince how sorry i am to part from you go 
go cried anatole balagá was about to leave the room stop said anatole the door 
we have first to sit down the way they shut the door and all sat 
down quick march lads said anatole rising joseph his valet handed him his sabretache and 
saber and they all went out into the vestibule the fur cloak asked dólokhov ignátka 
go to matrëna matrévna and ask her for the sable cloak i have heard what 
elopements are like continued dólokhov with a wink rush out more dead than alive just 
in the things she is wearing if you delay at all be tears and and 
and frozen in a minute and must go you wrap the fur cloak round her 
first thing and carry her to the sleigh the valet brought a fox lined cloak 
i told you the sable one hey matrëna the sable he shouted so that his 
voice rang far through the rooms a handsome slim and pale faced gypsy girl with 
glittering black eyes and curly blue black hair wearing a red shawl ran out with 
a sable mantle on her arm i grudge it she said evidently afraid of her 
master and yet regretful of her cloak dólokhov without answering took the cloak threw it 
over matrëna and wrapped her up in it the way said dólokhov then so and 
he turned the collar up round her head leaving only a little of the face 
uncovered then so do you see and he pushed head forward to meet the gap 
left by the collar through which brilliant smile was seen good by matrëna said anatole 
kissing her my revels here are over remember me to stëshka there good by good 
by matrëna wish me luck prince may god give you great luck said matrëna in 
her gypsy accent two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were 
holding the horses balagá took his seat in the front one and holding his elbows 
high arranged the reins deliberately anatole and dólokhov got in with him makárin khvóstikov and 
a valet seated themselves in the other sleigh are you ready asked balagá he cried 
twisting the reins round his hands and the troyka tore down the nikítski boulevard get 
out of the way hi tproo the shouting of balagá and of the sturdy young 
fellow seated on the box was all that could be heard on the arbát square 
the troyka caught against a carriage something cracked shouts were heard and the troyka flew 
along the arbát street after taking a turn along the podnovínski boulevard balagá began to 
rein in and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old konyúsheny street 
the young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and anatole and 
dólokhov went along the pavement when they reached the gate dólokhov whistled the whistle was 
answered and a maidservant ran out into the courtyard or be seen come out directly 
said she dólokhov stayed by the gate anatole followed the maid into the courtyard turned 
the corner and ran up into the porch he was met by gabriel márya gigantic 
footman to the mistress please said the footman in his deep bass intercepting any retreat 
what mistress who are you asked anatole in a breathless whisper step in my orders 
are to bring you in come back shouted dólokhov back dólokhov after anatole entered had 
remained at the wicket gate and was struggling with the yard porter who was trying 
to lock it with a last desperate effort dólokhov pushed the porter aside and when 
anatole ran back seized him by the arm pulled him through the wicket and ran 
back with him to the troyka chapter xviii márya dmítrievna having found sónya weeping in 
the corridor made her confess everything and intercepting the note to natásha she read it 
and went into room with it in her hand shameless good for nothing said she 
hear a word pushing back natásha who looked at her with astonished but tearless eyes 
she locked her in and having given orders to the yard porter to admit the 
persons who would be coming that evening but not to let them out again and 
having told the footman to bring them up to her she seated herself in the 
drawing room to await the abductors when gabriel came to inform her that the men 
who had come had run away again she rose frowning and clasping her hands behind 
her paced through the rooms a long time considering what she should do toward midnight 
she went to room fingering the key in her pocket sónya was sitting sobbing in 
the corridor dmítrievna for sake let me in to her she pleaded but márya dmítrievna 
unlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer abominable in my house 
horrid girl hussy only sorry for her father thought she trying to restrain her wrath 
as it may be tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it 
from the count she entered the room with resolute steps natásha lying on the sofa 
her head hidden in her hands and she did not stir she was in just 
the same position in which márya dmítrievna had left her nice girl very nice said 
márya dmítrievna meetings with lovers in my house no use pretending you listen when i 
speak to you and márya dmítrievna touched her arm when i speak disgraced yourself like 
the lowest of hussies treat you differently but sorry for your father so i will 
conceal it natásha did not change her position but her whole body heaved with noiseless 
convulsive sobs which choked her márya dmítrievna glanced round at sónya and seated herself on 
the sofa beside natásha lucky for him that he escaped me but find him she 
said in her rough voice you hear what i am saying or not she added 
she put her large hand under face and turned it toward her both márya dmítrievna 
and sónya were amazed when they saw how natásha looked her eyes were dry and 
glistening her lips compressed her cheeks sunken me be what is it to me i 
shall die she muttered wrenching herself from márya hands with a vicious effort and sinking 
down again into her former position said márya dmítrievna wish for your good lie still 
stay like that then i touch you but listen i tell you how guilty you 
are you know that yourself but when your father comes back tomorrow what am i 
to tell him eh again body shook with sobs he finds out and your brother 
and your betrothed have no betrothed i have refused him cried natásha all the same 
continued márya dmítrievna they hear of this will they let it pass he your father 
i know him if he challenges him to a duel will that be all right 
eh let me be why have you interfered at all why why who asked you 
to shouted natásha raising herself on the sofa and looking malignantly at márya dmítrievna what 
did you want cried márya dmítrievna growing angry again you kept under lock and key 
who hindered his coming to the house why carry you off as if you were 
some gypsy singing girl well if he had carried you off do you think they 
have found him your father or brother or your betrothed and a scoundrel a a 
fact is better than any of you exclaimed natásha getting up you interfered oh my 
god what is it all what is it sónya why go away and she burst 
into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people bewail disasters they feel they have 
themselves occasioned márya dmítrievna was to speak again but natásha cried out away go away 
you all hate and despise me and she threw herself back on the sofa márya 
dmítrievna went on admonishing her for some time enjoining on her that it must all 
be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody would know anything about it 
if only natásha herself would undertake to forget it all and not let anyone see 
that something had happened natásha did not reply nor did she sob any longer but 
she grew cold and had a shivering fit márya dmítrievna put a pillow under her 
head covered her with two quilts and herself brought her some lime flower water but 
natásha did not respond to her let her sleep said márya dmítrievna as she went 
out of the room supposing natásha to be asleep but natásha was not asleep with 
pale face and fixed wide open eyes she looked straight before her all that night 
she did not sleep or weep and did not speak to sónya who got up 
and went to her several times next day count rostóv returned from his estate near 
moscow in time for lunch as he had promised he was in very good spirits 
the affair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily and there was nothing to keep 
him any longer in moscow away from the countess whom he missed márya dmítrievna met 
him and told him that natásha had been very unwell the day before and that 
they had sent for the doctor but that she was better now natásha had not 
left her room that morning with compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes she 
sat at the window uneasily watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round 
at anyone who entered the room she was evidently expecting news of him and that 
he would come or would write to her when the count came to see her 
she turned anxiously round at the sound of a footstep and then her face resumed 
its cold and malevolent expression she did not even get up to greet him is 
the matter with you my angel are you ill asked the count after a silence 
natásha answered ill in reply to the anxious inquiries as to why she was so 
dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed she assured him that nothing had 
happened and asked him not to worry márya dmítrievna confirmed assurances that nothing had happened 
from the pretense of illness from his distress and by the embarrassed faces of sónya 
and márya dmítrievna the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his absence 
but it was so terrible for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to 
his beloved daughter and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity that he avoided inquiries 
and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly had happened and he was only dissatisfied 
that her indisposition delayed their return to the country chapter xix from the day his 
wife arrived in moscow pierre had been intending to go away somewhere so as not 
to be near her soon after the rostóvs came to moscow the effect natásha had 
on him made him hasten to carry out his intention he went to tver to 
see joseph widow who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers 
of her deceased when he returned to moscow pierre was handed a letter from márya 
dmítrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great importance relating 
to andrew bolkónski and his betrothed pierre had been avoiding natásha because it seemed to 
him that his feeling for her was stronger than a married should be for his 
fiancée yet some fate constantly threw them together can have happened and what can they 
want with me thought he as he dressed to go to márya only prince andrew 
would hurry up and come and marry her thought he on his way to the 
house on the tverskóy boulevard a familiar voice called to him been back long someone 
shouted pierre raised his head in a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting horses that 
were bespattering the dashboard with snow anatole and his constant companion makárin dashed past anatole 
was sitting upright in the classic pose of military dandies the lower part of his 
face hidden by his beaver collar and his head slightly bent his face was fresh 
and rosy his white plumed hat tilted to one side disclosed his curled and pomaded 
hair besprinkled with powdery snow indeed a true sage thought pierre sees nothing beyond the 
pleasure of the moment nothing troubles him and so he is always cheerful satisfied and 
serene what i give to be like him he thought enviously in márya anteroom the 
footman who helped him off with his fur coat said that the mistress asked him 
to come to her bedroom when he opened the ballroom door pierre saw natásha sitting 
at the window with a thin pale and spiteful face she glanced round at him 
frowned and left the room with an expression of cold dignity has happened asked pierre 
entering márya room doings answered dmítrievna fifty eight years have i lived in this world 
and never known anything so disgraceful and having put him on his honor not to 
repeat anything she told him márya dmítrievna informed him that natásha had refused prince andrew 
without her knowledge and that the cause of this was anatole kurágin into whose society 
wife had thrown her and with whom natásha had tried to elope during her absence 
in order to be married secretly pierre raised his shoulders and listened open mouthed to 
what was told him scarcely able to believe his own ears that prince deeply loved 
affianced same natásha rostóva who used to be so give up bolkónski for that fool 
anatole who was already secretly married as pierre knew and should be so in love 
with him as to agree to run away with him was something pierre could not 
conceive and could not imagine he could not reconcile the charming impression he had of 
natásha whom he had known from a child with this new conception of her baseness 
folly and cruelty he thought of his wife are all alike he said to himself 
reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a 
bad woman but still he pitied prince andrew to the point of tears and sympathized 
with his wounded pride and the more he pitied his friend the more did he 
think with contempt and even with disgust of that natásha who had just passed him 
in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity he did not know that 
soul was overflowing with despair shame and humiliation and that it was not her fault 
that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity and severity how get 
married said pierre in answer to márya dmítrievna could not is married get worse from 
hour to hour ejaculated márya dmítrievna nice youth what a scoundrel and expecting him since 
yesterday she must be told then at least she go on expecting him after hearing 
the details of marriage from pierre and giving vent to her anger against anatole in 
words of abuse márya dmítrievna told pierre why she had sent for him she was 
afraid that the count or bolkónski who might arrive at any moment if they knew 
of this affair which she hoped to hide from them might challenge anatole to a 
duel and she therefore asked pierre to tell his brother in law in her name 
to leave moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again now 
realizing the danger to the old count nicholas and prince to do as she wished 
having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him she let him go to the 
drawing room the count knows nothing behave as if you know nothing either she said 
i will go and tell her it is no use expecting him and stay to 
dinner if you care to she called after pierre pierre met the old count who 
seemed nervous and upset that morning natásha had told him that she had rejected bolkónski 
troubles my dear fellow he said to pierre troubles one has with these girls without 
their mother i do so regret having come here i will be frank with you 
have you heard she has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody true this engagement 
never was much to my liking of course he is an excellent man but still 
with his disapproval they have been happy and natásha lack suitors still it has been 
going on so long and to take such a step without or consent and now 
ill and god knows what hard count hard to manage daughters in their absence pierre 
saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the subject but the 
count returned to his troubles sónya entered the room with an agitated face is not 
quite well in her room and would like to see you márya dmítrievna is with 
her and she too asks you to come you are a great friend of no 
doubt she wants to send him a message said the count dear oh dear how 
happy it all was and clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count 
left the room when márya dmítrievna told natásha that anatole was married natásha did not 
wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by pierre himself sónya told 
pierre this as she led him along the corridor to room natásha pale and stern 
was sitting beside márya dmítrievna and her eyes glittering feverishly met pierre with a questioning 
look the moment he entered she did not smile or nod but only gazed fixedly 
at him and her look asked only one thing was he a friend or like 
the others an enemy in regard to anatole as for pierre he evidently did not 
exist for her knows all about it said márya dmítrievna pointing to pierre and addressing 
natásha him tell you whether i have told the truth natásha looked from one to 
the other as a hunted and wounded animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen 
ilyníchna pierre began dropping his eyes with a feeling of pity for her and loathing 
for the thing he had to do it is true or not should make no 
difference to you because it is not true that married it is true he been 
married long she asked your honor pierre gave his word of honor he still here 
she asked quickly i have just seen him she was evidently unable to speak and 
made a sign with her hands that they should leave her alone chapter xx pierre 
did not stay for dinner but left the room and went away at once he 
drove through the town seeking anatole kurágin at the thought of whom now the blood 
rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in breathing he was not at 
the ice hills nor at the nor at pierre drove to the club in the 
club all was going on as usual the members who were assembling for dinner were 
sitting about in groups they greeted pierre and spoke of the town news the footman 
having greeted him knowing his habits and his acquaintances told him there was a place 
left for him in the small dining room and that prince michael zakhárych was in 
the library but paul timoféevich had not yet arrived one of acquaintances while they were 
talking about the weather asked if he had heard of abduction of rostóva which was 
talked of in the town and was it true pierre laughed and said it was 
nonsense for he had just come from the he asked everyone about anatole one man 
told him he had not come yet and another that he was coming to dinner 
pierre felt it strange to see this calm indifferent crowd of people unaware of what 
was going on in his soul he paced through the ballroom waited till everyone had 
come and as anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove 
home anatole for whom pierre was looking dined that day with dólokhov consulting him as 
to how to remedy this unfortunate affair it seemed to him essential to see natásha 
in the evening he drove to his to discuss with her how to arrange a 
meeting when pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over moscow his valet informed him 
that prince anatole was with the countess the drawing room was full of guests pierre 
without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his that moment she was 
more repulsive to him than the drawing room and seeing anatole went up to him 
pierre said the countess going up to her husband know what a plight our anatole 
she stopped seeing in the forward thrust of her head in his glowing eyes and 
his resolute gait the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and 
had herself experienced after his duel with dólokhov you are there is vice and evil 
said pierre to his wife come with me i must speak to you he added 
in french anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively ready to follow pierre 
pierre taking him by the arm pulled him toward himself and was leading him from 
the room you allow yourself in my drawing room whispered hélène but pierre did not 
reply and went out of the room anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step 
but his face betrayed anxiety having entered his study pierre closed the door and addressed 
anatole without looking at him promised countess rostóva to marry her and were about to 
elope with her is that so cher answered anatole their whole conversation was in french 
consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone face already pale 
became distorted by fury he seized anatole by the collar of his uniform with his 
big hand and shook him from side to side till face showed a sufficient degree 
of terror i tell you that i must talk to you repeated pierre now this 
is stupid what said anatole fingering a button of his collar that had been wrenched 
loose with a bit of the cloth a scoundrel and a blackguard and i know 
what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this said pierre expressing 
himself so artificially because he was talking french he took a heavy paperweight and lifted 
it threateningly but at once put it back in its place you promise to marry 
her i think of it i never promised because pierre interrupted him you any letters 
of hers any letters he said moving toward anatole anatole glanced at him and immediately 
thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook pierre took the letter 
anatole handed him and pushing aside a table that stood in his way threw himself 
on the sofa be violent be afraid said pierre in answer to a frightened gesture 
of the letters said he as if repeating a lesson to himself he continued after 
a short pause again rising and again pacing the room you must get out of 
moscow how can i pierre continued without listening to him must never breathe a word 
of what has passed between you and countess rostóva i know i prevent your doing 
so but if you have a spark of conscience pierre paced the room several times 
in silence anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips all you must 
understand that besides your pleasure there is such a thing as other happiness and peace 
and that you are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself amuse 
yourself with women like my them you are within your rights for they know what 
you want of them they are armed against you by the same experience of debauchery 
but to promise a maid to marry her to deceive to kidnap you understand that 
it is as mean as beating an old man or a child pierre paused and 
looked at anatole no longer with an angry but with a questioning look know about 
that eh said anatole growing more confident as pierre mastered his wrath know that and 
want to he said not looking at pierre and with a slight tremor of his 
lower jaw you have used such words to and so as a man of honor 
i allow anyone to use pierre glanced at him with amazement unable to understand what 
he wanted it was tête à tête anatole continued i it satisfaction you want said 
pierre ironically could at least take back your words what if you want me to 
do as you wish eh take them back i take them back said pierre i 
ask you to forgive me pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button if you require 
money for your journey anatole smiled the expression of that base and cringing smile which 
pierre knew so well in his wife revolted him vile and heartless brood he exclaimed 
and left the room next day anatole left for petersburg chapter xxi pierre drove to 
márya to tell her of the fulfillment of her wish that kurágin should be banished 
from moscow the whole house was in a state of alarm and commotion natásha was 
very ill having as márya dmítrievna told him in secret poisoned herself the night after 
she had been told that anatole was married with some arsenic she had stealthily procured 
after swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she woke sónya and told 
her what she had done the necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she 
was now out of danger though still so weak that it was out of the 
question to move her to the country and so the countess had been sent for 
pierre saw the distracted count and sónya who had a tear stained face but he 
could not see natásha pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all 
sides gossip about the attempted abduction of rostóva he resolutely denied these rumors assuring everyone 
that nothing had happened except that his brother in law had proposed to her and 
been refused it seemed to pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole 
affair and re establish reputation he was awaiting prince return with dread and went every 
day to the old for news of him old prince bolkónski heard all the rumors 
current in the town from mademoiselle bourienne and had read the note to princess mary 
in which natásha had broken off her engagement he seemed in better spirits than usual 
and awaited his son with great impatience some days after departure pierre received a note 
from prince andrew informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see 
him as soon as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from his father note 
to princess mary breaking off her engagement mademoiselle bourienne had purloined it from princess mary 
and given it to the old prince and he heard from him the story of 
elopement with additions prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see 
him next morning pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost the same state as 
natásha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him in the 
study talking in a loud animated voice about some intrigue going on in petersburg the 
old voice and another now and then interrupted him princess mary came out to meet 
pierre she sighed looking toward the door of the room where prince andrew was evidently 
intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow but pierre saw by her face that 
she was glad both at what had happened and at the way her brother had 
taken the news of faithlessness says he expected it she remarked know his pride will 
not let him express his feelings but still he has taken it better far better 
than i expected evidently it had to be is it possible that all is really 
ended asked pierre princess mary looked at him with astonishment she did not understand how 
he could ask such a question pierre went into the study prince andrew greatly changed 
and plainly in better health but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows stood 
in civilian dress facing his father and prince meshchérski warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating the 
conversation was about news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached moscow 
he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago 
prince andrew was saying by those who were unable to understand his aims to judge 
a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of 
other mistakes is very easy but i maintain that if anything good has been accomplished 
in this reign it was done by him by him alone he paused at the 
sight of pierre his face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression will do him 
justice he concluded and at once turned to pierre how are you still getting stouter 
he said with animation but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened i am well 
he said in answer to question and smiled to pierre that smile said plainly am 
well but my health is now of no use to anyone after a few words 
to pierre about the awful roads from the polish frontier about people he had met 
in switzerland who knew pierre and about m dessalles whom he had brought from abroad 
to be his tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about speránski which 
was still going on between the two old men there were treason or proofs of 
secret relations with napoleon they would have been made public he said with warmth and 
haste do not and never did like speránski personally but i like justice pierre now 
recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too familiar to get 
excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were 
too oppressive and too intimate when prince meshchérski had left prince andrew took arm and 
asked him into the room that had been assigned him a bed had been made 
up there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about prince andrew went to one 
and took out a small casket from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper 
he did it all silently and very quickly he stood up and coughed his face 
was gloomy and his lips compressed me for troubling you pierre saw that prince andrew 
was going to speak of natásha and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy this 
expression irritated prince andrew and in a determined ringing and unpleasant tone he continued have 
received a refusal from countess rostóva and have heard reports of your brother in law 
having sought her hand or something of that kind is that true true and untrue 
pierre began but prince andrew interrupted him are her letters and her portrait said he 
he took the packet from the table and handed it to pierre this to the 
countess if you see her is very ill said pierre she is here still said 
prince andrew prince kurágin he added quickly left long ago she has been at door 
much regret her illness said prince andrew and he smiled like his father coldly maliciously 
and unpleasantly monsieur kurágin has not honored countess rostóva with his hand said prince andrew 
and he snorted several times could not marry for he was married already said pierre 
prince andrew laughed disagreeably again reminding one of his father where is your brother in 
law now if i may ask he said has gone to peters but i know 
said pierre it matter said prince andrew countess rostóva that she was and is perfectly 
free and that i wish her all that is good pierre took the packet prince 
andrew as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say or waiting 
to see if pierre would say anything looked fixedly at him say do you remember 
our discussion in petersburg asked pierre returned prince andrew hastily said that a fallen woman 
should be forgiven but i say i could forgive her i can this be compared 
said pierre prince andrew interrupted him and cried sharply ask her hand again be magnanimous 
and so on yes that would be very noble but i am unable to follow 
in that footsteps if you wish to be my friend never speak to me of 
that of all that well good by so give her the packet pierre left the 
room and went to the old prince and princess mary the old man seemed livelier 
than usual princess mary was the same as always but beneath her sympathy for her 
brother pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off looking at them 
pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the rostóvs and that it 
was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of her who could give 
up prince andrew for anyone else at dinner the talk turned on the war the 
approach of which was becoming evident prince andrew talked incessantly arguing now with his father 
now with the swiss tutor dessalles and showing an unnatural animation the cause of which 
pierre so well understood chapter xxii that same evening pierre went to the to fulfill 
the commission entrusted to him natásha was in bed the count at the club and 
pierre after giving the letters to sónya went to márya dmítrievna who was interested to 
know how prince andrew had taken the news ten minutes later sónya came to márya 
dmítrievna insists on seeing count peter kirílovich said she how are we to take him 
up to her the room there has not been tidied up she has dressed and 
gone into the drawing room said sónya márya dmítrievna only shrugged her shoulders will her 
mother come she has worried me to death now mind tell her everything said she 
to pierre the heart to scold her she is so much to be pitied so 
much to be pitied natásha was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated 
with a pale set face but not at all shamefaced as pierre expected to find 
her when he appeared at the door she grew flurried evidently undecided whether to go 
to meet him or to wait till he came up pierre hastened to her he 
thought she would give him her hand as usual but she stepping up to him 
stopped breathing heavily her arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand 
in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing but with quite 
a different expression of face kirílovich she began rapidly bolkónski was your your friend she 
corrected herself it seemed to her that everything that had once been must now be 
different told me once to apply to you pierre sniffed as he looked at her 
but did not speak till then he had reproached her in his heart and tried 
to despise her but he now felt so sorry for her that there was no 
room in his soul for reproach is here now tell him to for forgive me 
she stopped and breathed still more quickly but did not shed tears i will tell 
him answered pierre he did not know what to say natásha was evidently dismayed at 
the thought of what he might think she had meant i know all is over 
she said hurriedly that can never be only tormented by the wrong i have done 
him tell him only that i beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything 
she trembled all over and sat down on a chair a sense of pity he 
had never before known overflowed heart will tell him i will tell him everything once 
more said pierre i should like to know one thing what eyes asked should like 
to know did you love pierre did not know how to refer to anatole and 
flushed at the thought of you love that bad man call him bad said natásha 
i know know at all she began to cry and a still greater sense of 
pity tenderness and love welled up in pierre he felt the tears trickle under his 
spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed speak of it any more my dear 
said pierre and his gentle cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to natásha speak of 
it my tell him everything but one thing i beg of you consider me your 
friend and if you want help advice or simply to open your heart to now 
but when your mind is clearer think of me he took her hand and kissed 
it shall be happy if in my power pierre grew confused speak to me like 
that i am not worth it exclaimed natásha and turned to leave the room but 
pierre held her hand he knew he had something more to say to her but 
when he said it he was amazed at his own words stop you have your 
whole life before you said he to her me no all is over for me 
she replied with shame and self abasement over he repeated i were not myself but 
the handsomest cleverest and best man in the world and were free i would this 
moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love for the first time 
for many days natásha wept tears of gratitude and tenderness and glancing at pierre she 
went out of the room pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the 
anteroom restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him and without finding the sleeves 
of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh to now your 
excellency asked the coachman to pierre asked himself can i go now surely not to 
the club or to pay calls all men seemed so pitiful so poor in comparison 
with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparison with that softened grateful 
last look she had given him through her tears said pierre and despite twenty two 
degrees of frost fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and 
inhaled the air with joy it was clear and frosty above the dirty ill lit 
streets above the black roofs stretched the dark starry sky only looking up at the 
sky did pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things compared 
with the heights to which his soul had just been raised at the entrance to 
the arbát square an immense expanse of dark starry sky presented itself to his eyes 
almost in the center of it above the prechístenka boulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all 
sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its 
white light and its long uplifted tail shone the enormous and brilliant comet of comet 
which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world 
in pierre however that comet with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear 
on the contrary he gazed joyfully his eyes moist with tears at this bright comet 
which having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space seemed an arrow 
piercing the remain fixed in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tail erect shining and 
displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars it seemed to pierre that this 
comet fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul now 
blossoming into a new life book nine 1812 chapter i from the close of the 
year 1811 an intensified arming and concentrating of the forces of western europe began and 
in 1812 these of men reckoning those transporting and feeding the from the west eastwards 
to the russian frontier toward which since 1811 russian forces had been similarly drawn on 
the twelfth of june 1812 the forces of western europe crossed the russian frontier and 
war began that is an event took place opposed to human reason and to human 
nature millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes frauds treacheries thefts forgeries 
issues of false money burglaries incendiarisms and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded 
in the annals of all the law courts of the world but which those who 
committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes what produced this extraordinary 
occurrence what were its causes the historians tell us with naïve assurance that its causes 
were the wrongs inflicted on the duke of oldenburg the nonobservance of the continental system 
the ambition of napoleon the firmness of alexander the mistakes of the diplomatists and so 
on consequently it would only have been necessary for metternich rumyántsev or talleyrand between a 
levee and an evening party to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit 
note or for napoleon to have written to alexander respected brother i consent to restore 
the duchy to the duke of there would have been no war we can understand 
that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries it naturally seemed to napoleon that the 
war was caused by intrigues as in fact he said on the island of st 
helena it naturally seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the 
war was ambition to the duke of oldenburg that the cause of the war was 
the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of the war was the 
continental system which was ruining europe to the generals and old soldiers that the chief 
reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment to the legitimists of 
that day that it was the need of re establishing les bons principes and to 
the diplomatists of that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance 
between russia and austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed from napoleon and 
from the awkward wording of memorandum no 178 it is natural that these and a 
countless and infinite quantity of other reasons the number depending on the endless diversity of 
points of view presented themselves to the men of that day but to us to 
posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain 
and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficient to us it is incomprehensible that millions of 
christian men killed and tortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious or alexander was 
firm or because policy was astute or the duke of oldenburg wronged we cannot grasp 
what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because 
the duke was wronged thousands of men from the other side of europe killed and 
ruined the people of smolénsk and moscow and were killed by them to us their 
descendants who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research 
and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes 
present themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them 
we find and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally 
valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the 
events and by its from the cooperation of all the other coincident occasion the event 
to us the wish or objection of this or that french corporal to serve a 
second term appears as much a cause as refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the 
vistula and to restore the duchy of oldenburg for had he not wished to serve 
and had a second a third and a thousandth corporal and private also refused there 
would have been so many less men in army and the war could not have 
occurred had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the 
vistula and not ordered his troops to advance there would have been no war but 
had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have 
been no war nor could there have been a war had there been no english 
intrigues and no duke of oldenburg and had alexander not felt insulted and had there 
not been an autocratic government in russia or a revolution in france and a subsequent 
dictatorship and empire or all the things that produced the french revolution and so on 
without each of these causes nothing could have happened so all these of to bring 
it about and so there was no one cause for that occurrence but it had 
to occur because it had to millions of men renouncing their human feelings and reason 
had to go from west to east to slay their fellows just as some centuries 
previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west slaying their fellows 
the actions of napoleon and alexander on whose words the event seemed to hang were 
as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign 
by lot or by conscription this could not be otherwise for in order that the 
will of napoleon and alexander on whom the event seemed to depend should be carried 
out the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event 
could not have taken place it was necessary that millions of men in whose hands 
lay the real soldiers who fired or transported provisions and consent to carry out the 
will of these weak individuals and should have been induced to do so by an 
infinite number of diverse and complex causes we are forced to fall back on fatalism 
as an explanation of irrational events that is to say events the reasonableness of which 
we do not understand the more we try to explain such events in history reasonably 
the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us each man lives for himself 
using his freedom to attain his personal aims and feels with his whole being that 
he can now do or abstain from doing this or that action but as soon 
as he has done it that action performed at a certain moment in time becomes 
irrevocable and belongs to history in which it has not a free but a predestined 
significance there are two sides to the life of every man his individual life which 
is the more free the more abstract its interests and his elemental hive life in 
which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him man lives consciously for himself but 
is an unconscious instrument in the attainment of the historic universal aims of humanity a 
deed done is irrevocable and its result coinciding in time with the actions of millions 
of other men assumes an historic significance the higher a man stands on the social 
ladder the more people he is connected with and the more power he has over 
others the more evident is the predestination and inevitability of his every action heart is 
in the hands of the lord a king is slave history that is the unconscious 
general hive life of mankind uses every moment of the life of kings as a 
tool for its own purposes though napoleon at that time in 1812 was more convinced 
than ever that it depended on him verser ou ne pas verser le sang de 
ses peuples alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote had never been so 
much in the grip of inevitable laws which compelled him while thinking that he was 
acting on his own volition to perform for the hive is to say for had 
to be performed shed or not to shed the blood of his peoples the people 
of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men and by the law of 
coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and co ordinated to produce that movement and 
war reproaches for the nonobservance of the continental system the duke of wrongs the movement 
of troops into as it seemed to napoleon only for the purpose of securing an 
armed peace the french love and habit of war coinciding with his inclinations allurement by 
the grandeur of the preparations and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of 
obtaining advantages to compensate for that expenditure the intoxicating honors he received in dresden the 
diplomatic negotiations which in the opinion of contemporaries were carried on with a sincere desire 
to attain peace but which only wounded the self love of both sides and millions 
of other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or coincided with 
it when an apple has ripened and falls why does it fall because of its 
attraction to the earth because its stalk withers because it is dried by the sun 
because it grows heavier because the wind shakes it or because the boy standing below 
wants to eat it nothing is the cause all this is only the coincidence of 
conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur and the botanist who finds 
that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right 
with the child who stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he 
wanted to eat it and prayed for it equally right or wrong is he who 
says that napoleon went to moscow because he wanted to and perished because alexander desired 
his destruction and he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell 
because the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock in historic 
events the so called great men are labels giving names to events and like labels 
they have but the smallest connection with the event itself every act of theirs which 
appears to them an act of their own will is in an historical sense involuntary 
and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity chapter ii 
on the twenty ninth of may napoleon left dresden where he had spent three weeks 
surrounded by a court that included princes dukes kings and even an emperor before leaving 
napoleon showed favor to the emperor kings and princes who had deserved it reprimanded the 
kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied presented pearls and diamonds of his is 
which he had taken from other the empress of austria and having as his historian 
tells us tenderly embraced the empress marie regarded him as her husband though he had 
left another wife in her grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to 
bear though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously 
to that end and though the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander calling 
him monsieur mon frère and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and 
would always love and honor he set off to join his army and at every 
station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west to east 
he went in a traveling coach with six horses surrounded by pages aides de camp 
and an escort along the road to posen thorn danzig and königsberg at each of 
these towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm the army was moving 
from west to east and relays of six horses carried him in the same direction 
on the tenth of june coming up with the army he spent the night in 
apartments prepared for him on the estate of a polish count in the vilkavisski forest 
old style next day overtaking the army he went in a carriage to the niemen 
and changing into a polish uniform he drove to the riverbank in order to select 
a place for the crossing seeing on the other side some cossacks les cosaques and 
the wide spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow 
moscou la ville sainte the capital of a realm such as the scythia into which 
alexander the great had unexpectedly and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations ordered an 
advance and the next day his army began to cross the niemen early in the 
morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent which was pitched 
that day on the steep left bank of the niemen and looked through a spyglass 
at the streams of his troops pouring out of the vilkavisski forest and flowing over 
the three bridges thrown across the river the troops knowing of the presence were on 
the lookout for him and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat 
and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on 
the hill they threw up their caps and shouted and one after another poured in 
a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that had concealed them and separating flowed 
on and on by the three bridges to the other side go into action oh 
when he takes it in hand himself things get hot by heaven there he is 
vive so these are the steppes of asia a nasty country all the same au 
revoir beauché keep the best palace in moscow for you au revoir good luck did 
you see the emperor vive preur they make me governor of india gérard make you 
minister of settled vive hurrah hurrah hurrah the how they run vive there he is 
do you see him seen him twice as i see you now the little corporal 
i saw him give the cross to one of the veterans vive came the voices 
of men old and young of most diverse characters and social positions on the faces 
of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the long expected 
campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was 
standing on the hill on the thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse 
was brought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of 
the bridges over the niemen deafened continually by incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently 
endured only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of 
him by such shouting but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted 
him from the military cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the 
army he rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side turned 
sharply to the left and galloped in the direction of kóvno preceded by enraptured mounted 
chasseurs of the guard who breathless with delight galloped ahead to clear a path for 
him through the troops on reaching the broad river víliya he stopped near a regiment 
of polish uhlans stationed by the river shouted the poles ecstatically breaking their ranks and 
pressing against one another to see him napoleon looked up and down the river dismounted 
and sat down on a log that lay on the bank at a mute sign 
from him a telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a 
happy page who had run up to him and he gazed at the opposite bank 
then he became absorbed in a map laid out on the logs without lifting his 
head he said something and two of his aides de camp galloped off to the 
polish uhlans what did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans 
when one of the aides de camp rode up to them the order was to 
find a ford and to cross the river the colonel of the polish uhlans a 
handsome old man flushed and fumbling in his speech from excitement asked the aide de 
camp whether he would be permitted to swim the river with his uhlans instead of 
seeking a ford in evident fear of refusal like a boy asking for permission to 
get on a horse he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before 
the eyes the aide de camp replied that probably the emperor would not be displeased 
at this excess of zeal as soon as the aide de camp had said this 
the old mustached officer with happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted and 
commanding the uhlans to follow him spurred his horse and galloped into the river he 
gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grown restive under him and plunged 
into the water heading for the deepest part where the current was swift hundreds of 
uhlans galloped in after him it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in 
the middle of the stream and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they 
fell off their horses some of the horses were drowned and some of the men 
the others tried to swim on some in the saddle and some clinging to their 
manes they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and though there 
was a ford one third of a mile away were proud that they were swimming 
and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the 
log and was not even looking at what they were doing when the aide de 
camp having returned and choosing an opportune moment ventured to draw the attention to the 
devotion of the poles to his person the little man in the gray overcoat got 
up and having summoned berthier began pacing up and down the bank with him giving 
him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning uhlans who distracted his attention for 
him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the world 
from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike was enough to dumfound people and impel 
them to insane self oblivion he called for his horse and rode to his quarters 
some forty uhlans were drowned in the river though boats were sent to their assistance 
the majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started the colonel and 
some of his men got across and with difficulty clambered out on the further bank 
and as soon as they had got out in their soaked and streaming clothes they 
shouted and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he no 
longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy that evening between issuing one order 
that the forged russian paper money prepared for use in russia should be delivered as 
quickly as possible and another that a saxon should be shot on whom a letter 
containing information about the orders to the french army had been found napoleon also gave 
instructions that the polish colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled 
in the légion of which napoleon was himself the head quos vult perdere dementat those 
whom god wishes to destroy he drives mad chapter iii the emperor of russia had 
meanwhile been in vílna for more than a month reviewing troops and holding maneuvers nothing 
was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor 
had come from petersburg there was no general plan of action the vacillation between the 
various plans that were proposed had even increased after the emperor had been at headquarters 
for a month each of the three armies had its own commander in chief but 
there was no supreme commander of all the forces and the emperor did not assume 
that responsibility himself the longer the emperor remained in vílna the less did of for 
the war all the efforts of those who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to 
making him spend his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending in june after 
many balls and fetes given by the polish magnates by the courtiers and by the 
emperor himself it occurred to one of the polish aides de camp in attendance that 
a dinner and ball should be given for the emperor by his aides de camp 
this idea was eagerly received the emperor gave his consent the aides de camp collected 
money by subscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the emperor 
was invited to act as hostess count bennigsen being a landowner in the vílna province 
offered his country house for the fete and the thirteenth of june was fixed for 
a ball dinner regatta and fireworks at zakret count country seat the very day that 
napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen and his vanguard driving off the cossacks 
crossed the russian frontier alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his aides 
de camp at country house it was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such 
matters declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place countess 
bezúkhova was present among other russian ladies who had followed the sovereign from petersburg to 
vílna and eclipsed the refined polish ladies by her massive so called russian type of 
beauty the emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance borís drubetskóy having left 
his wife in moscow and being for the present en garçon as he phrased it 
was also there and though not an aide de camp had subscribed a large sum 
toward the expenses borís was now a rich man who had risen to high honors 
and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of 
those of his own age he was meeting hélène in vílna after not having seen 
her for a long time and did not recall the past but as hélène was 
enjoying the favors of a very important personage and borís had only recently married they 
met as good friends of long standing at midnight dancing was still going on hélène 
not having a suitable partner herself offered to dance the mazurka with borís they were 
the third couple borís coolly looking at dazzling bare shoulders which emerged from a dark 
gold embroidered gauze gown talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time 
unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others never for an instant ceased to observe 
the emperor who was in the same room the emperor was not dancing he stood 
in the doorway stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which he 
alone knew how to utter as the mazurka began borís saw that adjutant general balashëv 
one of those in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contrary 
to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish lady having 
finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly at balashëv and evidently understanding that he 
only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the 
lady and turned to him hardly had balashëv begun to speak before a look of 
amazement appeared on the face he took balashëv by the arm and crossed the room 
with him unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides 
made way for him borís noticed excited face when the sovereign went out with balashëv 
arakchéev looked at the emperor from under his brow and sniffing with his red nose 
stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor to address him borís understood 
that arakchéev envied balashëv and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor 
otherwise than through himself but the emperor and balashëv passed out into the illuminated garden 
without noticing arakchéev who holding his sword and glancing wrathfully around followed some twenty paces 
behind them all the time borís was going through the figures of the mazurka he 
was worried by the question of what news balashëv had brought and how he could 
find it out before others in the figure in which he had to choose two 
ladies he whispered to hélène that he meant to choose countess potocka who he thought 
had gone out onto the veranda and glided over the parquet to the door opening 
into the garden where seeing balashëv and the emperor returning to the veranda he stood 
still they were moving toward the door borís fluttering as if he had not had 
time to withdraw respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head the emperor with 
the agitation of one who has been personally affronted was finishing with these words enter 
russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long as a single armed 
enemy remains in my country it seemed to borís that it gave the emperor pleasure 
to utter these words he was satisfied with the form in which he had expressed 
his thoughts but displeased that borís had overheard it no one know of it the 
emperor added with a frown borís understood that this was meant for him and closing 
his eyes slightly bowed his head the emperor re entered the ballroom and remained there 
about another half hour borís was thus the first to learn the news that the 
french army had crossed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certain 
important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him and 
by this means he rose higher in their estimation the unexpected news of the french 
having crossed the niemen was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and at 
a ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignation and resentment the 
emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fully expressed his feelings and has since 
become famous on returning home at two that night he sent for his secretary shishkóv 
and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field 
marshal prince saltykóv in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would 
not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on russian soil next 
day the following letter was sent to napoleon monsieur mon frère yesterday i learned that 
despite the loyalty with which i have kept my engagements with your majesty your troops 
have crossed the russian frontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note 
in which count lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression that your majesty 
has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the time 
prince kurákin asked for his passports the reasons on which the duc de bassano based 
his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that 
that could serve as a pretext for aggression in fact the ambassador as he himself 
has declared was never authorized to make that demand and as soon as i was 
informed of it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered 
him to remain at his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the 
blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdraw your troops from 
russian territory i will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding 
between us will be possible in the contrary case your majesty i shall see myself 
forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked it still depends 
on your majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war i am etc 
signed alexander chapter iv at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the 
emperor having sent for balashëv and read him his letter to napoleon ordered him to 
take it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatching balashëv the emperor 
repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a 
single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told him to transmit those words to 
napoleon alexander did not insert them in his letter to napoleon because with his characteristic 
tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a 
last attempt at reconciliation was being made but he definitely instructed balashëv to repeat them 
personally to napoleon having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth accompanied by 
a bugler and two cossacks balashëv reached the french outposts at the village of rykónty 
on the russian side of the niemen by dawn there he was stopped by french 
cavalry sentinels a french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap 
shouted to the approaching balashëv to halt balashëv did not do so at once but 
continued to advance along the road at a walking pace the noncommissioned officer frowned and 
muttering words of abuse advanced his chest against balashëv put his hand to his saber 
and shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he deaf that he did not 
do as he was told balashëv mentioned who he was the noncommissioned officer began talking 
with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the russian general after living at 
the seat of the highest authority and power after conversing with the emperor less than 
three hours before and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank 
in the service balashëv found it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this 
hostile and still more this disrespectful application of brute force to himself the sun was 
only just appearing from behind the clouds the air was fresh and dewy a herd 
of cattle was being driven along the road from the village and over the fields 
the larks rose trilling one after another like bubbles rising in water balashëv looked around 
him awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village the russian cossacks and bugler 
and the french hussars looked silently at one another from time to time a french 
colonel of hussars who had evidently just left his bed came riding from the village 
on a handsome sleek gray horse accompanied by two hussars the officer the soldiers and 
their horses all looked smart and well kept it was that first period of a 
campaign when troops are still in full trim almost like that of peacetime maneuvers but 
with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety 
and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign the french colonel 
with difficulty repressed a yawn but was polite and evidently understood importance he led him 
past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be 
presented to the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the quarters were he 
believed not far off they rode through the village of rykónty past tethered french hussar 
horses past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a 
russian uniform and came out at the other end of the village the colonel said 
that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would 
receive balashëv and conduct him to his destination the sun had by now risen and 
shone gaily on the bright verdure they had hardly ridden up a hill past a 
tavern before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them in front of the 
group on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun rode a tall 
man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders he 
wore a red mantle and stretched his long legs forward in french fashion this man 
rode toward balashëv at a gallop his plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace 
glittering in the bright june sunshine balashëv was only two length from the equestrian with 
the bracelets plumes necklaces and gold embroidery who was galloping toward him with a theatrically 
solemn countenance when julner the french colonel whispered respectfully king of naples it was in 
fact murat now called of naples though it was quite incomprehensible why he should be 
king of naples he was called so and was himself convinced that he was so 
and therefore assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly he was so sure 
that he really was the king of naples that when on the eve of his 
departure from that city while walking through the streets with his wife some italians called 
out to him il re he turned to his wife with a pensive smile and 
said fellows they know that i am leaving them tomorrow live the king but though 
he firmly believed himself to be king of naples and pitied the grief felt by 
the subjects he was abandoning latterly after he had been ordered to return to military 
especially since his last interview with napoleon in danzig when his august brother in law 
had told him made you king that you should reign in my way but not 
in yours had cheerfully taken up his familiar business a well fed but not overfat 
horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the dressed up in clothes 
as variegated and expensive as possible and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of 
poland without himself knowing why or whither on seeing the russian general he threw back 
his head with its long hair curling to his shoulders in a majestically royal manner 
and looked inquiringly at the french colonel the colonel respectfully informed his majesty of mission 
whose name he could not pronounce bal machève said the king overcoming by his assurance 
the difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel to make your acquaintance general he 
added with a gesture of kingly condescension as soon as the king began to speak 
loud and fast his royal dignity instantly forsook him and without noticing it he passed 
into his natural tone of good natured familiarity he laid his hand on the withers 
of horse and said general it all looks like war as if regretting a circumstance 
of which he was unable to judge majesty replied balashëv master the emperor does not 
desire war and as your majesty sees said balashëv using the words your majesty at 
every opportunity with the affectation unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was 
still a novelty face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to de bal machève 
but royauté oblige and he felt it incumbent on him as a king and an 
ally to confer on state affairs with envoy he dismounted took arm and moving a 
few steps away from his suite which waited respectfully began to pace up and down 
with him trying to speak significantly he referred to the fact that the emperor napoleon 
had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from prussia especially when that 
demand became generally known and the dignity of france was thereby offended has its obligations 
balashëv replied that there was offensive in the demand because but murat interrupted him you 
consider the emperor alexander the aggressor he asked unexpectedly with a kindly and foolish smile 
balashëv told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of the war my 
dear general murat again interrupted him all my heart i wish the emperors may arrange 
the affair between them and that the war begun by no wish of mine may 
finish as quickly as possible said he in the tone of a servant who wants 
to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters and he went 
on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of his health and to 
reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent with him in naples then 
suddenly as if remembering his royal dignity murat solemnly drew himself up assumed the pose 
in which he had stood at his coronation and waving his right arm said detain 
you longer general i wish success to your mission and with his embroidered red mantle 
his flowing feathers and his glittering ornaments he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting 
him balashëv rode on supposing from words that he would very soon be brought before 
napoleon himself but instead of that at the next village the sentinels of infantry corps 
detained him as the pickets of the vanguard had done and an adjutant of the 
corps commander who was fetched conducted him into the village to marshal davout chapter v 
davout was to napoleon what arakchéev was to not a coward like arakchéev he was 
as precise as cruel and as unable to express his devotion to his monarch except 
by cruelty in the organism of states such men are necessary as wolves are necessary 
in the organism of nature and they always exist always appear and hold their own 
however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the head of the government may be 
this inevitability alone can explain how the cruel arakchéev who tore out a mustache with 
his own hands whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face danger and who was 
neither an educated man nor a courtier was able to maintain his powerful position with 
alexander whose own character was chivalrous noble and gentle balashëv found davout seated on a 
barrel in the shed of a hut was auditing accounts better quarters could have been 
found him but marshal davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in 
most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy for the same reason they 
are always hard at work and in a hurry can i think of the bright 
side of life when as you see i am sitting on a barrel and working 
in a dirty shed the expression of his face seemed to say the chief pleasure 
and necessity of such men when they encounter anyone who shows animation is to flaunt 
their own dreary persistent activity davout allowed himself that pleasure when balashëv was brought in 
he became still more absorbed in his task when the russian general entered and after 
glancing over his spectacles at face which was animated by the beauty of the morning 
and by his talk with murat he did not rise or even stir but scowled 
still more and sneered malevolently when he noticed in face the disagreeable impression this reception 
produced davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted thinking he could have 
been received in such a manner only because davout did not know that he was 
adjutant general to the emperor alexander and even his envoy to napoleon balashëv hastened to 
inform him of his rank and mission contrary to his expectation davout after hearing him 
became still surlier and ruder is your dispatch he inquired it to me i will 
send it to the emperor balashëv replied that he had been ordered to hand it 
personally to the emperor orders are obeyed in your army but here said davout must 
do as told and as if to make the russian general still more conscious of 
his dependence on brute force davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty 
balashëv took out the packet containing the letter and laid it on the table made 
of a door with its hinges still hanging on it laid across two barrels davout 
took the packet and read the inscription are perfectly at liberty to treat me with 
respect or not protested balashëv permit me to observe that i have the honor to 
be adjutant general to his majesty davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure 
from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on face will be treated as 
is fitting said he and putting the packet in his pocket left the shed a 
minute later the adjutant de castrès came in and conducted balashëv to the quarters assigned 
him that day he dined with the marshal at the same board on the barrels 
next day davout rode out early and after asking balashëv to come to him peremptorily 
requested him to remain there to move on with the baggage train should orders come 
for it to move and to talk to no one except monsieur de castrès after 
four days of solitude ennui and consciousness of his impotence and acute by contrast with 
the sphere of power in which he had so lately after several marches with the 
baggage and the french army which occupied the whole district balashëv was brought to occupied 
by the the very gate by which he had left it four days previously next 
day the imperial gentleman in waiting the comte de turenne came to balashëv and informed 
him of the emperor wish to honor him with an audience four days before sentinels 
of the preobrazhénsk regiment had stood in front of the house to which balashëv was 
conducted and now two french grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and 
with shaggy caps on their heads and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a 
brilliant suite of aides de camp pages and generals who were waiting for napoleon to 
come out were standing at the porch round his saddle horse and his mameluke rustan 
napoleon received balashëv in the very house in vílna from which alexander had dispatched him 
on his mission chapter vi though balashëv was used to imperial pomp he was amazed 
at the luxury and magnificence of court the comte de turenne showed him into a 
big reception room where many generals gentlemen in waiting and polish of whom balashëv had 
seen at the court of the emperor of waiting duroc said that napoleon would receive 
the russian general before going for his ride after some minutes the gentleman in waiting 
who was on duty came into the great reception room and bowing politely asked balashëv 
to follow him balashëv went into a small reception room one door of which led 
into a study the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him on 
his mission he stood a minute or two waiting he heard hurried footsteps beyond the 
door both halves of it were opened rapidly all was silent and then from the 
study the sound was heard of other steps firm and were those of napoleon he 
had just finished dressing for his ride and wore a blue uniform opening in front 
over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach white leather breeches 
tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs and hessian boots his short hair 
had evidently just been brushed but one lock hung down in the middle of his 
broad forehead his plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his 
uniform and he smelled of eau de cologne his full face rather young looking with 
its prominent chin wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome he entered briskly 
with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back his whole short 
corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding had that imposing 
and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort it was 
evident too that he was in the best of spirits that day he nodded in 
answer to low and respectful bow and coming up to him at once began speaking 
like a man who values every moment of his time and does not condescend to 
prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right 
thing and say it well day general said he have received the letter you brought 
from the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you he glanced with his 
large eyes into face and immediately looked past him it was plain that personality did 
not interest him at all evidently only what took place within his own mind interested 
him nothing outside himself had any significance for him because everything in the world it 
seemed to him depended entirely on his will do not and did not desire war 
he continued it has been forced on me even he emphasized the word am ready 
to receive any explanations you can give me and he began clearly and concisely to 
explain his reasons for dissatisfaction with the russian government judging by the calmly moderate and 
amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke balashëv was firmly persuaded that he wished 
for peace and intended to enter into negotiations when napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly 
at the russian envoy balashëv began a speech he had prepared long before the emperor 
my master but the sight of the eyes bent on him confused him are yourself 
napoleon seemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at uniform and 
sword balashëv recovered himself and began to speak he said that the emperor alexander did 
not consider demand for his passports a sufficient cause for war that kurákin had acted 
on his own initiative and without his assent that the emperor alexander did not desire 
war and had no relations with england yet interposed napoleon and as if fearing to 
give vent to his feelings he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashëv 
might proceed after saying all he had been instructed to say balashëv added that the 
emperor alexander wished for peace but would not enter into negotiations except on condition that 
here balashëv hesitated he remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his 
letter but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykóv and had told balashëv to 
repeat to napoleon balashëv remembered these words long as a single armed foe remains on 
russian soil but some complex feeling restrained him he could not utter them though he 
wished to do so he grew confused and said condition that the french army retires 
beyond the niemen napoleon noticed embarrassment when uttering these last words his face twitched and 
the calf of his left leg began to quiver rhythmically without moving from where he 
stood he began speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before during the 
speech that followed balashëv who more than once lowered his eyes involuntarily noticed the quivering 
of left leg which increased the more napoleon raised his voice desire peace no less 
than the emperor alexander he began i not for eighteen months been doing everything to 
obtain it i have waited eighteen months for explanations but in order to begin negotiations 
what is demanded of me he said frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry 
with his small white plump hand withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen sire replied 
balashëv niemen repeated napoleon now you want me to retire beyond the the niemen repeated 
napoleon looking straight at balashëv the latter bowed his head respectfully instead of the demand 
of four months earlier to withdraw from pomerania only a withdrawal beyond the niemen was 
now demanded napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room say the demand now 
is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemen before commencing negotiations but in just 
the same way two months ago the demand was that i should withdraw beyond the 
vistula and the oder and yet you are willing to negotiate he went in silence 
from one corner of the room to the other and again stopped in front of 
balashëv balashëv noticed that his left leg was quivering faster than before and his face 
seemed petrified in its stern expression this quivering of his left leg was a thing 
napoleon was conscious of vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me 
he remarked at a later date demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder 
may be made to a prince of baden but not to me napoleon almost screamed 
quite to his own surprise you gave me petersburg and moscow i could not accept 
such conditions you say i have begun this war but who first joined his army 
the emperor alexander not i and you offer me negotiations when i have expended millions 
when you are in alliance with england and when your position is a bad one 
you offer me negotiations but what is the aim of your alliance with england what 
has she given you he continued hurriedly evidently no longer trying to show the advantages 
of peace and discuss its possibility but only to prove his own rectitude and power 
and errors and duplicity the commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the 
intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that he was nevertheless willing 
to negotiate but he had begun talking and the more he talked the less could 
he control his words the whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt 
himself and insult what he had least desired at the commencement of the interview hear 
you have made peace with turkey balashëv bowed his head affirmatively has been concluded he 
began but napoleon did not let him speak he evidently wanted to do all the 
talking himself and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to 
which spoiled people are so prone i know you have made peace with the turks 
without obtaining moldavia and wallachia i would have given your sovereign those provinces as i 
gave him finland yes he went on promised and would have given the emperor alexander 
moldavia and wallachia and now he have those splendid provinces yet he might have united 
them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended russia from the 
gulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube catherine the great could not have 
done more said napoleon growing more and more excited as he paced up and down 
the room repeating to balashëv almost the very words he had used to alexander himself 
at tilsit that he would have owed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign 
he repeated several times then paused drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox lifted it 
to his nose and greedily sniffed at it a splendid reign the emperor might have 
been he looked compassionately at balashëv and as soon as the latter tried to make 
some rejoinder hastily interrupted him could he wish or look for that he would not 
have obtained through my friendship demanded napoleon shrugging his shoulders in perplexity no he has 
preferred to surround himself with my enemies and with whom with steins armfeldts bennigsens and 
wintzingerodes stein a traitor expelled from his own country armfeldt a rake and an intriguer 
wintzingerode a fugitive french subject bennigsen rather more of a soldier than the others but 
all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who 
should awaken terrible memories in the emperor mind granted that were they competent they might 
be made use of continued able to keep pace in words with the rush of 
thoughts that incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was in his perception 
the two were one and the same they are not even that they are neither 
fit for war nor peace barclay is said to be the most capable of them 
all but i cannot say so judging by his first movements and what are they 
doing all these courtiers pfuel proposes armfeldt disputes bennigsen considers and barclay called on to 
act does not know what to decide on and time passes bringing no result bagratión 
alone is a military man stupid but he has experience a quick eye and resolution 
and what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd they compromise him 
and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens a sovereign should not be 
with the army unless he is a general said napoleon evidently uttering these words as 
a direct challenge to the emperor he knew how alexander desired to be a military 
commander campaign began only a week ago and you even been able to defend vílna 
you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polish provinces your 
army is grumbling the contrary your majesty said balashëv hardly able to remember what had 
been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with difficulty troops are burning with 
eagerness know everything napoleon interrupted him know everything i know the number of your battalions 
as exactly as i know my own you have not two hundred thousand men and 
i have three times that number i give you my word of honor said napoleon 
forgetting that his word of honor could carry no give you my word of honor 
that i have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the vistula the 
turks will be of no use to you they are worth nothing and have shown 
it by making peace with you as for the is their fate to be governed 
by mad kings their king was insane and they changed him for who promptly went 
no swede would ally himself with russia unless he were mad napoleon grinned maliciously and 
again raised his snuffbox to his nose balashëv knew how to reply to each of 
remarks and would have done so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing 
to say something but napoleon always interrupted him to the alleged insanity of the swedes 
balashëv wished to reply that when russia is on her side sweden is practically an 
island but napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice napoleon was in that 
state of irritability in which a man has to talk talk and talk merely to 
convince himself that he is in the right balashëv began to feel uncomfortable as envoy 
he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a 
man he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized napoleon he 
knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon had any significance and that 
napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses balashëv stood 
with downcast eyes looking at the movements of stout legs and trying to avoid meeting 
his eyes what do i care about your allies said napoleon have poles there are 
eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions and there will be two hundred 
thousand of them and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered 
this obvious falsehood and that balashëv still stood silently before him in the same attitude 
of submission to fate napoleon abruptly turned round drew close to face and gesticulating rapidly 
and energetically with his white hands almost shouted that if you stir up prussia against 
me wipe it off the map of europe he declared his face pale and distorted 
by anger and he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other i 
will throw you back beyond the dvína and beyond the dnieper and will re erect 
against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europe to allow to 
be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you that is what you have 
gained by alienating me and he walked silently several times up and down the room 
his fat shoulders twitching he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out 
again lifted it several times to his nose and stopped in front of balashëv he 
paused looked ironically straight into eyes and said in a quiet voice yet what a 
splendid reign your master might have had balashëv feeling it incumbent on him to reply 
said that from the russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light 
napoleon was silent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him balashëv 
said that in russia the best results were expected from the war napoleon nodded condescendingly 
as if to say know your duty to say that but you believe it yourself 
i have convinced you when balashëv had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox sniffed 
at it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal the door 
opened a gentleman in waiting bending respectfully handed the emperor his hat and gloves another 
brought him a pocket handkerchief napoleon without giving them a glance turned to balashëv the 
emperor alexander from me said he taking his hat i am as devoted to him 
as before i know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities i will 
detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter to the emperor and napoleon 
went quickly to the door everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the 
staircase chapter vii after all that napoleon had said to bursts of anger and the 
last dryly spoken words will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter 
balashëv felt convinced that napoleon would not wish to see him and would even avoid 
another meeting with insulted as he had witnessed his unseemly anger but to his surprise 
balashëv received through duroc an invitation to dine with the emperor that day bessières caulaincourt 
and berthier were present at that dinner napoleon met balashëv cheerfully and amiably he not 
only showed no sign of constraint or self reproach on account of his outburst that 
morning but on the contrary tried to reassure balashëv it was evident that he had 
long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake and that 
in his perception whatever he did was right not because it harmonized with any idea 
of right and wrong but because he did it the emperor was in very good 
spirits after his ride through vílna where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed 
him from all the windows of the streets through which he rode rugs flags and 
his monogram were displayed and the polish ladies welcoming him waved their handkerchiefs to him 
at dinner having placed balashëv beside him napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved 
as if balashëv were one of his own courtiers one of those who sympathized with 
his plans and ought to rejoice at his success in the course of conversation he 
mentioned moscow and questioned balashëv about the russian capital not merely as an interested traveler 
asks about a new city he intends to visit but as if convinced that balashëv 
as a russian must be flattered by his curiosity many inhabitants are there in moscow 
how many houses is it true that moscow is called how many churches are there 
in moscow he asked and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred 
churches he remarked such a quantity of churches russians are very devout replied balashëv a 
large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a 
people said napoleon turning to caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark balashëv respectfully ventured to 
disagree with the french emperor country has its own character said he nowhere in europe 
is there anything like that said napoleon beg your pardon returned balashëv russia there is 
spain where there are also many churches and monasteries this reply of which hinted at 
the recent defeats of the french in spain was much appreciated when he related it 
at court but it was not much appreciated at dinner where it passed unnoticed the 
uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what 
tone suggested there is a point we see it or it is not at all 
witty their expressions seemed to say so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did 
not notice it at all and naïvely asked balashëv through what towns the direct road 
from there to moscow passed balashëv who was on the alert all through the dinner 
replied that just as roads lead to rome so all roads lead to moscow there 
were many roads and them the road through poltáva which charles xii chose balashëv involuntarily 
flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had he uttered the 
word poltáva before caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from petersburg to 
moscow and of his petersburg reminiscences after dinner they went to drink coffee in study 
which four days previously had been that of the emperor alexander napoleon sat down toying 
with his sèvres coffee cup and motioned balashëv to a chair beside him napoleon was 
in that well known after dinner mood which more than any reasoned cause makes a 
man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend it seemed to him 
that he was surrounded by men who adored him and he felt convinced that after 
his dinner balashëv too was his friend and worshiper napoleon turned to him with a 
pleasant though slightly ironic smile tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied 
strange it general he said evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to 
his hearer since it went to prove his superiority to alexander balashëv made no reply 
and bowed his head in silence four days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein 
were deliberating continued napoleon with the same derisive and self confident smile i understand he 
went on that the emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies that i 
do not understand has he not thought that i may do the same and he 
turned inquiringly to balashëv and evidently this thought turned him back on to the track 
of his anger which was still fresh in him let him know that i will 
do so said napoleon rising and pushing his cup away with his hand drive all 
his württemberg baden and weimar relations out of germany yes drive them out let him 
prepare an asylum for them in russia balashëv bowed his head with an air indicating 
that he would like to make his bow and leave and only listened because he 
could not help hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression 
he treated balashëv not as an envoy from his enemy but as a man now 
fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former humiliation why has the 
emperor alexander taken command of the armies what is the good of that war is 
my profession but his business is to reign and not to command armies why has 
he taken on himself such a responsibility again napoleon brought out his snuffbox paced several 
times up and down the room in silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up 
to balashëv and with a slight smile as confidently quickly and simply as if he 
were doing something not merely important but pleasing to balashëv he raised his hand to 
the forty year old russian face and taking him by the ear pulled it gently 
smiling with his lips only to have ear pulled by the emperor was considered the 
greatest honor and mark of favor at the french court adorer and courtier of the 
emperor alexander why you say anything said he as if it was ridiculous in his 
presence to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself napoleon the horses ready 
for the general he added with a slight inclination of his head in reply to 
bow him have mine he has a long way to go the letter taken by 
balashëv was the last napoleon sent to alexander every detail of the interview was communicated 
to the russian monarch and the war began chapter viii after his interview with pierre 
in moscow prince andrew went to petersburg on business as he told his family but 
really to meet anatole kurágin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reaching petersburg 
he inquired for kurágin but the latter had already left the city pierre had warned 
his brother in law that prince andrew was on his track anatole kurágin promptly obtained 
an appointment from the minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia 
while in petersburg prince andrew met kutúzov his former commander who was always well disposed 
toward him and kutúzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in moldavia 
to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief so prince andrew having 
received an appointment on the headquarters staff left for turkey prince andrew did not think 
it proper to write and challenge kurágin he thought that if he challenged him without 
some fresh cause it might compromise the young countess rostóva and so he wanted to 
meet kurágin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel but he 
again failed to meet kurágin in turkey for soon after prince andrew arrived the latter 
returned to russia in a new country amid new conditions prince andrew found life easier 
to bear after his betrothed had broken faith with he felt the more acutely the 
more he tried to conceal its surroundings in which he had been happy became trying 
to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still 
more so not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come 
to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of austerlitz and 
had later enlarged upon with pierre and which had filled his solitude at boguchárovo and 
then in switzerland and rome but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright 
and boundless horizons they had revealed he was now concerned only with the nearest practical 
matters unrelated to his past interests and he seized on these the more eagerly the 
more those past interests were closed to him it was as if that lofty infinite 
canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly turned into a low 
solid vault that weighed him down in which all was clear but nothing eternal or 
mysterious of the activities that presented themselves to him army service was the simplest and 
most familiar as a general on duty on staff he applied himself to business with 
zeal and perseverance and surprised kutúzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not having 
found kurágin in turkey prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to 
russia after him but all the same he knew that however long it might be 
before he met kurágin despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he 
deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with knew 
that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him 
out any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food and the consciousness 
that the insult was not yet avenged that his rancor was still unspent weighed on 
his heart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in turkey by 
means of restless plodding and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity in the year 1812 when 
news of the war with napoleon reached kutúzov had been living for two months passing 
his days and nights with a wallachian andrew asked kutúzov to transfer him to the 
western army kutúzov who was already weary of activity which seemed to reproach his own 
idleness very readily let him go and gave him a mission to barclay de tolly 
before joining the western army which was then in may encamped at drissa prince andrew 
visited bald hills which was directly on his way being only two miles off the 
smolénsk highroad during the last three years there had been so many changes in his 
life he had thought felt and seen so much having traveled both in the east 
and the west that on reaching bald hills it struck him as strange and unexpected 
to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail 
he entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading 
to the house as if he were entering an enchanted sleeping castle the same old 
stateliness the same cleanliness the same stillness reigned there and inside there was the same 
furniture the same walls sounds and smell and the same timid faces only somewhat older 
princess mary was still the same timid plain maiden getting on in years uselessly and 
joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering mademoiselle bourienne 
was the same coquettish self satisfied girl enjoying every moment of her existence and full 
of joyous hopes for the future she had merely become more self confident prince andrew 
thought dessalles the tutor he had brought from switzerland was wearing a coat of russian 
cut and talking broken russian to the servants but was still the same narrowly intelligent 
conscientious and pedantic preceptor the old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss 
of a tooth which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth in 
character he was the same as ever only showing still more irritability and skepticism as 
to what was happening in the world little nicholas alone had changed he had grown 
become rosier had curly dark hair and when merry and laughing quite unconsciously lifted the 
upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do 
he alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted sleeping castle but 
though externally all remained as of old the inner relations of all these people had 
changed since prince andrew had seen them last the household was divided into two alien 
and hostile camps who changed their habits for his sake and only met because he 
was there to the one camp belonged the old prince mademoiselle bourienne and the architect 
to the other princess mary dessalles little nicholas and all the old nurses and maids 
during his stay at bald hills all the family dined together but they were ill 
at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an 
exception was being made and that his presence made them all feel awkward involuntarily feeling 
this at dinner on the first day he was taciturn and the old prince noticing 
this also became morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner in the 
evening when prince andrew went to him and trying to rouse him began to tell 
him of the young count campaign the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about princess 
mary blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne who he said 
was the only person really attached to him the old prince said that if he 
was ill it was only because of princess mary that she purposely worried and irritated 
him and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas the 
old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was 
very hard but he also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that 
she deserved it does prince andrew who sees this say nothing to me about his 
sister does he think me a scoundrel or an old fool who without any reason 
keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this frenchwoman to himself he understand 
so i must explain it and he must hear me out thought the old prince 
and he began explaining why he could not put up with his unreasonable character you 
ask me said prince andrew without looking up he was censuring his father for the 
first time in his life did not wish to speak about it but as you 
ask me i will give you my frank opinion if there is any misunderstanding and 
discord between you and mary i blame her for it at all i know how 
she loves and respects you since you ask me continued prince andrew becoming he was 
always liable to do of can only say that if there are any misunderstandings they 
are caused by that worthless woman who is not fit to be my companion the 
old man at first stared fixedly at his son and an unnatural smile disclosed the 
fresh gap between his teeth to which prince andrew could not get accustomed companion my 
dear boy eh already been talking it over eh i did not want to judge 
said prince andrew in a hard and bitter tone you challenged me and i have 
said and always shall say that mary is not to blame but those to one 
to that frenchwoman he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man in a 
low voice and as it seemed to prince andrew with some embarrassment but then he 
suddenly jumped up and cried off be off let not a trace of you remain 
here prince andrew wished to leave at once but princess mary persuaded him to stay 
another day that day he did not see his father who did not leave his 
room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne and tíkhon but asked several times whether 
his son had gone next day before leaving prince andrew went to his rooms the 
boy curly headed like his mother and glowing with health sat on his knee and 
prince andrew began telling him the story of bluebeard but fell into a reverie without 
finishing the story he thought not of this pretty child his son whom he held 
on his knee but of himself he sought in himself either remorse for having angered 
his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on 
bad terms with him and was horrified to find neither what meant still more to 
him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for 
his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him 
on his knee go on said his son prince andrew without replying put him down 
from his knee and went out of the room as soon as prince andrew had 
given up his daily occupations and especially on returning to the old conditions of life 
amid which he had been happy weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity 
and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon 
as possible decided to go andrew asked his sister god that i can replied prince 
andrew am very sorry you do you say that replied princess mary do you say 
that when you are going to this terrible war and he is so old mademoiselle 
bourienne says he has been asking about you as soon as she began to speak 
of that her lips trembled and her tears began to fall prince andrew turned away 
and began pacing the room my god my god when one thinks who and cause 
people misery he said with a malignity that alarmed princess mary she understood that when 
speaking of he referred not only to mademoiselle bourienne the cause of her misery but 
also to the man who had ruined his own happiness one thing i beg i 
entreat of you she said touching his elbow and looking at him with eyes that 
shone through her tears understand she looked down imagine that sorrow is the work of 
men men are his tools she looked a little above prince head with the confident 
accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs is 
sent by him not by men men are his instruments they are not to blame 
if you think someone has wronged you forget it and forgive we have no right 
to punish and then you will know the happiness of forgiving i were a woman 
i would do so mary that is a virtue but a man should not and 
cannot forgive and forget he replied and though till that moment he had not been 
thinking of kurágin all his unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart mary is 
already persuading me to forgive it means that i ought long ago to have punished 
him he thought and giving her no further reply he began thinking of the glad 
vindictive moment when he would meet kurágin who he knew was now in the army 
princess mary begged him to stay one day more saying that she knew how unhappy 
her father would be if andrew left without being reconciled to him but prince andrew 
replied that he would probably soon be back again from the army and would certainly 
write to his father but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their 
differences would become by andrew remember that misfortunes come from god and men are never 
to blame were the last words he heard from his sister when he took leave 
of her it must be so thought prince andrew as he drove out of the 
avenue from the house at bald hills poor innocent creature is left to be victimized 
by an old man who has outlived his wits the old man feels he is 
guilty but cannot change himself my boy is growing up and rejoices in life in 
which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived and i am off to 
the army why i myself know i want to meet that man whom i despise 
so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me these conditions 
of life had been the same before but then they were all connected while now 
they had all tumbled to pieces only senseless things lacking coherence presented themselves one after 
another to prince mind chapter ix prince andrew reached the general headquarters of the army 
at the end of june the first army with which was the emperor occupied the 
fortified camp at drissa the second army was retreating trying to effect a junction with 
the first one from which it was said to be cut off by large french 
forces everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of affairs in the russian army but 
no one anticipated any danger of invasion of the russian provinces and no one thought 
the war would extend farther than the western the polish provinces prince andrew found barclay 
de tolly to whom he had been assigned on the bank of the drissa as 
there was not a single town or large village in the vicinity of the camp 
the immense number of generals and courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best 
houses of the villages on both sides of the river over a radius of six 
miles barclay de tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the emperor he received bolkónski 
stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he would mention him 
to the emperor for a decision as to his employment but asked him meanwhile to 
remain on his staff anatole kurágin whom prince andrew had hoped to find with the 
army was not there he had gone to petersburg but prince andrew was glad to 
hear this his mind was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting 
a gigantic war and he was glad to be free for a while from the 
distraction caused by the thought of kurágin during the first four days while no duties 
were required of him prince andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and by the 
aid of his own knowledge and by talks with experts tried to form a definite 
opinion about it but the question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for 
him undecided already from his military experience and what he had seen in the austrian 
campaign he had come to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans 
have no significance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of the cannot 
be met and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled to clear 
up this last point for himself prince andrew utilizing his position and acquaintances tried to 
fathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and parties 
engaged in it and he deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs 
while the emperor had still been at vílna the forces had been divided into three 
armies first the army under barclay de tolly secondly the army under bagratión and thirdly 
the one commanded by tormásov the emperor was with the first army but not as 
commander in chief in the orders issued it was stated not that the emperor would 
take command but only that he would be with the army the emperor moreover had 
with him not a commander in staff but the imperial headquarters staff in attendance on 
him was the head of the imperial staff quartermaster general prince volkónski as well as 
generals imperial aides de camp diplomatic officials and a large number of foreigners but not 
the army staff besides these there were in attendance on the emperor without any definite 
appointments arakchéev the ex minister of war count bennigsen the senior general in rank the 
grand duke tsarévich constantine pávlovich count rumyántsev the chancellor stein a former prussian minister armfeldt 
a swedish general pfuel the chief author of the plan of campaign paulucci an adjutant 
general and sardinian émigré many others though these men had no military appointment in the 
army their position gave them influence and often a corps commander or even the commander 
in chief did not know in what capacity he was questioned by bennigsen the grand 
duke arakchéev or prince volkónski or was given this or that advice and did not 
know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated from the man 
who gave it or from the emperor and whether it had to be executed or 
not but this was only the external condition the essential significance of the presence of 
the emperor and of all these people from a point of view and in an 
vicinity all became courtiers was clear to everyone it was this the emperor did not 
assume the title of commander in chief but disposed of all the armies the men 
around him were his assistants arakchéev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted 
as the bodyguard bennigsen was a landlord in the vílna province who appeared to be 
doing the honors of the district but was in reality a good general useful as 
an adviser and ready at hand to replace barclay the grand duke was there because 
it suited him to be the ex minister stein was there because his advice was 
useful and the emperor alexander held him in high esteem personally armfeldt virulently hated napoleon 
and was a general full of self confidence a quality that always influenced alexander paulucci 
was there because he was bold and decided in speech the adjutants general were there 
because they always accompanied the emperor and lastly and chiefly pfuel was there because he 
had drawn up the plan of campaign against napoleon and having induced alexander to believe 
in the efficacy of that plan was directing the whole business of the war with 
pfuel was wolzogen who expressed thoughts in a more comprehensible way than pfuel himself who 
was a harsh bookish theorist self confident to the point of despising everyone else was 
able to do besides these russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected ideas every 
the foreigners who did so with a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country 
not their were many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals were there among 
the opinions and voices in this immense restless brilliant and proud sphere prince andrew noticed 
the following sharply defined subdivisions of tendencies and parties the first party consisted of pfuel 
and his theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable of oblique movements 
outflankings and so forth pfuel and his adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of 
the country in accordance with precise laws defined by a pseudo theory of war and 
they saw only barbarism ignorance or evil intention in every deviation from that theory to 
this party belonged the foreign nobles wolzogen wintzingerode and others chiefly germans the second party 
was directly opposed to the first one extreme as always happens was met by representatives 
of the other the members of this party were those who had demanded an advance 
from vílna into poland and freedom from all prearranged plans besides being advocates of bold 
action this section also represented nationalism which made them still more one sided in the 
dispute they were russians bagratión ermólov who was beginning to come to the front and 
others at that time a famous joke of was being circulated that as a great 
favor he had petitioned the emperor to make him a german the men of that 
party remembering suvórov said that what one had to do was not to reason or 
stick pins into maps but to fight beat the enemy keep him out of russia 
and not let the army get discouraged to the third which the emperor had most 
the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two the members of this 
party chiefly civilians and to whom arakchéev belonged thought and said what men who have 
no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say they said that undoubtedly 
war particularly against such a genius as bonaparte they called him bonaparte now needs most 
deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect pfuel was a genius 
but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often 
one sided and therefore one should not trust them absolutely but should also listen to 
what opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say and then choose 
a middle course they insisted on the retention of the camp at drissa according to 
plan but on changing the movements of the other armies though by this course neither 
one aim nor the other could be attained yet it seemed best to the adherents 
of this third party of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the tsarévich 
who could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz where he had ridden out at the 
head of the guards in his casque and cavalry uniform as to a review expecting 
to crush the french gallantly but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly 
escaped amid the general confusion the men of this party had both the quality and 
the defect of frankness in their opinions they feared napoleon recognized his strength and their 
own weakness and frankly said so they said but sorrow shame and ruin will come 
of all this we have abandoned vílna and vítebsk and shall abandon drissa the only 
reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible before we 
are turned out of petersburg this view was very general in the upper army circles 
and found support also in petersburg and from the chancellor rumyántsev who for other reasons 
of state was in favor of peace the fifth party consisted of those who were 
adherents of barclay de tolly not so much as a man but as minister of 
war and commander in chief he what he they always began like that is an 
honest practical man and we have nobody better give him real power for war cannot 
be conducted successfully without unity of command and he will show what he can do 
as he did in finland if our army is well organized and strong and has 
withdrawn to drissa without suffering any defeats we owe this entirely to barclay if barclay 
is now to be superseded by bennigsen all will be lost for bennigsen showed his 
incapacity already in 1807 the sixth party the bennigsenites said on the contrary that at 
any rate there was no one more active and experienced than bennigsen twist about as 
you may you will have to come to bennigsen eventually let the others make mistakes 
now said they arguing that our retirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse and 
an unbroken series of blunders more mistakes that are made the better it will at 
any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this what 
is wanted is not some barclay or other but a man like bennigsen who made 
his mark in 1807 and to whom napoleon himself did man whose authority would be 
willingly recognized and bennigsen is the only such man the seventh party consisted of the 
sort of people who are always to be found especially around young sovereigns and of 
whom there were particularly many round and imperial aides de camp passionately devoted to the 
emperor not merely as a monarch but as a man adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly 
as rostóv had done in 1805 and who saw in him not only all the 
virtues but all human capabilities as well these men though enchanted with the sovereign for 
refusing the command of the army yet blamed him for such excessive modesty and only 
desired and insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that 
he would place himself at the head of the army gather round him a commander 
in staff and consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary would himself lead the 
troops whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest pitch the eighth and largest 
group which in its enormous numbers was to the others as ninety nine to one 
consisted of men who desired neither peace nor war neither an advance nor a defensive 
camp at the drissa or anywhere else neither barclay nor the emperor neither pfuel nor 
bennigsen but only the one most essential much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible 
in the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the headquarters it 
was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times a man who simply 
wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with pfuel tomorrow with his opponent 
and the day after merely to avoid responsibility or to please the emperor would declare 
that he had no opinion at all on the matter another who wished to gain 
some advantage would attract the attention by loudly advocating the very thing the emperor had 
hinted at the day before and would dispute and shout at the council beating his 
breast and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels thereby proving that 
he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good a third in the absence 
of opponents between two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services 
well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him a 
fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the eye a fifth 
to achieve his long cherished aim of dining with the emperor would stubbornly insist on 
the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce 
arguments more or less forcible and correct all the men of this party were fishing 
for rubles decorations and promotions and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial 
favor and directly they noticed it turning in any direction this whole drone population of 
the army began blowing hard that way so that it was all the harder for 
the emperor to turn it elsewhere amid the uncertainties of the position with the menace 
of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything amid this vortex of intrigue 
egotism conflict of views and feelings and the diversity of race among these eighth and 
largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the 
common task whatever question arose a swarm of these drones without having finished their buzzing 
on a previous theme flew over to the new one and by their hum drowned 
and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly from among all these parties 
just at the time prince andrew reached the army another a ninth party was being 
formed and was beginning to raise its voice this was the party of the elders 
reasonable men experienced and capable in state affairs who without sharing any of those conflicting 
opinions were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the 
staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this muddle indecision intricacy and 
weakness the men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted chiefly 
from the presence in the army with his military court and from the consequent presence 
there of an indefinite conditional and unsteady fluctuation of relations which is in place at 
court but harmful in an army that a sovereign should reign but not command the 
army and that the only way out of the position would be for the emperor 
and his court to leave the army that the mere presence of the emperor paralyzed 
the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his personal safety and that the 
worst commander in chief if independent would be better than the very best one trammeled 
by the presence and authority of the monarch just at the time prince andrew was 
living unoccupied at drissa shishkóv the secretary of state and one of the chief representatives 
of this party wrote a letter to the emperor which arakchéev and balashëv agreed to 
sign in this letter availing himself of permission given him by the emperor to discuss 
the general course of affairs he respectfully the plea that it was necessary for the 
sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the the emperor should leave 
the army that arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them 
to defend their very incitement which was the chief cause of triumph in so far 
as it was produced by the personal presence in suggested to the emperor and accepted 
by him as a pretext for quitting the army chapter x this letter had not 
yet been presented to the emperor when barclay one day at dinner informed bolkónski that 
the sovereign wished to see him personally to question him about turkey and that prince 
andrew was to present himself at quarters at six that evening news was received at 
the quarters that very day of a fresh movement by napoleon which might endanger the 
subsequently found to be false and that morning colonel michaud had ridden round the drissa 
fortifications with the emperor and had pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed 
by pfuel and till then considered a chef of tactical science which would ensure destruction 
was an absurdity threatening the destruction of the russian army prince andrew arrived at country 
house of moderate size situated on the very banks of the river neither bennigsen nor 
the emperor was there but chernýshev the aide de camp received bolkónski and informed him 
that the emperor accompanied by general bennigsen and marquis paulucci had gone a second time 
that day to inspect the fortifications of the drissa camp of the suitability of which 
serious doubts were beginning to be felt chernýshev was sitting at a window in the 
first room with a french novel in his hand this room had probably been a 
music room there was still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled 
and in one corner stood the folding bedstead of adjutant this adjutant was also there 
and sat dozing on the rolled up bedding evidently exhausted by work or by feasting 
two doors led from the room one straight on into what had been the drawing 
room and another on the right to the study through the first door came the 
sound of voices conversing in german and occasionally in french in that drawing room were 
gathered by the wish not a military council the emperor preferred indefiniteness but certain persons 
whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending difficulties it was not 
a council of war but as it were a council to elucidate certain questions for 
the emperor personally to this semicouncil had been invited the swedish general armfeldt adjutant general 
wolzogen wintzingerode whom napoleon had referred to as a renegade french subject michaud toll count 
stein who was not a military man at all and pfuel himself who as prince 
andrew had heard was the mainspring of the whole affair prince andrew had an opportunity 
of getting a good look at him for pfuel arrived soon after himself and in 
passing through to the drawing room stopped a minute to speak to chernýshev at first 
sight pfuel in his ill made uniform of a russian general which fitted him badly 
like a fancy costume seemed familiar to prince andrew though he saw him now for 
the first time there was about him something of weyrother mack and schmidt and many 
other german theorist generals whom prince andrew had seen in 1805 but he was more 
typical than any of them prince andrew had never yet seen a german theorist in 
whom all the characteristics of those others were united to such an extent pfuel was 
short and very thin but broad boned of coarse robust build broad in the hips 
and with prominent shoulder blades his face was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set 
his hair had evidently been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples but stuck 
up behind in quaint little tufts he entered the room looking restlessly and angrily around 
as if afraid of everything in that large apartment awkwardly holding up his sword he 
addressed chernýshev and asked in german where the emperor was one could see that he 
wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible finish with the bows and 
greetings and sit down to business in front of a map where he would feel 
at home he nodded hurriedly in reply to chernýshev and smiled ironically on hearing that 
the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he pfuel had planned in accord with his 
theory he muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice as self assured 
germans might have been or whole affair will be ruined or absurd will come of 
it prince andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on but 
chernýshev introduced him to pfuel remarking that prince andrew was just back from turkey where 
the war had terminated so fortunately pfuel barely so much at prince andrew as past 
said with a laugh must have been a fine tactical and laughing contemptuously went on 
into the room from which the sound of voices was heard pfuel always inclined to 
be irritably sarcastic was particularly disturbed that day evidently by the fact that they had 
dared to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence from this short interview with 
pfuel prince andrew thanks to his austerlitz experiences was able to form a clear conception 
of the man pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably self confident men self 
confident to the point of martyrdom as only germans are because only germans are self 
confident on the basis of an abstract that is the supposed knowledge of absolute truth 
a frenchman is self assured because he regards himself personally both in mind and body 
as irresistibly attractive to men and women an englishman is self assured as being a 
citizen of the best organized state in the world and therefore as an englishman always 
knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an englishman is 
undoubtedly correct an italian is self assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself 
and other people a russian is self assured just because he knows nothing and does 
not want to know anything since he does not believe that anything can be known 
the self assurance is worst of all stronger and more repulsive than any other because 
he imagines that he knows the he himself has invented but which is for him 
the absolute truth pfuel was evidently of that sort he had a theory of oblique 
movements deduced by him from the history of frederick the wars and all he came 
across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and collisions in 
which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be 
called wars they did not accord with the theory and therefore could not serve as 
material for science in 1806 pfuel had been one of those responsible for the plan 
of campaign that ended in jena and auerstädt but he did not see the least 
proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war on the 
contrary the deviations made from his theory were in his opinion the sole cause of 
the whole disaster and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark i said the whole 
affair would go to the devil pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love 
their theory that they lose sight of the practical application his love of theory made 
him hate everything practical and he would not listen to it he was even pleased 
by failures for failures resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to 
him the accuracy of his theory he said a few words to prince andrew and 
chernýshev about the present war with the air of a man who knows beforehand that 
all will go wrong and who is not displeased that it should be so the 
unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples 
expressed this most eloquently he passed into the next room and the deep querulous sounds 
of his voice were at once heard from there chapter xi prince eyes were still 
following pfuel out of the room when count bennigsen entered hurriedly and nodding to bolkónski 
but not pausing went into the study giving instructions to his adjutant as he went 
the emperor was following him and bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and 
to be ready to receive the sovereign chernýshev and prince andrew went out into the 
porch where the emperor who looked fatigued was dismounting marquis paulucci was talking to him 
with particular warmth and the emperor with his head bent to the left was listening 
with a dissatisfied air the emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation but 
the flushed and excited italian oblivious of decorum followed him and continued to speak as 
for the man who advised forming this drissa camp said paulucci as the emperor mounted 
the steps and noticing prince andrew scanned his unfamiliar face to that person sire continued 
paulucci desperately apparently unable to restrain himself man who advised the drissa see no alternative 
but the lunatic asylum or the gallows without heeding the end of the remarks and 
as though not hearing them the emperor recognizing bolkónski addressed him graciously am very glad 
to see you go in there where they are meeting and wait for me the 
emperor went into the study he was followed by prince peter mikháylovich volkónski and baron 
stein and the door closed behind them prince andrew taking advantage of the permission accompanied 
paulucci whom he had known in turkey into the drawing room where the council was 
assembled prince peter mikháylovich volkónski occupied the position as it were of chief of the 
staff he came out of the study into the drawing room with some maps which 
he spread on a table and put questions on which he wished to hear the 
opinion of the gentlemen present what had happened was that news which afterwards proved to 
be false had been received during the night of a movement by the french to 
outflank the drissa camp the first to speak was general armfeldt who to meet the 
difficulty that presented itself unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the petersburg and 
moscow roads the reason for this was inexplicable unless he wished to show that he 
too could have an opinion but he urged that at this point the army should 
unite and there await the enemy it was plain that armfeldt had thought out that 
plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions in 
fact his plan did not to avail himself of the opportunity to air it it 
was one of the millions of proposals one as good as another that could be 
made as long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take some 
disputed his arguments others defended them young count toll objected to the swedish views more 
warmly than anyone else and in the course of the dispute drew from his side 
pocket a well filled notebook which he asked permission to read to them in these 
voluminous notes toll suggested another scheme totally different from or plan of campaign in answer 
to toll paulucci suggested an advance and an attack which he urged could alone extricate 
us from the present uncertainty and from the trap as he called the drissa camp 
in which we were situated during all these discussions pfuel and his interpreter wolzogen his 
in court relations were silent pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away to show that 
he would never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing 
so when prince volkónski who was in the chair called on him to give his 
opinion he merely said ask me general armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an 
exposed rear or why not this italian fine or a retreat also good why ask 
me said he you yourselves know everything better than i do but when volkónski said 
with a frown that it was in the name that he asked his opinion pfuel 
rose and suddenly growing animated began to speak has been spoiled everything muddled everybody thought 
they knew better than i did and now you come to me how mend matters 
there is nothing to mend the principles laid down by me must be strictly adhered 
to said he drumming on the table with his bony fingers is the difficulty nonsense 
childishness he went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no eventuality 
could alter the efficiency of the drissa camp that everything had been foreseen and that 
if the enemy were really going to outflank it the enemy would inevitably be destroyed 
paulucci who did not know german began questioning him in french wolzogen came to the 
assistance of his chief who spoke french badly and began translating for him hardly able 
to keep pace with pfuel who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had 
happened but all that could happen had been foreseen in his scheme and that if 
there were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan 
had not been precisely executed he kept laughing sarcastically he demonstrated and at last contemptuously 
ceased to demonstrate like a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy 
of a problem that has already been proved wolzogen took his place and continued to 
explain his views in french every now and then turning to pfuel and saying it 
not so your excellency but pfuel like a man heated in a fight who strikes 
those on his own side shouted angrily at his own supporter wolzogen of course what 
more is there to explain paulucci and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in french armfeldt 
addressed pfuel in german toll explained to volkónski in russian prince andrew listened and observed 
in silence of all these men prince andrew sympathized most with pfuel angry determined and 
absurdly self confident as he was of all those present evidently he alone was not 
seeking anything for himself nursed no hatred against anyone and only desired that the plan 
formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil should be carried out he 
was ridiculous and unpleasantly sarcastic but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion 
to an idea besides this the remarks of all except pfuel had one common trait 
that had not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805 there was now 
a panic fear of genius which though concealed was noticeable in every rejoinder everything was 
assumed to be possible for napoleon they expected him from every side and invoked his 
terrible name to shatter each proposals pfuel alone seemed to consider napoleon a barbarian like 
everyone else who opposed his theory but besides this feeling of respect pfuel evoked pity 
in prince andrew from the tone in which the courtiers addressed him and the way 
paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the emperor but above all from 
a certain desperation in own expressions it was clear that the others knew and pfuel 
himself felt that his fall was at hand and despite his self confidence and grumpy 
german sarcasm he was pitiable with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking 
up in tufts behind though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and 
contempt he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory 
by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world was slipping away 
from him the discussions continued a long time and the longer they lasted the more 
heated became the disputes culminating in shouts and personalities and the less was it possible 
to arrive at any general conclusion from all that had been said prince andrew listening 
to this polyglot talk and to these surmises plans refutations and shouts felt nothing but 
amazement at what they were saying a thought that had long since and often occurred 
to him during his military idea that there is not and cannot be any science 
of war and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military appeared 
to him an obvious truth theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions 
and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined especially when the strength of 
the acting forces cannot be ascertained no one was or is able to foresee in 
what condition our or the armies will be in a time and no one can 
gauge the force of this or that detachment there is not a coward at the 
front to shout are cut off and start running but a brave and jolly lad 
who shouts detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand as at schön grabern while 
at times fifty thousand run from eight thousand as at austerlitz what science can there 
be in a matter in which as in all practical matters nothing can be defined 
and everything depends on innumerable conditions the significance of which is determined at a particular 
moment which arrives no one knows when armfeldt says our army is cut in half 
and paulucci says we have got the french army between two fires michaud says that 
the worthlessness of the drissa camp lies in having the river behind it and pfuel 
says that is what constitutes its strength toll proposes one plan armfeldt another and they 
are all good and all bad and the advantages of any suggestions can be seen 
only at the moment of trial and why do they all speak of a is 
a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right 
time and say who is to go to the right and who to the left 
it is only because military men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of 
sychophants flatter power attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess the best 
generals i have known were on the contrary stupid or absent minded men bagratión was 
the best napoleon himself admitted that and of bonaparte himself i remember his limited self 
satisfied face on the field of austerlitz not only does a good army commander not 
need any special qualities on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and 
best human poetry tenderness and philosophic inquiring doubt he should be limited firmly convinced that 
what he is doing is very important otherwise he will not have sufficient patience and 
only then will he be a brave leader god forbid that he should be humane 
should love or pity or think of what is just and unjust it is understandable 
that a theory of their was invented for them long ago because they have power 
the success of a military action depends not on them but on the man in 
the ranks who shouts are lost or who shouts and only in the ranks can 
one serve with assurance of being useful so thought prince andrew as he listened to 
the talking and he roused himself only when paulucci called him and everyone was leaving 
at the review next day the emperor asked prince andrew where he would like to 
serve and prince andrew lost his standing in court circles forever by not asking to 
remain attached to the person but for permission to serve in the army chapter xii 
before the beginning of the campaign rostóv had received a letter from his parents in 
which they told him briefly of illness and the breaking off of her engagement to 
prince andrew which they explained by having rejected him and again asked nicholas to retire 
from the army and return home on receiving this letter nicholas did not even make 
any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the army but wrote 
to his parents that he was sorry natásha was ill and her engagement broken off 
and that he would do all he could to meet their wishes to sónya he 
wrote separately friend of my soul he wrote but honor could keep me from returning 
to the country but now at the commencement of the campaign i should feel dishonored 
not only in my eyes but in my own if i preferred my own happiness 
to my love and duty to the fatherland but this shall be our last separation 
believe me directly the war is over if i am still alive and still loved 
by you i will throw up everything and fly to you to press you forever 
to my ardent breast it was in fact only the commencement of the campaign that 
prevented rostóv from returning home as he had promised and marrying sónya the autumn in 
otrádnoe with the hunting and the winter with the christmas holidays and love had opened 
out to him a vista of tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had 
never known before and which now allured him splendid wife children a good pack of 
hounds a dozen leashes of smart borzois agriculture neighbors service by election thought he but 
now the campaign was beginning and he had to remain with his regiment and since 
it had to be so nicholas rostóv as was natural to him felt contented with 
the life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that 
life on his return from his furlough nicholas having been joyfully welcomed by his comrades 
was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the ukraine excellent horses which pleased 
him and earned him commendation from his commanders during his absence he had been promoted 
captain and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers 
he was again allotted his old squadron the campaign began the regiment was moved into 
poland on double pay new officers arrived new men and horses and above all everybody 
was infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement of a war 
and rostóv conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment devoted himself entirely to the 
pleasures and interests of military service though he knew that sooner or later he would 
have to relinquish them the troops retired from vílna for various complicated reasons of state 
political and strategic each step of the retreat was accompanied by a complicated interplay of 
interests arguments and passions at headquarters for the pávlograd hussars however the whole of this 
retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple 
and agreeable business it was only at headquarters that there was depression uneasiness and intriguing 
in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they were going 
or why if they regretted having to retreat it was only because they had to 
leave billets they had grown accustomed to or some pretty young polish lady if the 
thought that things looked bad chanced to enter head he tried to be as cheerful 
as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs 
but only of the task nearest to hand first they camped gaily before vílna making 
acquaintance with the polish landowners preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the emperor and 
other high commanders then came an order to retreat to sventsyáni and destroy any provisions 
they could not carry away with them sventsyáni was remembered by the hussars only as 
the drunken camp a name the whole army gave to their encampment there and because 
many complaints were made against the troops who taking advantage of the order to collect 
provisions took also horses carriages and carpets from the polish proprietors rostóv remembered sventsyáni because 
on the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant 
major and was unable to manage all the drunken men of his squadron who unknown 
to him had appropriated five barrels of old beer from sventsyáni they retired farther and 
farther to drissa and thence again beyond drissa drawing near to the frontier of russia 
proper on the thirteenth of july the pávlograds took part in a serious action for 
the first time on the twelfth of july on the eve of that action there 
was a heavy storm of rain and hail in general the summer of 1812 was 
remarkable for its storms the two pávlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye 
which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses 
the rain was descending in torrents and rostóv with a young officer named ilyín his 
protégé was sitting in a hastily constructed shelter an officer of their regiment with long 
mustaches extending onto his cheeks who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by 
the rain entered shelter have come from the staff count have you heard of exploit 
and the officer gave them details of the saltánov battle which he had heard at 
the staff rostóv smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water trickled 
down his neck listened inattentively with an occasional glance at ilyín who was pressing close 
to him this officer a lad of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment was 
now in the same relation to nicholas that nicholas had been to denísov seven years 
before ilyín tried to imitate rostóv in everything and adored him as a girl might 
have done zdrzhinski the officer with the long mustache spoke grandiloquently of the saltánov dam 
being russian thermopylae and of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by 
general raévski he recounted how raévski had led his two sons onto the dam under 
terrific fire and had charged with them beside him rostóv heard the story and not 
only said nothing to encourage enthusiasm but on the contrary looked like a man ashamed 
of what he was hearing though with no intention of contradicting it since the campaigns 
of austerlitz and of 1807 rostóv knew by experience that men always lie when describing 
military exploits as he himself had done when recounting them besides that he had experience 
enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or 
relate it and so he did not like tale nor did he like zdrzhinski himself 
who with his mustaches extending over his cheeks bent low over the face of his 
hearer as was his habit and crowded rostóv in the narrow shanty rostóv looked at 
him in silence the first place there must have been such a confusion and crowding 
on the dam that was being attacked that if raévski did lead his sons there 
it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him 
thought he rest could not have seen how or with whom raévski came onto the 
dam and even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by 
it for what had they to do with tender paternal feelings when their own skins 
were in danger and besides the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether 
they took the saltánov dam or not as we are told was the case at 
thermopylae so why should he have made such a sacrifice and why expose his own 
children in the battle i would not have taken my brother pétya there or even 
ilyín a stranger to me but a nice lad but would have tried to put 
them somewhere under cover nicholas continued to think as he listened to zdrzhinski but he 
did not express his thoughts for in such matters too he had gained experience he 
knew that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had 
to pretend not to doubt it and he acted accordingly stand this any more said 
ilyín noticing that rostóv did not relish conversation stockings and shirt and the water is 
running on my seat go and look for shelter the rain seems less heavy ilyín 
went out and zdrzhinski rode away five minutes later ilyín splashing through the mud came 
running back to the shanty rostóv come quick found it about two hundred yards away 
a tavern where ours have already gathered we can at least get dry there and 
mary there mary hendríkhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor a pretty young german 
woman he had married in poland the doctor whether from lack of means or because 
he did not like to part from his young wife in the early days of 
their marriage took her about with him wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy 
had become a standing joke among the hussar officers rostóv threw his cloak over his 
shoulders shouted to lavrúshka to follow with the things slipping in the mud now splashing 
right through off with ilyín in the lessening rain and the darkness that was occasionally 
rent by distant lightning where are you what lightning they called to one another chapter 
xiii in the tavern before which stood the covered cart there were already some five 
officers mary hendríkhovna a plump little blonde german in a dressing jacket and nightcap was 
sitting on a broad bench in the front corner her husband the doctor lay asleep 
behind her rostóv and ilyín on entering the room were welcomed with merry shouts and 
laughter me how jolly we are said rostóv laughing why do you stand there gaping 
swells they are why the water streams from them make our drawing room so wet 
mess mary dress cried other voices rostóv and ilyín hastened to find a corner where 
they could change into dry clothes without offending mary modesty they were going into a 
tiny recess behind a partition to change but found it completely filled by three officers 
who sat playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box 
and these officers would on no account yield their position mary hendríkhovna obliged them with 
the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain and behind that screen 
rostóv and ilyín helped by lavrúshka who had brought their kits changed their wet things 
for dry ones a fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove a board 
was found fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth a small samovar was 
produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum and having asked mary hendríkhovna 
to preside they all crowded round her one offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe 
her charming hands another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from 
the damp another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft and 
yet another waved the flies off her face lest he should wake up him alone 
said mary hendríkhovna smiling timidly and happily is sleeping well as it is after a 
sleepless night no mary hendríkhovna replied the officer must look after the doctor perhaps take 
pity on me someday when it comes to cutting off a leg or an arm 
for me there were only three tumblers the water was so muddy that one could 
not make out whether the tea was strong or weak and the samovar held only 
six tumblers of water but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in 
order of seniority to receive tumbler from mary plump little hands with their short and 
not overclean nails all the officers appeared to be and really were in love with 
her that evening even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and 
came over to the samovar yielding to the general mood of courting mary hendríkhovna she 
seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men beamed with satisfaction try as 
she might to hide it and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband 
moved in his sleep behind her there was only one spoon sugar was more plentiful 
than anything else but it took too long to dissolve so it was decided that 
mary hendríkhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn rostóv received his tumbler and 
adding some rum to it asked mary hendríkhovna to stir it you take it without 
sugar she said smiling all the time as if everything she said and everything the 
others said was very amusing and had a double meaning is not the sugar i 
want but only that your little hand should stir my tea mary hendríkhovna assented and 
began looking for the spoon which someone meanwhile had pounced on your finger mary hendríkhovna 
it will be still nicer said rostóv hot she replied blushing with pleasure ilyín put 
a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to mary 
hendríkhovna asking her to stir it with her finger is my cup said he dip 
your finger in it and drink it all up when they had emptied the samovar 
rostóv took a pack of cards and proposed that they should play with mary hendríkhovna 
they drew lots to settle who should make up her set at suggestion it was 
agreed that whoever became should have the right to kiss mary hand and that the 
should go to refill and reheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke 
but supposing mary hendríkhovna is asked ilyín it is she is queen and her word 
is law they had hardly begun to play before the disheveled head suddenly appeared from 
behind mary hendríkhovna he had been awake for some time listening to what was being 
said and evidently found nothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on his face 
was sad and depressed without greeting the officers he scratched himself and asked to be 
allowed to pass as they were blocking the way as soon as he had left 
the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and mary hendríkhovna blushed till her 
eyes filled with tears and thereby became still more attractive to them returning from the 
yard the doctor told his wife who had ceased to smile so happily and looked 
at him in alarm awaiting her sentence that the rain had ceased and they must 
go to sleep in their covered cart or everything in it would be stolen send 
an orderly two of them said rostóv an idea doctor stand guard on it myself 
said ilyín gentlemen you have had your sleep but i have not slept for two 
nights replied the doctor and he sat down morosely beside his wife waiting for the 
game to end seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife the officers 
grew still merrier and some of them could not refrain from laughter for which they 
hurriedly sought plausible pretexts when he had gone taking his wife with him and had 
settled down with her in their covered cart the officers lay down in the tavern 
covering themselves with their wet cloaks but they did not sleep for a long time 
now they exchanged remarks recalling the uneasiness and his delight now they ran out into 
the porch and reported what was taking place in the covered trap several times rostóv 
covering his head tried to go to sleep but some remark would arouse him and 
conversation would be resumed to the accompaniment of unreasoning merry childlike laughter chapter xiv it 
was nearly three but no one was yet asleep when the quartermaster appeared with an 
order to move on to the little town of ostróvna still laughing and talking the 
officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar but 
rostóv went off to his squadron without waiting for tea day was breaking the rain 
had ceased and the clouds were dispersing it felt damp and cold especially in clothes 
that were still moist as they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn 
rostóv and ilyín both glanced under the wet and glistening leather hood of the cart 
from under the apron of which his feet were sticking out and in the middle 
of which his nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing audible really is a dear 
little thing said rostóv to ilyín who was following him charming woman said ilyín with 
all the gravity of a boy of sixteen half an hour later the squadron was 
lined up on the road the command was heard to and the soldiers crossed themselves 
and mounted rostóv riding in front gave the order and the hussars with clanking sabers 
and subdued talk their hoofs splashing in the mud defiled in fours and moved along 
the broad road planted with birch trees on each side following the infantry and a 
battery that had gone on in front tattered blue purple clouds reddening in the east 
were scudding before the wind it was growing lighter and lighter that curly grass which 
always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible still wet with the rain the drooping 
branches of the birches also wet swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops 
of water to one side the faces were more and more clearly visible rostóv always 
closely followed by ilyín rode along the side of the road between two rows of 
birch trees when campaigning rostóv allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a regimental but 
a cossack horse a judge of horses and a sportsman he had lately procured himself 
a large fine mettlesome donéts horse dun colored with light mane and tail and when 
he rode it no one could outgallop him to ride this horse was a pleasure 
to him and he thought of the horse of the morning of the wife but 
not once of the impending danger formerly when going into action rostóv had felt afraid 
now he had not the least feeling of fear he was fearless not because he 
had grown used to being under fire one cannot grow used to danger but because 
he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger he had grown accustomed 
when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to 
interest impending danger during the first period of his service hard as he tried and 
much as he reproached himself with cowardice he had not been able to do this 
but with time it had come of itself now he rode beside ilyín under the 
birch trees occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand sometimes touching his 
side with his foot or without turning round handing a pipe he had finished to 
an hussar riding behind him with as calm and careless an air as though he 
were merely out for a ride he glanced with pity at the excited face of 
ilyín who talked much and in great agitation he knew from experience the tormenting expectation 
of terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could help 
him as soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the 
clouds the wind fell as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer 
morning after the storm drops still continued to fall but vertically now and all was 
still the whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud 
that hung above it a few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the 
top of the cloud tearing its edge everything grew bright and glittered and with that 
light and as if in reply to it came the sound of guns ahead of 
them before rostóv had had time to consider and determine the distance of that firing 
count ostermann adjutant came galloping from vítebsk with orders to advance at a trot along 
the road the squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the had also quickened their 
down a hill and passing through an empty and deserted village again ascended the horses 
began to lather and the men to flush dress your ranks the order of the 
regimental commander was heard ahead by the left walk march came the order from in 
front and the hussars passing along the line of troops on the left flank of 
our position halted behind our uhlans who were in the front line to the right 
stood our infantry in a dense column they were the reserve higher up the hill 
on the very horizon our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air brightly illuminated 
by slanting morning sunbeams in front beyond a hollow dale could be seen the columns 
and guns our advanced line already in action could be heard briskly exchanging shots with 
the enemy in the dale at these sounds long unheard spirits rose as at the 
strains of the merriest music trap ta ta tap cracked the shots now together now 
several quickly one after another again all was silent and then again it sounded as 
if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them the hussars remained in the same 
place for about an hour a cannonade began count ostermann with his suite rode up 
behind the squadron halted spoke to the commander of the regiment and rode up the 
hill to the guns after ostermann had gone a command rang out to the uhlans 
column prepare to charge the infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow 
the cavalry to pass the uhlans started the streamers on their spears fluttering and trotted 
downhill toward the french cavalry which was seen below to the left as soon as 
the uhlans descended the hill the hussars were ordered up the hill to support the 
battery as they took the places vacated by the uhlans bullets came from the front 
whining and whistling but fell spent without taking effect the sounds which he had not 
heard for so long had an even more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on rostóv than 
the previous sounds of firing drawing himself up he viewed the field of battle opening 
out before him from the hill and with his whole soul followed the movement of 
the uhlans they swooped down close to the french dragoons something confused happened there amid 
the smoke and five minutes later our uhlans were galloping back not to the place 
they had occupied but more to the left and among the orange colored uhlans on 
chestnut horses and behind them in a large group blue french dragoons on gray horses 
could be seen chapter xv rostóv with his keen eye was one of the first 
to catch sight of these blue french dragoons pursuing our uhlans nearer and nearer in 
disorderly crowds came the uhlans and the french dragoons pursuing them he could already see 
how these men who looked so small at the foot of the hill jostled and 
overtook one another waving their arms and their sabers in the air rostóv gazed at 
what was happening before him as at a hunt he felt instinctively that if the 
hussars struck at the french dragoons now the latter could not withstand them but if 
a charge was to be made it must be done now at that very moment 
or it would be too late he looked around a captain standing beside him was 
gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them sevastyánych said rostóv know 
we could crush them fine thing too replied the captain really rostóv without waiting to 
hear him out touched his horse galloped to the front of his squadron and before 
he had time to finish giving the word of command the whole squadron sharing his 
feeling was following him rostóv himself did not know how or why he did it 
he acted as he did when hunting without reflecting or considering he saw the dragoons 
near and that they were galloping in disorder he knew they could not withstand an 
there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would not 
return the bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was 
so eager to go that he could not restrain himself he touched his horse gave 
the word of command and immediately hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of 
his deployed squadron rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons hardly had they reached 
the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a gallop which grew 
faster and faster as they drew nearer to our uhlans and the french dragoons who 
galloped after them the dragoons were now close at hand on seeing the hussars the 
foremost began to turn while those behind began to halt with the same feeling with 
which he had galloped across the path of a wolf rostóv gave rein to his 
donéts horse and galloped to intersect the path of the disordered lines one uhlan stopped 
another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over 
and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars nearly all the french dragoons were 
galloping back rostóv picking out one on a gray horse dashed after him on the 
way he came upon a bush his gallant horse cleared it and almost before he 
had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy 
he had selected that frenchman by his uniform an officer was going at a gallop 
crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber in another moment 
horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the horse almost knocking it over and 
at the same instant rostóv without knowing why raised his saber and struck the frenchman 
with it the instant he had done this all animation vanished the officer fell not 
so much from the had but slightly cut his arm above the from the shock 
to his horse and from fright rostóv reined in his horse and his eyes sought 
his foe to see whom he had vanquished the french dragoon officer was hopping with 
one foot on the ground the other being caught in the stirrup his eyes screwed 
up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow gazed up at rostóv 
with shrinking terror his pale and mud stained and young with a dimple in the 
chin and light blue not an face at all suited to a battlefield but a 
most ordinary homelike face before rostóv had decided what to do with him the officer 
cried surrender he hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup 
and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from face some hussars who galloped up 
disengaged his foot and helped him into the saddle on all sides the hussars were 
busy with the dragoons one was wounded but though his face was bleeding he would 
not give up his horse another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms 
round him a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse in 
front the french infantry were firing as they ran the hussars galloped hastily back with 
their prisoners rostóv galloped back with the rest aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression 
in his heart something vague and confused which he could not at all account for 
had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow he had 
dealt him count ostermann tolstóy met the returning hussars sent for rostóv thanked him and 
said he would report his gallant deed to the emperor and would recommend him for 
a st cross when sent for by count ostermann rostóv remembering that he had charged 
without orders felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach 
of discipline flattering words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all 
the more pleasantly but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea 
what on earth is worrying me he asked himself as he rode back from the 
general no safe have i disgraced myself in any way no not it something else 
resembling remorse tormented him oh yes that french officer with the dimple and i remember 
how my arm paused when i raised it rostóv saw the prisoners being led away 
and galloped after them to have a look at his frenchman with the dimple on 
his chin he was sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked 
anxiously about him the sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound 
he glanced at rostóv with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting rostóv 
still had the same indefinite feeling as of shame all that day and the next 
his friends and comrades noticed that rostóv without being dull or angry was silent thoughtful 
and preoccupied he drank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept turning something over in 
his mind rostóv was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his which to his 
amazement had gained him the st cross and even given him a reputation for bravery 
and there was something he could not at all understand others are even more afraid 
than i am he thought all there is in what is called heroism and did 
i do it for my sake and how was he to blame with his dimple 
and blue eyes and how frightened he was he thought that i should kill him 
why should i kill him my hand trembled and they have given me a st 
cross i make it out at all but while nicholas was considering these questions and 
still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so the wheel of fortune 
in the service as often happens turned in his favor after the affair at ostróvna 
he was brought into notice received command of an hussar battalion and when a brave 
officer was needed he was chosen chapter xvi on receiving news of illness the countess 
though not quite well yet and still weak went to moscow with pétya and the 
rest of the household and the whole family moved from márya house to their own 
and settled down in town illness was so serious that fortunately for her and for 
her parents the consideration of all that had caused the illness her conduct and the 
breaking off of her engagement receded into the background she was so ill that it 
was impossible for them to consider in how far she was to blame for what 
had happened she could not eat or sleep grew visibly thinner coughed and as the 
doctors made them feel was in danger they could not think of anything but how 
to help her doctors came to see her singly and in consultation talked much in 
french german and latin blamed one another and prescribed a great variety of medicines for 
all the diseases known to them but the simple idea never occurred to any of 
them that they could not know the disease natásha was suffering from as no disease 
suffered by a live man can be known for every living person has his own 
peculiarities and always has his own peculiar personal novel complicated disease unknown to a disease 
of the lungs liver skin heart nerves and so on mentioned in medical books but 
a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs 
this simple thought could not occur to the doctors as it cannot occur to a 
wizard that he is unable to work his charms because the business of their lives 
was to cure and they received money for it and had spent the best years 
of their lives on that business but above all that thought was kept out of 
their minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful as in fact 
they were to the whole rostóv family their usefulness did not depend on making the 
patient swallow substances for the most part harmful the harm was scarcely perceptible as they 
were given in small doses but they were useful necessary and indispensable because they satisfied 
a mental need of the invalid and of those who loved that is why there 
are and always will be pseudo healers wise women homeopaths and allopaths they satisfied that 
eternal human need for hope of relief for sympathy and that something should be done 
which is felt by those who are suffering they satisfied the need seen in its 
most elementary form in a child when it wants to have a place rubbed that 
has been hurt a child knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of 
its mother or nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed and it feels 
better when this is done the child cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of 
its people have no remedy for its pain and the hope of relief and the 
expression of its sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it the doctors were of 
use to natásha because they kissed and rubbed her bump assuring her that it would 
soon pass if only the coachman went to the in the arbát and got a 
powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy kopeks and 
if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of precisely two hours neither 
more nor less what would sónya and the count and countess have done how would 
they have looked if nothing had been done if there had not been those pills 
to give by the clock the warm drinks the chicken cutlets and all the other 
details of life ordered by the doctors the carrying out of which supplied an occupation 
and consolation to the family circle how would the count have borne his dearly loved 
illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand rubles and that 
he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her or had he not known that 
if her illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take her 
abroad for consultations there and had he not been able to explain the details of 
how métivier and feller had not understood the symptoms but frise had and múdrov had 
diagnosed them even better what would the countess have done had she not been able 
sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly obeying the orders never get well like 
that she would say forgetting her grief in her vexation you obey the doctor and 
take your medicine at the right time you trifle with it you know or it 
may turn to pneumonia she would go on deriving much comfort from the utterance of 
that foreign word incomprehensible to others as well as to herself what would sónya have 
done without the glad consciousness that she had not undressed during the first three nights 
in order to be ready to carry out all the injunctions with precision and that 
she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when 
the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered even to 
natásha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being made for 
her sake and to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours though 
she declared that no medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense and 
it was even pleasant to be able to show by disregarding the orders that she 
did not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life the doctor came 
every day felt her pulse looked at her tongue and regardless of her grief stricken 
face joked with her but when he had gone into another room to which the 
countess hurriedly followed him he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said 
that though there was danger he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine 
and one must wait and see that the malady was chiefly mental but and the 
countess trying to conceal the action from herself and from him slipped a gold coin 
into his hand and always returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind the 
symptoms of illness were that she ate little slept little coughed and was always low 
spirited the doctors said that she could not get on without medical treatment so they 
kept her in the stifling atmosphere of the town and the rostóvs did not move 
to the country that summer of 1812 in spite of the many pills she swallowed 
and the drops and powders out of the little bottles and boxes of which madame 
schoss who was fond of such things made a large collection and in spite of 
being deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed youth prevailed grief began 
to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life it ceased to press so painfully 
on her heart it gradually faded into the past and she began to recover physically 
chapter xvii natásha was calmer but no happier she not merely avoided all external forms 
of promenades concerts and she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter 
she could not sing as soon as she began to laugh or tried to sing 
by herself tears choked her tears of remorse tears at the recollection of those pure 
times which could never return tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined 
her young life which might have been so happy laughter and singing in particular seemed 
to her like a blasphemy in face of her sorrow without any need of self 
restraint no wish to coquet ever entered her head she said and felt at that 
time that no man was more to her than nastásya ivánovna the buffoon something stood 
sentinel within her and forbade her every joy besides she had lost all the old 
interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope the previous 
autumn the hunting and the christmas holidays spent with nicholas at otrádnoe were what she 
recalled oftenest and most painfully what would she not have given to bring back even 
a single day of that time but it was gone forever her presentiment at the 
time had not deceived that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not 
return again yet it was necessary to live on it comforted her to reflect that 
she was not better as she had formerly imagined but worse much worse than anybody 
else in the world but this was not enough she knew that and asked herself 
next but there was nothing to come there was no joy in life yet life 
was passing natásha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to anyone 
but wanted nothing for herself she kept away from everyone in the house and felt 
at ease only with her brother pétya she liked to be with him better than 
with the others and when alone with him she sometimes laughed she hardly ever left 
the house and of those who came to see them was glad to see only 
one person pierre it would have been impossible to treat her with more delicacy greater 
care and at the same time more seriously than did count bezúkhov natásha unconsciously felt 
this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society but she was not even 
grateful to him for it nothing good on part seemed to her to be an 
effort it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was 
no merit in his kindness sometimes natásha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in 
her presence especially when he wanted to do something to please her or feared that 
something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her she noticed this and attributed 
it to his general kindness and shyness which she imagined must be the same toward 
everyone as it was to her after those involuntary if he were free he would 
have asked on his knees for her hand and her at a moment when she 
was so strongly agitated pierre never spoke to natásha of his feelings and it seemed 
plain to her that those words which had then so comforted her were spoken as 
all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a crying child it was not 
because pierre was a married man but because natásha felt very strongly with him that 
moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with kurágin that it never entered 
her head that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her 
part still less on his or even to the kind of tender self conscious romantic 
friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known several instances before 
the end of the fast of st peter agraféna ivánovna belóva a country neighbor of 
the rostóvs came to moscow to pay her devotions at the shrines of the moscow 
saints she suggested that natásha should fast and prepare for holy communion and natásha gladly 
welcomed the idea despite the orders that she should not go out early in the 
morning natásha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament not as they generally prepared 
for it in the rostóv family by attending three services in their own house but 
as agraféna ivánovna did by going to church every day for a week and not 
once missing vespers matins or mass the countess was pleased with zeal after the poor 
results of the medical treatment in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer 
might help her daughter more than medicines and though not without fear and concealing it 
from the doctor she agreed to wish and entrusted her to belóva agraféna ivánovna used 
to come to wake natásha at three in the morning but generally found her already 
awake she was afraid of being late for matins hastily washing and meekly putting on 
her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla natásha shivering in the fresh air went out 
into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn by agraféna advice natásha 
prepared herself not in their own parish but at a church where according to the 
devout agraféna ivánovna the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life there 
were never many people in the church natásha always stood beside belóva in the customary 
place before an icon of the blessed virgin let into the screen before the choir 
on the left side and a feeling new to her of humility before something great 
and incomprehensible seized her when at that unusual morning hour gazing at the dark face 
of the virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light 
falling from the window she listened to the words of the service which she tried 
to follow with understanding when she understood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the 
prayers with shades of its own when she did not understand it was sweeter still 
to think that the wish to understand everything is pride that it is impossible to 
understand all that it is only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to god 
whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments she crossed herself bowed low and 
when she did not understand in horror at her own vileness simply asked god to 
forgive her everything everything to have mercy upon her the prayers to which she surrendered 
herself most of all were those of repentance on her way home at an early 
hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the 
street and everybody within the houses was still asleep natásha experienced a feeling new to 
her a sense of the possibility of correcting her faults the possibility of a new 
clean life and of happiness during the whole week she spent in this way that 
feeling grew every day and the happiness of taking communion or as agraféna ivánovna joyously 
playing with the word called it seemed to natásha so great that she felt she 
should never live till that blessed sunday but the happy day came and on that 
memorable sunday when dressed in white muslin she returned home after communion for the first 
time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the 
life that lay before her the doctor who came to see her that day ordered 
her to continue the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously must certainly go on 
taking them morning and evening said he evidently sincerely satisfied with his success please be 
particular about it quite easy he continued playfully as he adroitly took the gold coin 
in his palm will soon be singing and frolicking about the last medicine has done 
her a very great deal of good she has freshened up very much the countess 
with a cheerful expression on her face looked down at her nails and spat a 
little for luck as she returned to the drawing room chapter xviii at the beginning 
of july more and more disquieting reports about the war began to spread in moscow 
people spoke of an appeal by the emperor to the people and of his coming 
himself from the army to moscow and as up to the eleventh of july no 
manifesto or appeal had been received exaggerated reports became current about them and about the 
position of russia it was said that the emperor was leaving the army because it 
was in danger it was said that smolénsk had surrendered that napoleon had an army 
of a million and only a miracle could save russia on the eleventh of july 
which was saturday the manifesto was received but was not yet in print and pierre 
who was at the promised to come to dinner next day sunday and bring a 
copy of the manifesto and appeal which he would obtain from count rostopchín that sunday 
the rostóvs went to mass at the private chapel as usual it was a hot 
july day even at ten when the rostóvs got out of their carriage at the 
chapel the sultry air the shouts of hawkers the light and gay summer clothes of 
the crowd the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard the sounds of the 
band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade the rattling of wheels 
on the cobblestones and the brilliant hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor 
that content and discontent with the present which is most strongly felt on a bright 
hot day in town all the moscow notabilities all the acquaintances were at the chapel 
for as if expecting something to happen many wealthy families who usually left town for 
their country estates had not gone away that summer as natásha at her side passed 
through the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them she heard 
a young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper rostóva the one who 
much thinner but all the same pretty she heard or thought she heard the names 
of kurágin and bolkónski but she was always imagining that it always seemed to her 
that everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her 
with a sinking heart wretched as she always was now when she found herself in 
a crowd natásha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace women can the 
more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul she knew 
for certain that she was pretty but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it 
used to on the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late and 
particularly so on this bright hot summer day in town sunday week past she thought 
recalling that she had been here the sunday before always the same life that is 
no life and the same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to 
live pretty young and i know that now i am good i used to be 
bad but now i know i am good she thought yet my best years are 
slipping by and are no good to anyone she stood by her side and exchanged 
nods with acquaintances near her from habit she scrutinized the dresses condemned the bearing of 
a lady standing close by who was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped 
manner and again she thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was 
judging others and suddenly at the sound of the service she felt horrified at her 
own vileness horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to her 
a comely fresh looking old man was conducting the service with that mild solemnity which 
has so elevating and soothing an effect on the souls of the worshipers the gates 
of the sanctuary screen were closed the curtain was slowly drawn and from behind it 
a soft mysterious voice pronounced some words tears the cause of which she herself did 
not understand made breast heave and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her me what 
i should do how to live my life how i may grow good forever forever 
she pleaded the deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and 
holding his thumb extended drew his long hair from under his dalmatic and making the 
sign of the cross on his breast began in a loud and solemn voice to 
recite the words of the prayer peace let us pray unto the lord one community 
without distinction of class without enmity united by brotherly us pray thought natásha the peace 
that is from above and for the salvation of our souls the world of angels 
and all the spirits who dwell above us prayed natásha when they prayed for the 
warriors she thought of her brother and denísov when they prayed for all traveling by 
land and sea she remembered prince andrew prayed for him and asked god to forgive 
her all the wrongs she had done him when they prayed for those who love 
us she prayed for the members of her own family her father and mother and 
sónya realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward them and feeling 
all the strength of her love for them when they prayed for those who hate 
us she tried to think of her enemies and people who hated her in order 
to pray for them she included among her enemies the creditors and all who had 
business dealings with her father and always at the thought of enemies and those who 
hated her she remembered anatole who had done her so much though he did not 
hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy only at prayer did 
she feel able to think clearly and calmly of prince andrew and anatole as men 
for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and devotion to god 
when they prayed for the imperial family and the synod she bowed very low and 
made the sign of the cross saying to herself that even if she did not 
understand still she could not doubt and at any rate loved the governing synod and 
prayed for it when he had finished the litany the deacon crossed the stole over 
his breast and said us commit ourselves and our whole lives to christ the lord 
ourselves to god natásha inwardly repeated god i submit myself to thy will she thought 
want nothing wish for nothing teach me what to do and how to use my 
will take me take me prayed natásha with impatient emotion in her heart not crossing 
herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some invisible power at 
any moment to take her and deliver her from herself from her regrets desires remorse 
hopes and sins the countess looked round several times at her softened face and shining 
eyes and prayed god to help her unexpectedly in the middle of the service and 
not in the usual order natásha knew so well the deacon brought out a small 
stool the one he knelt on when praying on trinity sunday and placed it before 
the doors of the sanctuary screen the priest came out with his purple velvet biretta 
on his head adjusted his hair and knelt down with an effort everybody followed his 
example and they looked at one another in surprise then came the prayer just received 
from the prayer for the deliverance of russia from hostile invasion god of might god 
of our salvation began the priest in that voice clear not grandiloquent but mild in 
which only the slav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a russian heart 
god of might god of our salvation look this day in mercy and blessing on 
thy humble people and graciously hear us spare us and have mercy upon us this 
foe confounding thy land desiring to lay waste the whole world rises against us these 
lawless men are gathered together to overthrow thy kingdom to destroy thy dear jerusalem thy 
beloved russia to defile thy temples to overthrow thine altars and to desecrate our holy 
shrines how long o lord how long shall the wicked triumph how long shall they 
wield unlawful power god hear us when we pray to thee strengthen with thy might 
our most gracious sovereign lord the emperor alexander pávlovich be mindful of his uprightness and 
meekness reward him according to his righteousness and let it preserve us thy chosen israel 
bless his counsels his undertakings and his work strengthen his kingdom by thine almighty hand 
and give him victory over his enemy even as thou gavest moses the victory over 
amalek gideon over midian and david over goliath preserve his army put a bow of 
brass in the hands of those who have armed themselves in thy name and gird 
their loins with strength for the fight take up the spear and shield and arise 
to help us confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us 
may they be before the faces of thy faithful warriors as dust before the wind 
and may thy mighty angel confound them and put them to flight may they be 
ensnared when they know it not and may the plots they have laid in secret 
be turned against them let them fall before thy feet and be laid low by 
our hosts lord thou art able to save both great and small thou art god 
and man cannot prevail against thee of our fathers remember thy bounteous mercy and loving 
kindness which are from of old turn not thy face from us but be gracious 
to our unworthiness and in thy great goodness and thy many mercies regard not our 
transgressions and iniquities create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within 
us strengthen us all in thy faith fortify our hope inspire us with true love 
one for another arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the 
heritage thou gavest to us and to our fathers and let not the scepter of 
the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those thou hast sanctified lord our god 
in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust let us not be 
confounded in our hope of thy mercy and give us a token of thy blessing 
that those who hate us and our orthodox faith may see it and be put 
to shame and perish and may all the nations know that thou art the lord 
and we are thy people show thy mercy upon us this day o lord and 
grant us thy salvation make the hearts of thy servants to rejoice in thy mercy 
smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath the feet of thy faithful servants 
for thou art the defense the succor and the victory of them that put their 
trust in thee and to thee be all glory to father son and holy ghost 
now and forever world without end amen in receptive condition of soul this prayer affected 
her strongly she listened to every word about the victory of moses over amalek of 
gideon over midian and of david over goliath and about the destruction of jerusalem and 
she prayed to god with the tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing 
but without fully understanding what she was asking of god in that prayer she shared 
with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness for the strengthening 
of the heart by faith and hope and its animation by love but she could 
not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes 
before she had been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for 
them but neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read 
on bended knees she felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the 
thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins and especially of her own 
sins and she prayed to god to forgive them all and her too and to 
give them all and her too peace and happiness and it seemed to her that 
god heard her prayer chapter xix from the day when pierre after leaving the with 
grateful look fresh in his mind had gazed at the comet that seemed to be 
fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own that 
day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things that had incessantly 
tormented him no longer presented itself that terrible question which had come to him amid 
every occupation was now replaced not by another question or by a reply to the 
former question but by her image when he listened to or himself took part in 
trivial conversations when he read or heard of human baseness or folly he was not 
horrified as formerly and did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things 
when all is so transient and he remembered her as he had last seen her 
and all his doubts because she had answered the questions that had haunted him but 
because his conception of her transferred him instantly to another a brighter realm of spiritual 
activity in which no one could be justified or realm of beauty and love which 
it was worth living for whatever worldly baseness presented itself to him he said to 
himself supposing n n has swindled the country and the tsar and the country and 
the tsar confer honors upon him what does that matter she smiled at me yesterday 
and asked me to come again and i love her and no one will ever 
know it and his soul felt calm and peaceful pierre still went into society drank 
as much and led the same idle and dissipated life because besides the hours he 
spent at the there were other hours he had to spend somehow and the habits 
and acquaintances he had made in moscow formed a current that bore him along irresistibly 
but latterly when more and more disquieting reports came from the seat of war and 
health began to improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling of 
careful pity an ever increasing restlessness which he could not explain took possession of him 
he felt that the condition he was in could not continue long that a catastrophe 
was coming which would change his whole life and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs 
of that approaching catastrophe one of his brother masons had revealed to pierre the following 
prophecy concerning napoleon drawn from the revelation of st john in chapter 13 verse 18 
of the apocalypse it is said here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count 
the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his 
number is six hundred threescore and six and in the fifth verse of the same 
chapter and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and 
power was given unto him to continue forty and two months the french alphabet written 
out with the same numerical values as the hebrew in which the first nine letters 
denote units and the others tens will have the following significance a b c d 
e f g h i k 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
10 l m n o p q r s 20 30 40 50 60 70 
80 90 t u v w x y 100 110 120 130 140 150 z 
160 writing the words napoléon in numbers it appears that the sum of them is 
666 and that napoleon was therefore the beast foretold in the apocalypse moreover by applying 
the same system to the words quarante deux which was the term allowed to the 
beast that great things and blasphemies the same number 666 was obtained from which it 
followed that the limit fixed for power had come in the year 1812 when the 
french emperor was forty two this prophecy pleased pierre very much and he often asked 
himself what would put an end to the power of the beast that is of 
napoleon and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding them 
up to find an answer to the question that engrossed him he wrote the words 
alexandre la nation russe and added up their numbers but the sums were either more 
or less than 666 once when making such calculations he wrote down his own name 
in french comte pierre besouhoff but the sum of the numbers did not come right 
then he changed the spelling substituting a z for the s and adding de and 
the article le still without obtaining the desired result then it occurred to him if 
the answer to the question were contained in his name his nationality would also be 
given in the answer so he wrote le russe besuhof and adding up the numbers 
got 671 this was only five too much and five was represented by e the 
very letter elided from the article le before the word empereur by omitting the e 
though incorrectly pierre got the answer he sought besuhof made 666 this discovery excited him 
how or by what means he was connected with the great event foretold in the 
apocalypse he did not know but he did not doubt that connection for a moment 
his love for natásha antichrist napoleon the invasion the comet 666 napoléon and this had 
to mature and culminate to lift him out of that spellbound petty sphere of moscow 
habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great achievement 
and great happiness forty two on the eve of the sunday when the special prayer 
was read pierre had promised the rostóvs to bring them from count rostopchín whom he 
knew well both the appeal to the people and the news from the army in 
the morning when he went to call at he met there a courier fresh from 
the army an acquaintance of his own who often danced at moscow balls please for 
sake relieve me of something said the courier have a sackful of letters to parents 
among these letters was one from nicholas rostóv to his father pierre took that letter 
and rostopchín also gave him the appeal to moscow which had just been printed the 
last army orders and his own most recent bulletin glancing through the army orders pierre 
found in one of them in the lists of killed wounded and rewarded the name 
of nicholas rostóv awarded a st cross of the fourth class for courage shown in 
the ostróvna affair and in the same order the name of prince andrew bolkónski appointed 
to the command of a regiment of chasseurs though he did not want to remind 
the rostóvs of bolkónski pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news 
of their having received a decoration so he sent that printed army order and letter 
to the rostóvs keeping the appeal the bulletin and the other orders to take with 
him when he went to dinner his conversation with count rostopchín and the tone of 
anxious hurry the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly things were 
going in the army the rumors of the discovery of spies in moscow and of 
a leaflet in circulation stating that napoleon promised to be in both the russian capitals 
by the autumn and the talk of the being expected to arrive next aroused with 
fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation in pierre which he had been conscious 
of ever since the appearance of the comet and especially since the beginning of the 
war he had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so 
had he not been hindered first by his membership of the society of freemasons to 
which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual peace and the abolition of 
war and secondly by the fact that when he saw the great mass of muscovites 
who had donned uniform and were talking patriotism he somehow felt ashamed to take the 
step but the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army 
lay in the vague idea that he was besuhof who had the number of the 
beast 666 that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the 
power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity 
and that therefore he ought not to undertake anything but wait for what was bound 
to come to pass chapter xx a few intimate friends were dining with the rostóvs 
that day as usual on sundays pierre came early so as to find them alone 
he had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he 
not been so tall so broad of limb and so strong that he carried his 
bulk with evident ease he went up the stairs puffing and muttering something his coachman 
did not even ask whether he was to wait he knew that when his master 
was at the he stayed till midnight the footman rushed eagerly forward to help him 
off with his cloak and take his hat and stick pierre from club habit always 
left both hat and stick in the anteroom the first person he saw in the 
house was natásha even before he saw her while taking off his cloak he heard 
her she was practicing solfa exercises in the music room he knew that she had 
not sung since her illness and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted 
him he opened the door softly and saw her in the lilac dress she had 
worn at church walking about the room singing she had her back to him when 
he opened the door but when turning quickly she saw his broad surprised face she 
blushed and came rapidly up to him want to try to sing again she said 
adding as if by way of excuse is at least something to do capital glad 
i am come i am so happy today she said with the old animation pierre 
had not seen in her for a long time know nicholas has received a st 
cross i am so proud of him yes i sent that announcement but i want 
to interrupt you he added and was about to go to the drawing room natásha 
stopped him is it wrong of me to sing she said blushing and fixing her 
eyes inquiringly on him why should it be on the contrary but why do you 
ask me know myself natásha answered quickly i should not like to do anything you 
disapproved of i believe in you completely you know how important you are to me 
how much done for me she spoke rapidly and did not notice how pierre flushed 
at her words saw in that same army order that he she whispered the name 
hastily in russia and in the army again what do you think was speaking hurriedly 
evidently afraid her strength might fail he ever forgive me will he not always have 
a bitter feeling toward me what do you think what do you think think pierre 
replied he has nothing to forgive if i were in his place by association of 
ideas pierre was at once carried back to the day when trying to comfort her 
he had said that if he were not himself but the best man in the 
world and free he would ask on his knees for her hand and the same 
feeling of pity tenderness and love took possession of him and the same words rose 
to his lips but she did not give him time to say them you you 
she said uttering the word you a different thing i know no one kinder more 
generous or better than you nobody could be had you not been there then and 
now too i know what would have become of me because tears suddenly rose in 
her eyes she turned away lifted her music before her eyes began singing again and 
again began walking up and down the room just then pétya came running in from 
the drawing room pétya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red 
lips and resembled natásha he was preparing to enter the university but he and his 
friend obolénski had lately in secret agreed to join the hussars pétya had come rushing 
out to talk to his namesake about this affair he had asked pierre to find 
out whether he would be accepted in the hussars pierre walked up and down the 
drawing room not listening to what pétya was saying pétya pulled him by the arm 
to attract his attention what about my plan peter kirílych for sake you are my 
only hope said pétya yes your plan to join the hussars mention it bring it 
all up today mon cher have you got the manifesto asked the old count countess 
has been to mass at the and heard the new prayer she says very fine 
got it said pierre emperor is to be here tomorrow to be an extraordinary meeting 
of the nobility and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand 
oh yes let me congratulate you yes thank god well and what news from the 
army are again retreating they say already near smolénsk replied pierre lord o lord exclaimed 
the count is the manifesto appeal oh yes pierre began feeling in his pockets for 
the papers but could not find them still slapping his pockets he kissed the hand 
of the countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around evidently expecting natásha who 
had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room my word 
i know what done with it he said he is always losing everything remarked the 
countess natásha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat down looking 
silently at pierre as soon as she entered features which had been gloomy suddenly lighted 
up and while still searching for the papers he glanced at her several times really 
drive home i must have left them there certainly be late for dinner and my 
coachman has gone but sónya who had gone to look for the papers in the 
anteroom had found them in hat where he had carefully tucked them under the lining 
pierre was about to begin reading after dinner said the old count evidently expecting much 
enjoyment from that reading at dinner at which champagne was drunk to the health of 
the new chevalier of st george shinshín told them the town news of the illness 
of the old georgian princess of disappearance from moscow and of how some german fellow 
had been brought to rostopchín and accused of being a french so count rostopchín had 
told the story and how rostopchín let him go and assured the people that he 
was a spire at all but only an old german ruin are being arrested said 
the count told the countess she should not speak french so much not the time 
for it now have you heard shinshín asked golítsyn has engaged a master to teach 
him russian it is becoming dangerous to speak french in the streets how about you 
count peter kirílych if they call up the militia you too will have to mount 
a horse remarked the old count addressing pierre pierre had been silent and preoccupied all 
through dinner seeming not to grasp what was said he looked at the count yes 
the war he said what sort of warrior should i make and yet everything is 
so strange so strange i make it out i know i am very far from 
having military tastes but in these times no one can answer for himself after dinner 
the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and with a serious face asked 
sónya who was considered an excellent reader to read the appeal moscow our ancient capital 
enemy has entered the borders of russia with immense forces he comes to despoil our 
beloved country sónya read painstakingly in her high pitched voice the count listened with closed 
eyes heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages natásha sat erect gazing with a searching look 
now at her father and now at pierre pierre felt her eyes on him and 
tried not to look round the countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every 
solemn expression in the manifesto in all these words she saw only that the danger 
threatening her son would not soon be over shinshín with a sarcastic smile on his 
lips was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that gave him the opportunity reading 
any remark of the or even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself 
after reading about the dangers that threatened russia the hopes the emperor placed on moscow 
and especially on its illustrious nobility sónya with a quiver in her voice due chiefly 
to the attention that was being paid to her read the last words ourselves will 
not delay to appear among our people in that capital and in other parts of 
our realm for consultation and for the direction of all our levies both those now 
barring the path and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear may 
the ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head and may 
europe delivered from bondage glorify the name of russia it cried the count opening his 
moist eyes and sniffing repeatedly as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his 
nose and he added the emperor but say the word and sacrifice everything and begrudge 
nothing before shinshín had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on 
the patriotism natásha jumped up from her place and ran to her father a darling 
our papa is she cried kissing him and she again looked at pierre with the 
unconscious coquetry that had returned to her with her better spirits a patriot for you 
said shinshín a patriot at all but simply natásha replied in an injured tone seems 
funny to you but this at all a joke joke indeed put in the count 
him but say the word and all go not germans did you notice it says 
said pierre mind what for at this moment pétya to whom nobody was paying any 
attention came up to his father with a very flushed face and said in his 
breaking voice that was now deep and now shrill papa i tell you definitely and 
mamma too as you please but i say definitely that you must let me enter 
the army because i all the countess in dismay looked up to heaven clasped her 
hands and turned angrily to her husband comes of your talking said she but the 
count had already recovered from his excitement come said he a fine warrior no nonsense 
you must study not nonsense papa fédya obolénski is younger than i and going too 
besides all the same i study now when pétya stopped short flushed till he perspired 
but still got out the words our fatherland is in danger do you said yourself 
that we would sacrifice everything be quiet i tell you cried the count with a 
glance at his wife who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son 
i tell kirílych here will also tell you i tell you your milk has hardly 
dried on your lips and you want to go into the army there there i 
tell you and the count moved to go out of the room taking the papers 
probably to reread them in his study before having a nap peter kirílych go and 
have a smoke he said pierre was agitated and undecided unwontedly brilliant eyes continually glancing 
at him with a more than cordial look had reduced him to this condition i 
think go home why you meant to spend the evening with us you often come 
nowadays as it is and this girl of mine said the count good naturedly pointing 
to natásha brightens up when here i had forgotten i really must go home business 
said pierre hurriedly then au revoir said the count and went out of the room 
are you going why are you upset asked natásha and she looked challengingly into eyes 
i love you was what he wanted to say but he did not say it 
and only blushed till the tears came and lowered his eyes it is better for 
me to come less often because no simply i have business no tell me natásha 
began resolutely and suddenly stopped they looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces 
he tried to smile but could not his smile expressed suffering and he silently kissed 
her hand and went out pierre made up his mind not to go to the 
any more chapter xxi after the definite refusal he had received pétya went to his 
room and there locked himself in and wept bitterly when he came in to tea 
silent morose and with tear stained face everybody pretended not to notice anything next day 
the emperor arrived in moscow and several of the domestic serfs begged permission to go 
to have a look at him that morning pétya was a long time dressing and 
arranging his hair and collar to look like a grown up man he frowned before 
his looking glass gesticulated shrugged his shoulders and finally without saying a word to anyone 
took his cap and left the house by the back door trying to avoid notice 
pétya decided to go straight to where the emperor was and to explain frankly to 
some gentleman in waiting he imagined the emperor to be always surrounded by gentlemen in 
waiting that he count rostóv in spite of his youth wished to serve his country 
that youth could be no hindrance to loyalty and that he was ready to while 
dressing pétya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentleman in 
waiting it was on the very fact of being so young that pétya counted for 
success in reaching the even thought how surprised everyone would be at his yet in 
the arrangement of his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished 
to appear a grown up man but the farther he went and the more his 
attention was diverted by the ever increasing crowds moving toward the krémlin the less he 
remembered to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man as he approached the 
krémlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in 
a menacing way but within the trinity gateway he was so pressed to the wall 
by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic intentions with which he had come 
that in spite of all his determination he had to give in and stop while 
carriages passed in rumbling beneath the archway beside pétya stood a peasant woman a footman 
two tradesmen and a discharged soldier after standing some time in the gateway pétya tried 
to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the carriages to 
pass and he began resolutely working his way with his elbows but the woman just 
in front of him who was the first against whom he directed his efforts angrily 
shouted at him are you shoving for young lordling you see all standing still then 
why push can shove said the footman and also began working his elbows to such 
effect that he pushed pétya into a very filthy corner of the gateway pétya wiped 
his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp collar which he had 
arranged so well at home to seem like a he felt that he no longer 
looked presentable and feared that if he were now to approach the gentlemen in waiting 
in that plight he would not be admitted to the emperor but it was impossible 
to smarten oneself up or move to another place because of the crowd one of 
the generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the and pétya thought of asking 
his help but came to the conclusion that that would not be a manly thing 
to do when the carriages had all passed in the crowd carrying pétya with it 
streamed forward into the krémlin square which was already full of people there were people 
not only in the square but the slopes and on the roofs as soon as 
pétya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the 
joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole krémlin for a while the crowd 
was less dense but suddenly all heads were bared and everyone rushed forward in one 
direction pétya was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted hurrah 
hurrah pétya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched but could see nothing except the 
people about him all the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm a 
wife standing beside pétya sobbed and the tears ran down her cheeks angel dear one 
she kept repeating wiping away her tears with her fingers was heard on all sides 
for a moment the crowd stood still but then it made another rush forward quite 
beside himself pétya clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes ferociously pushed forward elbowing his 
way and shouting as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone 
else but on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward 
and everybody shouted this is what the emperor is thought pétya i petition him would 
be too bold but in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward and 
from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space 
with a strip of red cloth spread out on it but just then the crowd 
swayed police in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the 
procession the emperor was passing from the palace to the cathedral of the pétya unexpectedly 
received such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that 
suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness when he came to 
himself a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back 
of his head and wearing a shabby blue a church clerk and holding him under 
the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the 
other crushed the young gentleman said the clerk are you up to gently crushed him 
crushed him the emperor entered the cathedral of the assumption the crowd spread out again 
more evenly and the clerk led and the tsar cannon several people were sorry for 
pétya and suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him those who stood 
nearest him attended to him unbuttoned his coat seated him on the raised platform of 
the cannon and reproached those others whoever they might be who had crushed him might 
easily get killed that way what do they mean by it killing people poor dear 
as white as a sheet voices were heard saying pétya soon came to himself the 
color returned to his face the pain had passed and at the cost of that 
temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to 
see the emperor who would be returning that way pétya no longer thought of presenting 
his petition if he could only see the emperor he would be happy while the 
service was proceeding in the cathedral of the was a combined service of prayer on 
the occasion of the arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the 
crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared selling kvass gingerbread and poppyseed sweets of which 
pétya was particularly fond and ordinary conversation could again be heard a wife was showing 
a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost another was 
saying that all silk goods had now got dear the clerk who had rescued pétya 
was talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the 
bishop the clerk several times used the word of the service a word pétya did 
not understand two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts 
all these conversations especially the joking with the girls were such as might have had 
a particular charm for pétya at his age but they did not interest him now 
he sat on his pedestal of the agitated as before by the thought of the 
emperor and by his love for him the feeling of pain and fear he had 
experienced when he was being crushed together with that of rapture still further intensified his 
sense of the importance of the occasion suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon 
was heard from the embankment to celebrate the signing of peace with the turks and 
the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing pétya too would have 
run there but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under his protection stopped 
him the firing was still proceeding when officers generals and gentlemen in waiting came running 
out of the cathedral and after them others in a more leisurely manner caps were 
again raised and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again 
at last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors hurrah shouted 
the crowd again is he which asked pétya in a tearful voice of those around 
him but no one answered him everybody was too excited and pétya fixing on one 
of those four men whom he could not clearly see for the tears of joy 
that filled his eyes concentrated all his enthusiasm on it happened not to be the 
shouted and resolved that tomorrow come what might he would join the army the crowd 
ran after the emperor followed him to the palace and began to disperse it was 
already late and pétya had not eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration yet he 
did not go home but stood with that diminishing but still considerable crowd before the 
palace while the emperor in at the palace windows expecting he knew not what and 
envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the emperor 
and the court footmen who served at table glimpses of whom could be seen through 
the windows while the emperor was dining valúev looking out of the window said people 
are still hoping to see your majesty again the dinner was nearly over and the 
emperor munching a biscuit rose and went out onto the balcony the people with pétya 
among them rushed toward the balcony dear one hurrah father cried the crowd and pétya 
with it and again the women and men of weaker mold pétya among them wept 
with joy a largish piece of the biscuit the emperor was holding in his hand 
broke off fell on the balcony parapet and then to the ground a coachman in 
a jerkin who stood nearest sprang forward and snatched it up several people in the 
crowd rushed at the coachman seeing this the emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought 
him and began throwing them down from the balcony eyes grew bloodshot and still more 
excited by the danger of being crushed he rushed at the biscuits he did not 
know why but he had to have a biscuit from the hand and he felt 
that he must not give way he sprang forward and upset an old woman who 
was catching at a biscuit the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she 
was lying on the grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach them 
pétya pushed her hand away with his knee seized a biscuit and as if fearing 
to be too late again shouted with a voice already hoarse the emperor went in 
and after that the greater part of the crowd began to disperse i said if 
only we so it was was being joyfully said by various people happy as pétya 
was he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all the enjoyment of 
that day was over he did not go straight home from the krémlin but called 
on his friend obolénski who was fifteen and was also entering the regiment on returning 
home pétya announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the 
service he would run away and next day count ilyá he had not yet quite 
to inquire how he could arrange for pétya to serve where there would be least 
danger chapter xxii two days later on the fifteenth of july an immense number of 
carriages were standing outside the slobóda palace the great halls were full in the first 
were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms in the second bearded merchants in full 
skirted coats of blue cloth and wearing medals in the hall there was an incessant 
movement and buzz of voices the chief magnates sat on high backed chairs at a 
large table under the portrait of the emperor but most of the gentry were strolling 
about the room all these nobles whom pierre met every day at the club or 
in their own houses were in in that of day others in that of emperor 
paul others again in the new uniforms of time or the ordinary uniform of the 
nobility and the general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to 
these diverse and familiar personalities both old and young the old men dim eyed toothless 
bald sallow and bloated or gaunt and wrinkled were especially striking for the most part 
they sat quietly in their places and were silent or if they walked about and 
talked attached themselves to someone younger on all these faces as on the faces of 
the crowd pétya had seen in the square there was a striking contradiction the general 
expectation of a solemn event and at the same time the everyday interests in a 
boston card party peter the cook zinaída health and so on pierre was there too 
buttoned up since early morning in a uniform that had become too tight for him 
he was agitated this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant 
états généraux states general in him a whole series of ideas he had long laid 
aside but which were deeply graven in his soul thoughts of the contrat social and 
the french revolution the words that had struck him in the the sovereign was coming 
to the capital for consultation with his this idea and imagining that in this direction 
something important which he had long awaited was drawing near he strolled about watching and 
listening to conversations but nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him the 
manifesto was read evoking enthusiasm and then all moved about discussing it besides the ordinary 
topics of conversation pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to 
stand when the emperor entered when a ball should be given in the honor whether 
they should group themselves by districts or by whole provinces and so on but as 
soon as the war was touched on or what the nobility had been convened for 
the talk became undecided and indefinite then all preferred listening to speaking a middle aged 
man handsome and virile in the uniform of a retired naval officer was speaking in 
one of the rooms and a small crowd was pressing round him pierre went up 
to the circle that had formed round the speaker and listened count ilyá rostóv in 
a military uniform of time was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd with 
all of whom he was acquainted he too approached that group and listened with a 
kindly smile and nods of approval as he always did to what the speaker was 
saying the retired naval man was speaking very boldly as was evident from the expression 
on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some people pierre knew 
as the meekest and quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him 
pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group listened and convinced himself that 
the man was indeed a liberal but of views quite different from his own the 
naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous musical and aristocratic baritone voice pleasantly swallowing his 
and generally slurring his consonants the voice of a man calling out to his servant 
bwing me my pipe it was indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority if 
the smolénsk people have offahd to waise militia for the empewah ah we to take 
smolénsk as our if the noble awistocwacy of the pwovince of moscow thinks fit it 
can show its loyalty to our the empewah in other ways have we the waising 
of the militia in the yeah all that did was to enwich the sons and 
thieves and wobbahs count ilyá rostóv smiled blandly and nodded approval was our militia of 
any use to the empia not at all it only wuined our farming bettah have 
another conscwiption men will neithah soldiers peasants and get only depwavity fwom them the nobility 
gwudge theah one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits and the that 
was the way he referred to the emperor only say the word and all die 
him added the orator with animation count mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged pierre 
but pierre wanted to speak himself he pushed forward feeling stirred but not yet sure 
what stirred him or what he would say scarcely had he opened his mouth when 
one of the senators a man without a tooth in his head with a shrewd 
though angry expression standing near the first speaker interrupted him evidently accustomed to managing debates 
and to maintaining an argument he began in low but distinct tones imagine sir said 
he mumbling with his toothless mouth we have been summoned here not to discuss whether 
best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out 
the militia we have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign 
the emperor has honored us but to judge what is or the can leave to 
the supreme authority pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement he hardened his heart 
against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into the deliberations of 
the nobility pierre stepped forward and interrupted him he himself did not yet know what 
he would say but he began to speak eagerly occasionally lapsing into french or expressing 
himself in bookish russian me your excellency he began he was well acquainted with the 
senator but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him formally i agree with 
the gentleman he hesitated he wished to say très honorable very honorable the gentleman whom 
i have not the honor of knowing i suppose that the nobility have been summoned 
not merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by 
which we can assist our fatherland i imagine he went on warming to his subject 
the emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs 
whom we are willing to devote to his service and chair à canon we are 
ready to make of not to obtain from us any co co counsel for cannon 
many persons withdrew from the circle noticing the sarcastic smile and the freedom of remarks 
only count rostóv was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of 
the naval officer the senator and in general with whatever speech he had last heard 
think that before discussing these questions pierre continued should ask the respectfully ask his let 
us know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and 
our forces now are and then but scarcely had pierre uttered these words before he 
was attacked from three sides the most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance a 
boston player who had always been well disposed toward him stepán stepánovich adráksin adráksin was 
in uniform and whether as a result of the uniform or from some other cause 
pierre saw before him quite a different man with a sudden expression of malevolence on 
his aged face adráksin shouted at pierre the first place i tell you we have 
no right to question the emperor about that and secondly if the russian nobility had 
that right the emperor could not answer such a question the troops are moved according 
to the movements and the number of men increases and decreases another voice that of 
a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age whom pierre had formerly 
met at the and knew as a bad cardplayer and who also transformed by his 
uniform came up to pierre interrupted adráksin and this is not a time for discussing 
he continued for acting there is war in russia the enemy is advancing to destroy 
russia to desecrate the tombs of our fathers to carry off our wives and children 
the nobleman smote his breast will all arise everyone of us will go for our 
father the tsar he shouted rolling his bloodshot eyes several approving voices were heard in 
the crowd are russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith 
the throne and the fatherland we must cease raving if we are sons of our 
fatherland we will show europe how russia rises to the defense of russia pierre wished 
to reply but could not get in a word he felt that his words apart 
from what meaning they conveyed were less audible than the sound of his voice count 
rostóv at the back of the crowd was expressing approval several persons briskly turning a 
shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase said right quite right just 
so pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money his serfs 
or himself only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be 
able to improve it but he was unable to speak many voices shouted and talked 
at the same time so that count rostóv had not time to signify his approval 
of them all and the group increased dispersed re formed and then moved with a 
hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table not only was 
attempt to speak unsuccessful but he was rudely interrupted pushed aside and people turned away 
from him as from a common enemy this happened not because they were displeased by 
the substance of his speech which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches 
but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible 
object to hate pierre became the latter many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman 
and all in the same tone many spoke eloquently and with originality glínka the editor 
of the russian messenger who was recognized cries of author were heard in the crowd 
said that must be repulsed by hell and that he had seen a child smiling 
at lightning flashes and thunderclaps but will not be that child yes at thunderclaps was 
repeated approvingly in the back rows of the crowd the crowd drew up to the 
large table at which sat gray haired or bald seventy year old magnates uniformed and 
besashed almost all of whom pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons 
or playing boston at the clubs with an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced 
to the table pressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs the 
orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together those standing behind noticed what a 
speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it others in that heat and crush 
racked their brains to find some thought and hastened to utter it the old magnates 
whom pierre knew sat and turned to look first at one and then at another 
and their faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it 
very hot pierre however felt excited and the general desire to show that they were 
ready to go to all found expression in the tones and looks more than in 
the substance of the him too he did not renounce his opinions but felt himself 
in some way to blame and wished to justify himself only said that it would 
be more to the purpose to make sacrifices when we know what is needed said 
he trying to be heard above the other voices one of the old men nearest 
to him looked round but his attention was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the 
other side of the table moscow will be surrendered she will be our expiation shouted 
one man is the enemy of mankind cried another me to speak you are crushing 
me chapter xxiii at that moment count rostopchín with his protruding chin and alert eyes 
wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder entered the room stepping 
briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry sovereign the emperor will be here 
in a moment said rostopchín am straight from the palace seeing the position we are 
in i think there is little need for discussion the emperor has deigned to summon 
us and the merchants millions will pour forth from pointed to the our business is 
to supply men and not spare ourselves that is the least we can do a 
conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table the whole consultation passed 
more than quietly after all the preceding noise the sound of their old voices saying 
one after another agree or for variety too am of that opinion and so on 
had even a mournful effect the secretary was told to write down the resolution of 
the moscow nobility and gentry that they would furnish ten men fully equipped out of 
every thousand serfs as the smolénsk gentry had done their chairs made a scraping noise 
as the gentlemen who had conferred rose with apparent relief and began walking up and 
down arm in arm to stretch their legs and converse in couples emperor the emperor 
a sudden cry resounded through the halls and the whole throng hurried to the entrance 
the emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of nobles every 
face expressed respectful awe struck curiosity pierre stood rather far off and could not hear 
all that the emperor said from what he did hear he understood that the emperor 
spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the 
moscow nobility he was answered by a voice which informed him of the resolution just 
arrived at said the emperor with a quivering voice there was a rustling among the 
crowd and it again subsided so that pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of 
the emperor saying with emotion never doubted the devotion of the russian nobles but today 
it has surpassed my expectations i thank you in the name of the fatherland gentlemen 
let us act time is most precious the emperor ceased speaking the crowd began pressing 
round him and rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides most precious a royal word 
said count rostóv with a sob he stood at the back and though he had 
heard hardly anything understood everything in his own way from the hall of the nobility 
the emperor went to that of the merchants there he remained about ten minutes pierre 
was among those who saw him come out from the hall with tears of emotion 
in his eyes as became known later he had scarcely begun to address the merchants 
before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice when pierre 
saw the emperor he was coming out accompanied by two merchants one of whom pierre 
knew a fat otkupshchík the other was the mayor a man with a thin sallow 
face and narrow beard both were weeping tears filled the thin eyes and the fat 
otkupshchík sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating lives and them your majesty one 
feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready to go 
all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything he now felt ashamed of his speech 
with its constitutional tendency and sought an opportunity of effacing it having heard that count 
mamónov was furnishing a regiment bezúkhov at once informed rostopchín that he would give a 
thousand men and their maintenance old rostóv could not tell his wife of what had 
passed without tears and at once consented to request and went himself to enter his 
name next day the emperor left moscow the assembled nobles all took off their uniforms 
and settled down again in their homes and clubs and not without some groans gave 
orders to their stewards about the enrollment feeling amazed themselves at what they had done 
book ten 1812 chapter i napoleon began the war with russia because he could not 
resist going to dresden could not help having his head turned by the homage he 
received could not help donning a polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating influence of 
a june morning and could not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of 
kurákin and then of balashëv alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally 
insulted barclay de tolly tried to command the army in the best way because he 
wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander rostóv charged the 
french because he could not restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field 
and in the same way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted 
in accord with their personal characteristics habits circumstances and aims they were moved by fear 
or vanity rejoiced or were indignant reasoned imagining that they knew what they were doing 
and did it of their own free will but they all were involuntary tools of 
history carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible to us such is the 
inevitable fate of men of action and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy 
the less are they free the actors of 1812 have long since left the stage 
their personal interests have vanished leaving no trace and nothing remains of that time but 
its historic results providence compelled all these men striving to attain personal aims to further 
the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all napoleon nor alexander 
nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting the cause of the 
destruction of the french army in 1812 is clear to us now no one will 
deny that that cause was on the one hand its advance into the heart of 
russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter campaign and on the 
other the character given to the war by the burning of russian towns and the 
hatred of the foe this aroused among the russian people but no one at the 
time foresaw what now seems so evident that this was the only way an army 
of eight hundred thousand best in the world and led by the best be destroyed 
in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength and led by inexperienced 
commanders as the russian army was not only did no one see this but on 
the russian side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save 
russia while on the french side despite experience and so called military genius every effort 
was directed to pushing on to moscow at the end of the summer that is 
to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction in historical works 
on the year 1812 french writers are very fond of saying that napoleon felt the 
danger of extending his line that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised 
him to stop at smolénsk and of making similar statements to show that the danger 
of the campaign was even then understood russian authors are still fonder of telling us 
that from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war plan was adopted to lure 
napoleon into the depths of russia and this plan some of them attribute to pfuel 
others to a certain frenchman others to toll and others again to alexander to notes 
projects and letters which contain hints of such a line of action but all these 
hints at what happened both from the french side and the russian are advanced only 
because they fit in with the event had that event not occurred these hints would 
have been forgotten as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations 
to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event 
falsified them there are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event 
that however it may end there will always be people to say said then that 
it would be so quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite 
the contrary effect conjectures as to awareness of the danger of extending his line and 
on the russian side as to luring the enemy into the depths of russia are 
evidently of that kind and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to 
napoleon and his marshals or such plans to the russian commanders all the facts are 
in flat contradiction to such conjectures during the whole period of the war not only 
was there no wish on the russian side to draw the french into the heart 
of the country but from their first entry into russia everything was done to stop 
them and not only was napoleon not afraid to extend his line but he welcomed 
every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in 
former campaigns but very lazily at the very beginning of the war our armies were 
divided and our sole aim was to unite them though uniting the armies was no 
advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the 
country our emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of russian 
soil and not to retreat the enormous drissa camp was formed on plan and there 
was no intention of retiring farther the emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every 
step they retired he could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach 
smolénsk still less could he contemplate the burning of moscow and when our armies did 
unite he was displeased that smolénsk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having 
been fought under its walls so thought the emperor and the russian commanders and people 
were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths 
of the country napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and 
missed several chances of forcing an engagement in august he was at smolénsk and thought 
only of how to advance farther though as we now see that advance was evidently 
ruinous to him the facts clearly show that napoleon did not foresee the danger of 
the advance on moscow nor did alexander and the russian commanders then think of luring 
napoleon on but quite the contrary the luring of napoleon into the depths of the 
country was not the result of any plan for no one believed it to be 
possible it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues aims and wishes among those 
who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable or 
of the one way of saving russia everything came about fortuitously the armies were divided 
at the commencement of the campaign we tried to unite them with the evident intention 
of giving battle and checking the advance and by this effort to unite them while 
avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute 
led the french on to smolénsk but we withdrew at an acute angle not only 
because the french advanced between our two armies the angle became still more acute and 
we withdrew still farther because barclay de tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by bagratión 
who would come under his command and in command of the second to postpone joining 
up and coming under command as long as he could bagratión was slow in effecting 
the that was the chief aim of all at as he alleged he exposed his 
army to danger on this march and it was best for him to retire more 
to the left and more to the south worrying the enemy from flank and rear 
and securing from the ukraine recruits for his army and it looks as if he 
planned this in order not to come under the command of the detested foreigner barclay 
whose rank was inferior to his own the emperor was with the army to encourage 
it but his presence and ignorance of what steps to take and the enormous number 
of advisers and plans destroyed the first energy and it retired the intention was to 
make a stand at the drissa camp but paulucci aiming at becoming commander in chief 
unexpectedly employed his energy to influence alexander and whole plan was abandoned and the command 
entrusted to barclay but as barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited the 
armies were divided there was no unity of command and barclay was unpopular but from 
this confusion division and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief there resulted on 
the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle which we could not have 
refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else instead of barclay been 
in command and on the other an ever increasing indignation against the foreigners and an 
increase in patriotic zeal at last the emperor left the army and as the most 
convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was 
necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in 
general to a patriotic war and by this visit of the emperor to moscow the 
strength of the russian army was trebled he left in order not to obstruct the 
commander in undivided control of the army and hoping that more decisive action would then 
be taken but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled bennigsen 
the tsarévich and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the 
commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy and barclay feeling less free than 
ever under the observation of all these of the emperor became still more cautious of 
undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle barclay stood for caution the tsarévich hinted 
at treachery and demanded a general engagement lubomírski bronnítski wlocki and the others of that 
group stirred up so much trouble that barclay under pretext of sending papers to the 
emperor dispatched these polish adjutants general to petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with 
bennigsen and the tsarévich at smolénsk the armies at last reunited much as bagratión disliked 
it bagratión drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by barclay barclay donned 
his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior officer bagratión despite 
his seniority in rank bagratión in this contest of magnanimity took his orders from barclay 
but having submitted agreed with him less than ever by the orders bagratión reported direct 
to him he wrote to arakchéev the confidant must be as my sovereign pleases but 
i cannot work with the minister meaning barclay for sake send me somewhere else if 
only in command of a regiment i cannot stand it here headquarters are so full 
of germans that a russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything i 
thought i was really serving my sovereign and the fatherland but it turns out that 
i am serving barclay i confess i do not want to the swarm of bronnítskis 
and wintzingerodes and their like still further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief 
and even less unity resulted preparations were made to fight the french before smolénsk a 
general was sent to survey the position this general hating barclay rode to visit a 
friend of his own a corps commander and having spent the day with him returned 
to barclay and condemned as unsuitable from every point of view the battleground he had 
not seen while disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of battle 
and while we were looking for the lost touch with french stumbled upon division and 
reached the walls of smolénsk it was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolénsk 
to save our lines of communication the battle was fought and thousands were killed on 
both sides smolénsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and of the 
whole people but smolénsk was burned by its own inhabitants who had been misled by 
their governor and these ruined inhabitants setting an example to other russians went to moscow 
thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe napoleon advanced farther 
and we retired thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction chapter ii 
the day after his son had left prince nicholas sent for princess mary to come 
to his study are you satisfied now said he made me quarrel with my son 
satisfied are you all you wanted satisfied it hurts me it hurts old and weak 
and this is what you wanted well then gloat over it gloat over it after 
that princess mary did not see her father for a whole week he was ill 
and did not leave his study princess mary noticed to her surprise that during this 
illness the old prince not only excluded her from his room but did not admit 
mademoiselle bourienne either tíkhon alone attended him at the end of the week the prince 
reappeared and resumed his former way of life devoting himself with special activity to building 
operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations with mademoiselle 
bourienne his looks and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say you see you 
plotted against me you lied to prince andrew about my relations with that frenchwoman and 
made me quarrel with him but you see i need neither her nor you princess 
mary spent half of every day with little nicholas watching his lessons teaching him russian 
and music herself and talking to dessalles the rest of the day she spent over 
her books with her old nurse or with who sometimes came by the back door 
to see her of the war princess mary thought as women do think about wars 
she feared for her brother who was in it was horrified by and amazed at 
the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another but she did not understand 
the significance of this war which seemed to her like all previous wars she did 
not realize the significance of this war though dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was 
passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to 
her and though the who came to see her reported in their own way the 
rumors current among the people of an invasion by antichrist and though julie now princess 
drubetskáya who had resumed correspondence with her wrote patriotic letters from moscow write you in 
russian my good friend wrote julie in her frenchified russian i have a detestation for 
all the french and the same for their language which i cannot support to hear 
spoken we in moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored emperor poor husband is 
enduring pains and hunger in jewish taverns but the news which i have inspires me 
yet more heard probably of the heroic exploit of raévski embracing his two sons and 
saying will perish with them but we will not be shaken and truly though the 
enemy was twice stronger than we we were unshakable we pass the time as we 
can but in war as in war the princesses aline and sophie sit whole days 
with me and we unhappy widows of live men make beautiful conversations over our charpie 
only you my friend are missing and so on the chief reason princess mary did 
not realize the full significance of this war was that the old prince never spoke 
of it did not recognize it and laughed at dessalles when he mentioned it at 
dinner the tone was so calm and confident that princess mary unhesitatingly believed him all 
that july the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated he planned another garden 
and began a new building for the domestic serfs the only thing that made princess 
mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and instead of sleeping in 
his study as usual changed his sleeping place every day one day he would order 
his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery another day he remained 
on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there 
without undressing of mademoiselle serf boy read to him then again he would spend a 
night in the dining room on august 1 a second letter was received from prince 
andrew in his first letter which came soon after he had left home prince andrew 
had dutifully asked his forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged 
to be restored to his favor to this letter the old prince had replied affectionately 
and from that time had kept the frenchwoman at a distance prince second letter written 
near vítebsk after the french had occupied that town gave a brief account of the 
whole campaign enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the 
further progress of the war in this letter prince andrew pointed out to his father 
the danger of staying at bald hills so near the theater of war and on 
the direct line of march and advised him to move to moscow at dinner that 
day on mentioning that the french were said to have already entered vítebsk the old 
prince remembered his letter was a letter from prince andrew today he said to princess 
you read it father she replied in a frightened voice she could not have read 
the letter as she did not even know it had arrived writes about this war 
said the prince with the ironic smile that had become habitual to him in speaking 
of the present war must be very interesting said dessalles andrew is in a position 
to know very interesting said mademoiselle bourienne and get it for me said the old 
prince to mademoiselle bourienne the paperweight on the little table mademoiselle bourienne jumped up eagerly 
he exclaimed with a frown go michael ivánovich michael ivánovich rose and went to the 
study but as soon as he had left the room the old prince looking uneasily 
round threw down his napkin and went himself do anything always make some muddle he 
muttered while he was away princess mary dessalles mademoiselle bourienne and even little nicholas exchanged 
looks in silence the old prince returned with quick steps accompanied by michael ivánovich bringing 
the letter and a plan these he put down beside letting anyone read them at 
dinner on moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to princess mary and 
spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes upon 
it told her to read the letter aloud when she had done so princess mary 
looked inquiringly at her father he was examining the plan evidently engrossed in his own 
ideas do you think of it prince dessalles ventured to ask i said the prince 
as if unpleasantly awakened and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building 
possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that ha ha the 
theater of war said the prince have said and still say that the theater of 
war is poland and the enemy will never get beyond the niemen dessalles looked in 
amazement at the prince who was talking of the niemen when the enemy was already 
at the dnieper but princess mary forgetting the geographical position of the niemen thought that 
what her father was saying was correct the snow melts sink in the polish swamps 
only they could fail to see it the prince continued evidently thinking of the campaign 
of 1807 which seemed to him so recent should have advanced into prussia sooner then 
things would have taken a different turn prince dessalles began timidly letter mentions vítebsk the 
letter yes replied the prince peevishly yes his face suddenly took on a morose expression 
he paused he writes that the french were beaten at at what river is it 
dessalles dropped his eyes prince says nothing about that he remarked gently he but i 
invent it myself no one spoke for a long time yes well michael ivánovich he 
suddenly went on raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building me 
how you mean to alter it michael ivánovich went up to the plan and the 
prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at princess mary and dessalles 
and went to his own room princess mary saw embarrassed and astonished look fixed on 
her father noticed his silence and was struck by the fact that her father had 
forgotten his letter on the drawing room table but she was not only afraid to 
speak of it and ask dessalles the reason of his confusion and silence but was 
afraid even to think about it in the evening michael ivánovich sent by the prince 
came to princess mary for prince letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room 
she gave it to him and unpleasant as it was to her to do so 
ventured to ask him what her father was doing busy replied michael ivánovich with a 
respectfully ironic smile which caused princess mary to turn pale worrying very much about the 
new building he has been reading a little but ivánovich went on lowering his at 
his desk busy with his will i expect one of the favorite occupations of late 
had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and 
which he called his alpátych is being sent to smolénsk asked princess mary yes he 
has been waiting to start for some time chapter iii when michael ivánovich returned to 
the study with the letter the old prince with spectacles on and a shade over 
his eyes was sitting at his open bureau with screened candles holding a paper in 
his outstretched hand and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his as he termed 
was to be transmitted to the emperor after his death when michael ivánovich went in 
there were tears in the eyes evoked by the memory of the time when the 
paper he was now reading had been written he took the letter from michael hand 
put it in his pocket folded up his papers and called in alpátych who had 
long been waiting the prince had a list of things to be bought in smolénsk 
and walking up and down the room past alpátych who stood by the door he 
gave his instructions you hear eight quires like this sample gilt edged it must be 
exactly like the sample varnish sealing wax as in michael list he paced up and 
down for a while and glanced at his notes hand to the governor in person 
a letter about the deed next bolts for the doors of the new building were 
wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed and 
a leather case had to be ordered to keep the in the instructions to alpátych 
took over two hours and still the prince did not let him go he sat 
down sank into thought closed his eyes and dozed off alpátych made a slight movement 
go go if anything more is wanted send after you alpátych went out the prince 
again went to his bureau glanced into it fingered his papers closed the bureau again 
and sat down at the table to write to the governor it was already late 
when he rose after sealing the letter he wished to sleep but he knew he 
would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts came to him in bed 
so he called tíkhon and went through the rooms with him to show him where 
to set up the bed for that night he went about looking at every corner 
every place seemed unsatisfactory but worst of all was his customary couch in the study 
that couch was dreadful to him probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had 
when lying there it was unsatisfactory everywhere but the corner behind the piano in the 
sitting room was better than other places he had never slept there yet with the 
help of a footman tíkhon brought in the bedstead and began putting it up not 
right not right cried the prince and himself pushed it a few inches from the 
corner and then closer in again at last finished now rest thought the prince and 
let tíkhon undress him frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of 
his coat and trousers the prince undressed sat down heavily on the bed and appeared 
to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered yellow legs he was not 
meditating but only deferring the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up 
and turn over on the bed how hard it is oh that this toil might 
end and you would release me thought he pressing his lips together he made that 
effort for the twenty thousandth time and lay down but hardly had he done so 
before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if it were 
breathing heavily and jolting this happened to him almost every night he opened his eyes 
as they were closing peace damn them he muttered angry he knew not with whom 
yes there was something else important very important that i was keeping till i should 
be in bed the bolts no i told him about them no it was something 
something in the drawing room princess mary talked some nonsense dessalles that fool said something 
something in my remember what did we talk about at dinner prince michael quiet quiet 
the prince slapped his hand on the table i know prince letter princess mary read 
it dessalles said something about vítebsk now read it he had the letter taken from 
his pocket and the which stood a glass of lemonade and a spiral wax close 
to the bed and putting on his spectacles he began reading only now in the 
stillness of the night reading it by the faint light under the green shade did 
he grasp its meaning for a moment french at vítebsk in four march they may 
be at smolénsk perhaps are already there tíkhon tíkhon jumped up no i want anything 
he shouted he put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes and there 
rose before him the danube at bright noonday reeds the russian camp and himself a 
young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face vigorous and alert entering gaily colored 
tent and a burning sense of jealousy of agitated him now as strongly as it 
had done then he recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with potëmkin 
and he saw before him a plump rather sallow faced short stout woman the empress 
mother with her smile and her words at her first gracious reception of him and 
then that same face on the catafalque and the encounter he had with zúbov over 
her coffin about his right to kiss her hand quicker quicker to get back to 
that time and have done with all the present quicker that they should leave me 
in peace chapter iv bald hills prince nicholas estate lay forty miles east from smolénsk 
and two miles from the main road to moscow the same evening that the prince 
gave his instructions to alpátych dessalles having asked to see princess mary told her that 
as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his 
safety though from prince letter it was evident that to remain at bald hills might 
be dangerous he respectfully advised her to send a letter by alpátych to the provincial 
governor at smolénsk asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the 
extent of the danger to which bald hills was exposed dessalles wrote this letter to 
the governor for princess mary she signed it and it was given to alpátych with 
instructions to hand it to the governor and to come back as quickly as possible 
if there was danger having received all his orders alpátych wearing a white beaver present 
from the carrying a stick as the prince did went out accompanied by his family 
three well fed roans stood ready harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood 
the larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed with paper 
the prince allowed no one at bald hills to drive with ringing bells but on 
a long journey alpátych liked to have them his senior clerk a countinghouse clerk a 
scullery maid a cook two old women a little pageboy the coachman and various domestic 
seeing him off his daughter placed chintz covered down cushions for him to sit on 
and behind his back his old sister in law popped in a small bundle and 
one of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle there fuss women women said alpátych 
puffing and speaking rapidly just as the prince did and he climbed into the trap 
after giving the clerk orders about the work to be done alpátych not trying to 
imitate the prince now lifted the hat from his bald head and crossed himself three 
times there is anything come back yákov alpátych for sake think of us cried his 
wife referring to the rumors of war and the enemy women fuss muttered alpátych to 
himself and started on his journey looking round at the fields of yellow rye and 
the still green thickly growing oats and at other quite black fields just being plowed 
a second time as he went along he looked with pleasure at the splendid crop 
of corn scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were already being reaped 
made his calculations as to the sowing and the harvest and asked himself whether he 
had not forgotten any of the orders having baited the horses twice on the way 
he arrived at the town toward evening on the fourth of august alpátych kept meeting 
and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the road as he approached smolénsk he heard 
the sounds of distant firing but these did not impress him what struck him most 
was the sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been 
pitched and which was being mown down by the soldiers evidently for fodder this fact 
impressed alpátych but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it all the 
interests of his life for more than thirty years had been bounded by the will 
of the prince and he never went beyond that limit everything not connected with the 
execution of the orders did not interest and did not even exist for alpátych on 
reaching smolénsk on the evening of the fourth of august he put up in the 
gáchina suburb across the dnieper at the inn kept by ferapóntov where he had been 
in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years some thirty years ago 
ferapóntov by advice had bought a wood from the prince had begun to trade and 
now had a house an inn and a corn shop in that province he was 
a stout dark red faced peasant in the forties with thick lips a broad knob 
of a nose similar knobs over his black frowning brows and a round belly wearing 
a waistcoat over his cotton shirt ferapóntov was standing before his shop which opened onto 
the street on seeing alpátych he went up to him welcome yákov alpátych folks are 
leaving the town but you have come to it said he are they leaving the 
town asked alpátych what i say folks are foolish always afraid of the french fuss 
fuss said alpátych what i think yákov alpátych what i say is orders have been 
given not to let them in so that must be right and the peasants are 
asking three rubles for christian yákov alpátych heard without heeding he asked for a samovar 
and for hay for his horses and when he had had his tea he went 
to bed all night long troops were moving past the inn next morning alpátych donned 
a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business it was a 
sunny morning and by eight it was already hot good day for harvesting thought alpátych 
from beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning at eight the booming 
of cannon was added to the sound of musketry many people were hurrying through the 
streets and there were many soldiers but cabs were still driving about tradesmen stood at 
their shops and service was being held in the churches as usual alpátych went to 
the shops to government offices to the post office and to the in the offices 
and shops and at the post office everyone was talking about the army and about 
the enemy who was already attacking the town everybody was asking what should be done 
and all were trying to calm one another in front of the house alpátych found 
a large number of people cossacks and a traveling carriage of the at the porch 
he met two of the landed gentry one of whom he knew this man an 
ex captain of police was saying angrily no joke you know all very well if 
single man though undone is but one as the proverb says but with thirteen in 
your family and all the property brought us to utter ruin what sort of governors 
are they to do that they ought to be brigands come enough said the other 
do i care let him hear not dogs said the ex captain of police and 
looking round he noticed alpátych yákov alpátych what have you come for see the governor 
by his order answered alpátych lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the 
bosom of his coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince has ordered 
me to inquire into the position of affairs he added go and find out shouted 
the angry gentleman brought things to such a pass that there are no carts or 
anything there it is again do you hear said he pointing in the direction whence 
came the sounds of firing brought us all to ruin the brigands he repeated and 
descended the porch steps alpátych swayed his head and went upstairs in the waiting room 
were tradesmen women and officials looking silently at one another the door of the room 
opened and they all rose and moved forward an official ran out said some words 
to a merchant called a stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to 
follow him and vanished again evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions addressed 
to him alpátych moved forward and next time the official came out addressed him one 
hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat and handed him two letters his 
honor baron asch from general in chief prince bolkónski he announced with such solemnity and 
significance that the official turned to him and took the letters a few minutes later 
the governor received alpátych and hurriedly said to him the prince and princess that i 
knew nothing i acted on the highest and he handed a paper to alpátych as 
the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to moscow i am 
just starting myself inform them but the governor did not finish a dusty perspiring officer 
ran into the room and began to say something in french the face expressed terror 
he said nodding his head to alpátych and began questioning the officer eager frightened helpless 
glances were turned on alpátych when he came out of the room involuntarily listening now 
to the firing which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength alpátych hurried to 
his inn the paper handed to him by the governor said this assure you that 
the town of smolénsk is not in the slightest danger as yet and it is 
unlikely that it will be threatened with any i from the one side and prince 
bagratión from the other are marching to unite our forces before smolénsk which junction will 
be effected on the 22nd instant and both armies with their united forces will defend 
our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts shall have beaten 
back the enemies of our fatherland or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks 
has perished from this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure 
the inhabitants of smolénsk for those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured 
of victory instructions from barclay de tolly to baron asch the civil governor of smolénsk 
1812 people were anxiously roaming about the streets carts piled high with household utensils chairs 
and cupboards kept emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets 
loaded carts stood at the house next to and women were wailing and lamenting as 
they said good by a small watchdog ran round barking in front of the harnessed 
horses alpátych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went straight to 
the shed where his horses and trap were the coachman was asleep he woke him 
up told him to harness and went into the passage from the room came the 
sounds of a child crying the despairing sobs of a woman and the hoarse angry 
shouting of ferapóntov the cook began running hither and thither in the passage like a 
frightened hen just as alpátych entered done her to death killed the mistress beat her 
dragged her about so for asked alpátych kept begging to go away a woman me 
away says she let me perish with my little children folks she says all gone 
so why she says we go and he began beating and pulling her about so 
at these words alpátych nodded as if in approval and not wishing to hear more 
went to the door of the room opposite the where he had left his purchases 
brute you murderer screamed a thin pale woman who with a baby in her arms 
and her kerchief torn from her head burst through the door at that moment and 
down the steps into the yard ferapóntov came out after her but on seeing alpátych 
adjusted his waistcoat smoothed his hair yawned and followed alpátych into the opposite room already 
said he alpátych without answering or looking at his host sorted his packages and asked 
how much he owed reckon up well have you been to the asked ferapóntov has 
been decided alpátych replied that the governor had not told him anything definite our business 
how can we get away said ferapóntov have to pay seven rubles a cartload to 
dorogobúzh and i tell them not christians to ask it selivánov now did a good 
stroke last flour to the army at nine rubles a sack will you have some 
tea he added while the horses were being harnessed alpátych and ferapóntov over their tea 
talked of the price of corn the crops and the good weather for harvesting it 
seems to be getting quieter remarked ferapóntov finishing his third cup of tea and getting 
up must have got the best of it the orders were not to let them 
in so in force it seems they say the other day matthew iványch plátov drove 
them into the river márina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day alpátych collected 
his parcels handed them to the coachman who had come in and settled up with 
the innkeeper the noise of wheels hoofs and bells was heard from the gateway as 
a little trap passed out it was by now late in the afternoon half the 
street was in shadow the other half brightly lit by the sun alpátych looked out 
of the window and went to the door suddenly the strange sound of a far 
off whistling and thud was heard followed by a boom of cannon blending into a 
dull roar that set the windows rattling he went out into the street two men 
were running past toward the bridge from different sides came whistling sounds and the thud 
of cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town but these sounds were hardly 
heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and attracted little 
attention from the inhabitants the town was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns 
which napoleon had ordered up after four the people did not at once realize the 
meaning of this bombardment at first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only 
aroused curiosity wife who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed became quiet 
and with the baby in her arms went to the gate listening to the sounds 
and looking in silence at the people the cook and a shop assistant came to 
the gate with lively curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as 
they flew over their heads several people came round the corner talking eagerly force remarked 
one the roof and ceiling all to splinters up the earth like a pig said 
another grand it bucks one up laughed the first you jumped aside or it would 
have wiped you out others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls 
had fallen on a house close to them meanwhile still more projectiles now with the 
swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball now with the agreeable intermittent whistle of a 
shell flew over heads incessantly but not one fell close by they all flew over 
alpátych was getting into his trap the innkeeper stood at the gate are you staring 
at he shouted to the cook who in her red skirt with sleeves rolled up 
swinging her bare elbows had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being 
said marvels she exclaimed but hearing her voice she turned back pulling down her tucked 
up skirt once more something whistled but this time quite close swooping downwards like a 
little bird a flame flashed in the middle of the street something exploded and the 
street was shrouded in smoke what are you doing shouted the innkeeper rushing to the 
cook at that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different sides the 
frightened baby began to cry and people crowded silently with pale faces round the cook 
the loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing h h dear souls dear kind 
souls let me die my good souls five minutes later no one remained in the 
street the cook with her thigh broken by a shell splinter had been carried into 
the kitchen alpátych his coachman wife and children and the house porter were all sitting 
in the cellar listening the roar of guns the whistling of projectiles and the piteous 
moaning of the cook which rose above the other sounds did not cease for a 
moment the mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar 
asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in 
the street a shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone with others 
to the cathedral whence they were fetching the wonder working icon of smolénsk toward dusk 
the cannonade began to subside alpátych left the cellar and stopped in the doorway the 
evening sky that had been so clear was clouded with smoke through which high up 
the sickle of the new moon shone strangely now that the terrible din of the 
guns had ceased a hush seemed to reign over the town broken only by the 
rustle of footsteps the moaning the distant cries and the crackle of fires which seemed 
widespread everywhere the moans had now subsided on two sides black curling clouds of smoke 
rose and spread from the fires through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or 
ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined ant hill several of them 
ran into yard before eyes alpátych went out to the gate a retreating regiment thronging 
and hurrying blocked the street noticing him an officer said town is being abandoned get 
away get away and then turning to the soldiers shouted teach you to run into 
the yards alpátych went back to the house called the coachman and told him to 
set off whole household came out too following alpátych and the coachman the women who 
had been silent till then suddenly began to wail as they looked at the smoke 
and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing as if in 
reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street inside 
the shed alpátych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of their horses 
with trembling hands as alpátych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten 
soldiers in open shop talking loudly and filling their bags and knapsacks with flour and 
sunflower seeds just then ferapóntov returned and entered his shop on seeing the soldiers he 
was about to shout at them but suddenly stopped and clutching at his hair burst 
into sobs and laughter everything lads let those devils get it he cried taking some 
bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street some of the soldiers were 
frightened and ran away others went on filling their bags on seeing alpátych ferapóntov turned 
to him is done for he cried set the place on fire myself done for 
and ferapóntov ran into the yard soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the 
street blocking it completely so that alpátych could not pass out and had to wait 
wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till it was possible to 
drive out night had come there were stars in the sky and the new moon 
shone out amid the smoke that screened it on the sloping descent to the dnieper 
cart and that of the wife which were slowly moving amid the rows of soldiers 
and of other vehicles had to stop in a side street near the crossroads where 
the vehicles had stopped a house and some shops were on fire this fire was 
already burning itself out the flames now died down and were lost in the black 
smoke now suddenly flared up again brightly lighting up with strange distinctness the faces of 
the people crowding at the crossroads black figures flitted about before the fire and through 
the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be heard seeing that his 
trap would not be able to move on for some time alpátych got down and 
turned into the side street to look at the fire soldiers were continually rushing backwards 
and forwards near it and he saw two of them and a man in a 
frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the street while others carried bundles 
of hay alpátych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which 
was blazing briskly the walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen 
in the wooden roof was collapsing and the rafters were alight the crowd was evidently 
watching for the roof to fall in and alpátych watched for it too a familiar 
voice suddenly hailed the old man on us your excellency answered alpátych immediately recognizing the 
voice of his young prince prince andrew in his riding cloak mounted on a black 
horse was looking at alpátych from the back of the crowd are you here he 
asked your excellency stammered alpátych and broke into sobs we really lost master are you 
here prince andrew repeated at that moment the flames flared up and showed his young 
pale worn face alpátych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it 
was to get away we really quite lost your excellency he asked again prince andrew 
without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee began writing in pencil on 
a page he tore out he wrote to his sister is being abandoned bald hills 
will be occupied by the enemy within a week set off immediately for moscow let 
me know at once when you will start send by special messenger to usvyázh having 
written this and given the paper to alpátych he told him how to arrange for 
departure of the prince the princess his son and the tutor and how and where 
to let him know immediately before he had had time to finish giving these instructions 
a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped up to him are a colonel 
shouted the chief of staff with a german accent in a voice familiar to prince 
andrew are set on fire in your presence and you stand by what does this 
mean you will answer for it shouted berg who was now assistant to the chief 
of staff of the commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first 
army a place as berg said agreeable and well en évidence prince andrew looked at 
him and without replying went on speaking to alpátych tell them that i shall await 
a reply till the tenth and if by the tenth i receive news that they 
have all got away i shall have to throw up everything and come myself to 
bald hills said berg recognizing prince andrew only spoke because i have to obey orders 
because i always do obey exactly you must please excuse me he went on apologetically 
something cracked in the flames the fire died down for a moment and wreaths of 
black smoke rolled from under the roof there was another terrible crash and something huge 
collapsed rou rou yelled the crowd echoing the crash of the collapsing roof of the 
barn the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all around the flames flared 
up again lighting the animated delighted exhausted faces of the spectators the man in the 
frieze coat raised his arms and shouted fine lads now raging fine the owner himself 
cried several voices then continued prince andrew to alpátych to them as i have told 
and not replying a word to berg who was now mute beside him he touched 
his horse and rode down the side street chapter v from smolénsk the troops continued 
to retreat followed by the enemy on the tenth of august the regiment prince andrew 
commanded was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to bald hills heat and 
drought had continued for more than three weeks each day fleecy clouds floated across the 
sky and occasionally veiled the sun but toward evening the sky cleared again and the 
sun set in reddish brown mist heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth the unreaped 
corn was scorched and shed its grain the marshes dried up the cattle lowed from 
hunger finding no food on the sun parched meadows only at night and in the 
forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness but on the road the highroad 
along which the troops marched there was no such freshness even at night or when 
the road passed through the forest the dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned 
up more than six inches deep as soon as day dawned the march began the 
artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very 
hubs of the wheels and the infantry sank ankle deep in that soft choking hot 
dust that never cooled even at night some of this dust was kneaded by the 
feet and wheels while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops 
settling in eyes ears hair and nostrils and worst of all in the lungs of 
the men and beasts as they moved along that road the higher the sun rose 
the higher rose that cloud of dust and through the screen of its hot fine 
particles one could look with naked eye at the sun which showed like a huge 
crimson ball in the unclouded sky there was no wind and the men choked in 
that motionless atmosphere they marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths when they 
passed through a village they all rushed to the wells and fought for the water 
and drank it down to the mud prince andrew was in command of a regiment 
and the management of that regiment the welfare of the men and the necessity of 
receiving and giving orders engrossed him the burning of smolénsk and its abandonment made an 
epoch in his life a novel feeling of anger against the foe made him forget 
his own sorrow he was entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was 
considerate and kind to his men and officers in the regiment they called him prince 
were proud of him and loved him but he was kind and gentle only to 
those of his regiment to timókhin and the quite new to him belonging to a 
different world and who could not know and understand his past as soon as he 
came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staff he bristled up immediately and 
grew spiteful ironical and contemptuous everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to 
him and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying 
to do his duty and not to be unfair in truth everything presented itself in 
a dark and gloomy light to prince andrew especially after the abandonment of smolénsk on 
the sixth of august he considered that it could and should have been defended and 
after his sick father had had to flee to moscow abandoning to pillage his dearly 
beloved bald hills which he had built and peopled but despite this thanks to his 
regiment prince andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions two days 
previously he had received news that his father son and sister had left for moscow 
and though there was nothing for him to do at bald hills prince andrew with 
a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride there he 
ordered his horse to be saddled and leaving his regiment on the march rode to 
his estate where he had been born and spent his childhood riding past the pond 
where there used always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen 
or beat it with wooden beetles prince andrew noticed that there was not a soul 
about and that the little washing wharf torn from its place and half submerged was 
floating on its side in the middle of the pond he rode to the lodge 
no one was at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood 
open grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths and horses and calves 
were straying in the english park prince andrew rode up to the hothouse some of 
the glass panes were broken and of the trees in tubs some were overturned and 
others dried up he called for tarás the gardener but no one replied having gone 
round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden he saw that the carved 
garden fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with 
the fruit an old peasant whom prince andrew in his childhood had often seen at 
the gate was sitting on a green garden seat plaiting a bast shoe he was 
deaf and did not hear prince andrew ride up he was sitting on the seat 
the old prince used to like to sit on and beside him strips of bast 
were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia prince andrew rode up 
to the house several limes in the old garden had been cut down and a 
piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes 
the shutters were all closed except at one window which was open a little serf 
boy seeing prince andrew ran into the house alpátych having sent his family away was 
alone at bald hills and was sitting indoors reading the lives of the saints on 
hearing that prince andrew had come he went out with his spectacles on his nose 
buttoning his coat and hastily stepping up without a word began weeping and kissing prince 
knee then vexed at his own weakness he turned away and began to report on 
the position of affairs everything precious and valuable had been removed to boguchárovo seventy quarters 
of grain had also been carted away the hay and the spring corn of which 
alpátych said there had been a remarkable crop that year had been commandeered by the 
troops and mown down while still green the peasants were ruined some of them too 
had gone to boguchárovo only a few remained without waiting to hear him out prince 
andrew asked did my father and sister leave meaning when did they leave for moscow 
alpátych understanding the question to refer to their departure for boguchárovo replied that they had 
left on the seventh and again went into details concerning the estate management asking for 
instructions i to let the troops have the oats and to take a receipt for 
them we have still six hundred quarters left he inquired am i to say to 
him thought prince andrew looking down on the old bald head shining in the sun 
and seeing by the expression on his face that the old man himself understood how 
untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief let them have 
it replied prince andrew you noticed some disorder in the garden said alpátych was impossible 
to prevent it three regiments have been here and spent the night dragoons mostly i 
took down the name and rank of their commanding officer to hand in a complaint 
about it and what are you going to do will you stay here if the 
enemy occupies the place asked prince andrew alpátych turned his face to prince andrew looked 
at him and suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm is my refuge his 
will be done he exclaimed a group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow 
toward the prince good by said prince andrew bending over to alpátych must go away 
too take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the ryazán 
estate or to the one near moscow alpátych clung to prince leg and burst into 
sobs gently disengaging himself the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue at 
a gallop the old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden like a fly 
impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead tapping the last on 
which he was making the bast shoe and two little girls running out from the 
hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from the trees there came 
upon prince andrew on seeing the young master the elder one with frightened look clutched 
her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree not 
stopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped prince andrew turned away with 
startled haste unwilling to let them see that they had been observed he was sorry 
for the pretty frightened little girl was afraid of looking at her and yet felt 
an irresistible desire to do so a new sensation of comfort and relief came over 
him when seeing these girls he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof 
from his own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him evidently these girls 
passionately desired one carry away and eat those green plums without being prince andrew shared 
their wish for the success of their enterprise he could not resist looking at them 
once more believing their danger past they sprang from their ambush and chirruping something in 
their shrill little voices and holding up their skirts their bare little sunburned feet scampered 
merrily and quickly across the meadow grass prince andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden 
off the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving but not far from bald 
hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting 
place by the dam of a small pond it was past one the sun a 
red ball through the dust burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat 
the dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting 
troops there was no wind as he crossed the dam prince andrew smelled the ooze 
and freshness of the pond he longed to get into that water however dirty it 
might be and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks 
and laughter the small muddy green pond had risen visibly more than a foot flooding 
the dam because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick 
red hands necks and faces who were splashing about in it all this naked white 
human flesh laughing and shrieking floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into 
a watering can and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially 
pathetic one fair haired young soldier of the third company whom prince andrew knew and 
who had a strap round the calf of one leg crossed himself stepped back to 
get a good run and plunged into the water another a dark noncommissioned officer who 
was always shaggy stood up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular 
figure and snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands 
blackened to the wrists there were sounds of men slapping one another yelling and puffing 
everywhere on the bank on the dam and in the pond there was healthy white 
muscular flesh the officer timókhin with his red little nose standing on the dam wiping 
himself with a towel felt confused at seeing the prince but made up his mind 
to address him nevertheless very nice your excellency you like to said he dirty replied 
prince andrew making a grimace clear it out for you in a minute said timókhin 
and still undressed ran off to clear the men out of the pond prince wants 
to bathe prince ours said many voices and the men were in such haste to 
clear out that the prince could hardly stop them he decided that he would rather 
wash himself with water in the barn bodies cannon fodder he thought and he looked 
at his own naked body and shuddered not from cold but from a sense of 
disgust and horror he did not himself understand aroused by the sight of that immense 
number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond on the seventh of august prince 
bagratión wrote as follows from his quarters at mikháylovna on the smolénsk road dear count 
aléxis he was writing to arakchéev but knew that his letter would be read by 
the emperor and therefore weighed every word in it to the best of his ability 
i expect the minister barclay de tolly has already reported the abandonment of smolénsk to 
the enemy it is pitiable and sad and the whole army is in despair that 
this most important place has been wantonly abandoned i for my part begged him personally 
most urgently and finally wrote him but nothing would induce him to consent i swear 
to you on my honor that napoleon was in such a fix as never before 
and might have lost half his army but could not have taken smolénsk our troops 
fought and are fighting as never before with fifteen thousand men i held the enemy 
at bay for thirty five hours and beat him but he would not hold out 
even for fourteen hours it is disgraceful a stain on our army and as for 
him he ought it seems to me not to live if he reports that our 
losses were great it is not true perhaps about four thousand not more and not 
even that but even were they ten thousand war but the enemy has lost masses 
what would it have cost him to hold out for another two days they would 
have had to retire of their own accord for they had no water for men 
or horses he gave me his word he would not retreat but suddenly sent instructions 
that he was retiring that night we cannot fight in this way or we may 
soon bring the enemy to moscow there is a rumor that you are thinking of 
peace god forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane 
retreats you would set all russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed 
to wear the uniform if it has come to must fight as long as russia 
can and as long as there are men able to stand one man ought to 
be in command and not two your minister may perhaps be good as a minister 
but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable yet to him is 
entrusted the fate of our whole country i am really frantic with vexation forgive my 
writing boldly it is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace 
and that the minister should command the army does not love our sovereign and desires 
the ruin of us all so i write you frankly call out the militia for 
the minister is leading these visitors after him to moscow in a most masterly way 
the whole army feels great suspicion of the imperial aide de camp wolzogen he is 
said to be more man than ours and he is always advising the minister i 
am not merely civil to him but obey him like a corporal though i am 
his senior this is painful but loving my benefactor and sovereign i submit only i 
am sorry for the emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he 
consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital 
more than fifteen thousand men and had we attacked this would not have happened tell 
me for sake what will russia our mother russia say to our being so frightened 
and why are we abandoning our good and gallant fatherland to such rabble and implanting 
feelings of hatred and shame in all our subjects what are we scared at and 
of whom are we afraid i am not to blame that the minister is vacillating 
a coward dense dilatory and has all bad qualities the whole army bewails it and 
calls down curses upon him chapter vi among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena 
of human life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails and those in 
which form prevails to the distinguished from village country provincial or even moscow may allot 
petersburg life and especially the life of its salons that life of the salons is 
unchanging since the year 1805 we had made peace and had again quarreled with bonaparte 
and had made constitutions and unmade them again but the salons of anna pávlovna and 
hélène remained just as they had one seven and the other five years before at 
anna they talked with perplexity of successes just as before and saw in them and 
in the subservience shown to him by the european sovereigns a malicious conspiracy the sole 
object of which was to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which 
anna pávlovna was the representative and in salon which rumyántsev himself honored with his visits 
regarding hélène as a remarkably intelligent woman they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 
as in 1808 of the and the man and regretted our rupture with france a 
rupture which according to them ought to be promptly terminated by peace of late since 
the return from the army there had been some excitement in these conflicting salon circles 
and some demonstrations of hostility to one another but each camp retained its own tendency 
in anna circle only those frenchmen were admitted who were deep rooted legitimists and patriotic 
views were expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to the french 
theater and that to maintain the french troupe was costing the government as much as 
a whole army corps the progress of the war was eagerly followed and only the 
reports most flattering to our army were circulated in the french circle of hélène and 
rumyántsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted 
and all attempts at conciliation were discussed in that circle they discountenanced those who advised 
hurried preparations for a removal to kazán of the court and the educational establishments under 
the patronage of the dowager empress in circle the war in general was regarded as 
a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace and the view 
prevailed expressed by now in petersburg was quite at home in house which every clever 
man was obliged to not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters 
be settled in that circle the moscow of which had reached petersburg simultaneously with the 
ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly though with much caution anna circle on the contrary was 
enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as plutarch speaks of the deeds of 
the ancients prince vasíli who still occupied his former important posts formed a connecting link 
between these two circles he visited his friend anna as well as his salon and 
often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said 
at what he should have said at anna and vice versa soon after the return 
prince vasíli in a conversation about the war at anna severely condemned barclay de tolly 
but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief one of 
the visitors usually spoken of as man of great merit having described how he had 
that day seen kutúzov the newly chosen chief of the petersburg militia presiding over the 
enrollment of recruits at the treasury cautiously ventured to suggest that kutúzov would be the 
man to satisfy all requirements anna pávlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that kutúzov had 
done nothing but cause the emperor annoyance have talked and talked at the assembly of 
the nobility prince vasíli interrupted they did not listen to me i told them his 
election as chief of the militia would not please the emperor they did not listen 
to me all this mania for opposition he went on who for it is all 
because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those muscovites prince vasíli continued forgetting 
for a moment that though at one had to ridicule the moscow enthusiasm at anna 
one had to be ecstatic about it but he retrieved his mistake at once is 
it suitable that count kutúzov the oldest general in russia should preside at that tribunal 
he will get nothing for his pains how could they make a man commander in 
chief who cannot mount a horse who drops asleep at a council and has the 
very worst morals a good reputation he made for himself at bucharest i speak of 
his capacity as a general but at a time like this how they appoint a 
decrepit blind old man positively blind a fine idea to have a blind general he 
see anything to play bulff he see at all no one replied to his remarks 
this was quite correct on the twenty fourth of july but on the twenty ninth 
of july kutúzov received the title of prince this might indicate a wish to get 
rid of him and therefore prince opinion continued to be correct though he was not 
now in any hurry to express it but on the eighth of august a committee 
consisting of field marshal saltykóv arakchéev vyazmítinov lopukhín and kochubéy met to consider the progress 
of the war this committee came to the conclusion that our failures were due to 
a want of unity in the command and though the members of the committee were 
aware of the dislike of kutúzov after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his 
appointment as commander in chief that same day kutúzov was appointed commander in chief with 
full powers over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them on the 
ninth of august prince vasíli at anna again met the of great merit the latter 
was very attentive to anna pávlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one 
of the educational establishments for young ladies prince vasíli entered the room with the air 
of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires have you heard 
the great news prince kutúzov is field marshal all dissensions are at an end i 
am so glad so delighted at last we have a man said he glancing sternly 
and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room the of great merit despite his 
desire to obtain the post of director could not refrain from reminding prince vasíli of 
his former opinion though this was impolite to prince vasíli in anna drawing room and 
also to anna pávlovna herself who had received the news with delight he could not 
resist the temptation prince they say he is blind said he reminding prince vasíli of 
his own words nonsense he sees well enough said prince vasíli rapidly in a deep 
voice and with a slight voice and cough with which he was wont to dispose 
of all difficulties sees well enough he added what i am so pleased about he 
went on that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the armies and 
the whole no commander in chief ever had before he is a second autocrat he 
concluded with a victorious smile grant it god grant it said anna pávlovna the of 
great merit who was still a novice in court circles wishing to flatter anna pávlovna 
by defending her former position on this question observed is said that the emperor was 
reluctant to give kutúzov those powers they say he blushed like a girl to whom 
joconde is read when he said to kutúzov emperor and the fatherland award you this 
honor the heart took no part in that speech said anna pávlovna no no warmly 
rejoined prince vasíli who would not now yield kutúzov to anyone in his opinion kutúzov 
was not only admirable himself but was adored by everybody impossible said he our sovereign 
appreciated him so highly before grant only that prince kutúzov assumes real power and does 
not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel observed anna pávlovna understanding at 
once to whom she alluded prince vasíli said in a whisper know for a fact 
that kutúzov made it an absolute condition that the tsarévich should not be with the 
army do you know what he said to the emperor and prince vasíli repeated the 
words supposed to have been spoken by kutúzov to the emperor can neither punish him 
if he does wrong nor reward him if he does right a very wise man 
is prince kutúzov i have known him a long time even say remarked the of 
great who did not yet possess courtly tact his excellency made it an express condition 
that the sovereign himself should not be with the army as soon as he said 
this both prince vasíli and anna pávlovna turned away from him and glanced sadly at 
one another with a sigh at his naïveté chapter vii while this was taking place 
in petersburg the french had already passed smolénsk and were drawing nearer and nearer to 
moscow historian thiers like other of his historians trying to justify his hero says that 
he was drawn to the walls of moscow against his will he is as right 
as other historians who look for the explanation of historic events in the will of 
one man he is as right as the russian historians who maintain that napoleon was 
drawn to moscow by the skill of the russian commanders here besides the law of 
retrospection which regards all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur the 
law of reciprocity comes in confusing the whole matter a good chessplayer having lost a 
game is sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made and looks 
for that mistake in the opening but forgets that at each stage of the game 
there were similar mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect he only notices 
the mistake to which he pays attention because his opponent took advantage of it how 
much more complex than this is the game of war which occurs under certain limits 
of time and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless objects but everything 
results from innumerable conflicts of various wills after smolénsk napoleon sought a battle beyond dorogobúzh 
at vyázma and then at tsárevo zaymíshche but it happened that owing to a conjunction 
of innumerable circumstances the russians could not give battle till they reached borodinó seventy miles 
from moscow from vyázma napoleon ordered a direct advance on moscow moscou la capitale asiatique 
de ce grand empire la ville sacrée des peuples moscou avec ses innombrables églises en 
forme de pagodes chinoises this moscow gave imagination no rest on the march from vyázma 
to tsárevo zaymíshche he rode his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his guards his 
bodyguard his pages and aides de camp berthier his chief of staff dropped behind to 
question a russian prisoner captured by the cavalry followed by lelorgne an interpreter he overtook 
napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression the asiatic 
capital of this great empire the sacred city of people moscow with its innumerable churches 
shaped like chinese pagodas asked napoleon of cossacks says that corps is joining up with 
the main army and that kutúzov has been appointed commander in chief he is a 
very shrewd and garrulous fellow napoleon smiled and told them to give the cossack a 
horse and bring the man to him he wished to talk to him himself several 
adjutants galloped off and an hour later lavrúshka the serf denísov had handed over to 
rostóv rode up to napoleon in an jacket and on a french cavalry saddle with 
a merry and tipsy face napoleon told him to ride by his side and began 
questioning him are a cossack a cossack your honor cossack not knowing in what company 
he was for plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an oriental 
mind the presence of a monarch talked with extreme familiarity of the incidents of the 
war says thiers narrating this episode in reality lavrúshka having got drunk the day before 
and left his master dinnerless had been whipped and sent to the village in quest 
of chickens where he engaged in looting till the french took him prisoner lavrúshka was 
one of those coarse bare faced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things consider 
it necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way are ready to render 
any sort of service to their master and are keen at guessing their baser impulses 
especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness finding himself in the company of napoleon whose 
identity he had easily and surely recognized lavrúshka was not in the least abashed but 
merely did his utmost to gain his new favor he knew very well that this 
was napoleon but presence could no more intimidate him than or a sergeant with the 
rods would have done for he had nothing that either the sergeant major or napoleon 
could deprive him of so he rattled on telling all the gossip he had heard 
among the orderlies much of it true but when napoleon asked him whether the russians 
thought they would beat bonaparte or not lavrúshka screwed up his eyes and considered in 
this question he saw subtle cunning as men of his type see cunning in everything 
so he frowned and did not answer immediately like this he said thoughtfully a battle 
soon yours will win right but if three days pass then after that well then 
that same battle will not soon be over lelorgne smilingly interpreted this speech to napoleon 
thus a battle takes place within the next three days the french will win but 
if later god knows what will happen napoleon did not smile though he was evidently 
in high good humor and he ordered these words to be repeated lavrúshka noticed this 
and to entertain him further pretending not to know who napoleon was added know that 
you have bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the world but we are 
a different matter knowing why or how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at 
the end the interpreter translated these words without the last phrase and bonaparte smiled young 
cossack made his mighty interlocutor smile says thiers after riding a few paces in silence 
napoleon turned to berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he 
was talking to the emperor himself to that very emperor who had written his immortally 
victorious name on the pyramids would affect this enfant du don of the don the 
fact was accordingly conveyed to lavrúshka lavrúshka understanding that this was done to perplex him 
and that napoleon expected him to be frightened to gratify his new masters promptly pretended 
to be astonished and awe struck opened his eyes wide and assumed the expression he 
usually put on when taken to be whipped soon as interpreter had spoken says thiers 
cossack seized by amazement did not utter another word but rode on his eyes fixed 
on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the east all 
his loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by a naïve and silent feeling of admiration 
napoleon after making the cossack a present had him set free like a bird restored 
to its native fields napoleon rode on dreaming of the moscow that so appealed to 
his imagination and bird restored to its native galloped to our outposts inventing on the 
way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his 
comrades what had really taken place he did not wish to relate because it seemed 
to him not worth telling he found the cossacks inquired for the regiment operating with 
detachment and by evening found his master nicholas rostóv quartered at yankóvo rostóv was just 
mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with ilyín he let lavrúshka 
have another horse and took him along with him chapter viii princess mary was not 
in moscow and out of danger as prince andrew supposed after the return of alpátych 
from smolénsk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream he ordered 
the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed and wrote a letter 
to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at bald 
hills to the last extremity and to defend it leaving to the commander in discretion 
to take measures or not for the defense of bald hills where one of oldest 
generals would be captured or killed and he announced to his household that he would 
remain at bald hills but while himself remaining he gave instructions for the departure of 
the princess and dessalles with the little prince to boguchárovo and thence to moscow princess 
mary alarmed by her feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy could not bring 
herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to 
disobey him she refused to go away and her fury broke over her in a 
terrible storm he repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her trying to convict 
her he told her she had worn him out had caused his quarrel with his 
son had harbored nasty suspicions of him making it the object of her life to 
poison his existence and he drove her from his study telling her that if she 
did not go away it was all the same to him he declared that he 
did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to dare to let 
him see her the fact that he did not as she had feared order her 
to be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see 
her cheered princess mary she knew it was a proof that in the depth of 
his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away 
the morning after little nicholas had left the old prince donned his full uniform and 
prepared to visit the commander in chief his calèche was already at the door princess 
mary saw him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders 
and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs she sat 
by the window listening to his voice which reached her from the garden suddenly several 
men came running up the avenue with frightened faces princess mary ran out to the 
porch down the flower bordered path and into the avenue a large crowd of militiamen 
and domestics were moving toward her and in their midst several men were supporting by 
the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and decorations she 
ran up to him and in the play of the sunlight that fell in small 
round spots through the shade of the lime tree avenue could not be sure what 
change there was in his face all she could see was that his former stern 
and determined expression had altered to one of timidity and submission on seeing his daughter 
he moved his helpless lips and made a hoarse sound it was impossible to make 
out what he wanted he was lifted up carried to his study and laid on 
the very couch he had so feared of late the doctor who was fetched that 
same night bled him and said that the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his 
right side it was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at bald hills and 
next day they moved the prince to boguchárovo the doctor accompanying him by the time 
they reached boguchárovo dessalles and the little prince had already left for moscow for three 
weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new house prince andrew had 
built at boguchárovo ever in the same state getting neither better nor worse he was 
unconscious and lay like a distorted corpse he muttered unceasingly his eyebrows and lips twitching 
and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around him 
or not one thing was he was suffering and wished to say something but what 
it was no one could tell it might be some caprice of a sick and 
half crazy man or it might relate to public affairs or possibly to family concerns 
the doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to physical causes 
but princess mary thought he wished to tell her something and the fact that her 
presence always increased his restlessness confirmed her opinion he was evidently suffering both physically and 
mentally there was no hope of recovery it was impossible for him to travel it 
would not do to let him die on the road it not be better if 
the end did come the very end princess mary sometimes thought night and day hardly 
sleeping at all she watched him and terrible to say often watched him not with 
hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find symptoms of the approach of 
the end strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself yet 
there it was and what seemed still more terrible to her was that since her 
illness began perhaps even sooner when she stayed with him expecting something to happen all 
the personal desires and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened 
thoughts that had not entered her mind for of a life free from the fear 
of her father and even the possibility of love and of family continually in her 
imagination like temptations of the devil thrust them aside as she would questions continually recurred 
to her as to how she would order her life now after that these were 
temptations of the devil and princess mary knew it she knew that the sole weapon 
against him was prayer and she tried to pray she assumed an attitude of prayer 
looked at the icons repeated the words of a prayer but she could not pray 
she felt that a different world had now taken possession of life of a world 
of strenuous and free activity quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now 
she had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer she could 
not pray could not weep and worldly cares took possession of her it was becoming 
dangerous to remain in boguchárovo news of the approach of the french came from all 
sides and in one village ten miles from boguchárovo a homestead had been looted by 
french marauders the doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince the provincial marshal 
of the nobility sent an official to princess mary to persuade her to get away 
as quickly as possible and the head of the rural police having come to boguchárovo 
urged the same thing saying that the french were only some twenty five miles away 
that french proclamations were circulating in the villages and that if the princess did not 
take her father away before the fifteenth he could not answer for the consequences the 
princess decided to leave on the fifteenth the cares of preparation and giving orders for 
which everyone came to her occupied her all day she spent the night of the 
fourteenth as usual without undressing in the room next to the one where the prince 
lay several times waking up she heard his groans and muttering the creak of his 
bed and the steps of tíkhon and the doctor when they turned him over several 
times she listened at the door and it seemed to her that his mutterings were 
louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener she could not sleep and 
several times went to the door and listened wishing to enter but not deciding to 
do so though he did not speak princess mary saw and knew how unpleasant every 
sign of anxiety on his account was to him she had noticed with what dissatisfaction 
he turned from the look she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him she knew that her 
going in during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him but never had 
she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing him she recalled 
all her life with him and in every word and act of his found an 
expression of his love of her occasionally amid these memories temptations of the devil would 
surge into her imagination thoughts of how things would be after his death and how 
her new liberated life would be ordered but she drove these thoughts away with disgust 
toward morning he became quiet and she fell asleep she woke late that sincerity which 
often comes with waking showed her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her illness on 
waking she listened to what was going on behind the door and hearing him groan 
said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same what could have 
happened what did i want i want his death she cried with a feeling of 
loathing for herself she washed dressed said her prayers and went out to the porch 
in front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed into the 
vehicles it was a warm gray morning princess mary stopped at the porch still horrified 
by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts before going to her father 
the doctor came downstairs and went out to her is a little better today said 
he was looking for you one can make out something of what he is saying 
his head is clearer come in he is asking for you princess heart beat so 
violently at this news that she grew pale and leaned against the wall to keep 
from falling to see him talk to him feel his eyes on her now that 
her whole soul was overflowing with those dreadful wicked temptations was a torment of joy 
and terror said the doctor princess mary entered her room and went up to his 
bed he was lying on his back propped up high and his small bony hands 
with their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt his left eye gazed straight 
before him his right eye was awry and his brows and lips motionless he seemed 
altogether so thin small and pathetic his face seemed to have shriveled or melted his 
features had grown smaller princess mary went up and kissed his hand his left hand 
pressed hers so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to 
come he twitched her hand and his brows and lips quivered angrily she looked at 
him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her when she changed her 
position so that his left eye could see her face he calmed down not taking 
his eyes off her for some seconds then his lips and tongue moved sounds came 
and he began to speak gazing timidly and imploringly at her evidently afraid that she 
might not understand straining all her faculties princess mary looked at him the comic efforts 
with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with difficulty repress 
the sobs that rose to her throat he said something repeating the same words several 
times she could not understand them but tried to guess what he was saying and 
inquiringly repeated the words he uttered ar ate ate he repeated several times it was 
quite impossible to understand these sounds the doctor thought he had guessed them and inquiringly 
repeated are you afraid the prince shook his head again repeated the same sounds mind 
my mind aches questioned princess mary he made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this 
took her hand and began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if 
trying to find the right place for it thoughts about you thoughts he then uttered 
much more clearly than he had done before now that he was sure of being 
understood princess mary pressed her head against his hand trying to hide her sobs and 
tears he moved his hand over her hair have been calling you all night he 
brought out only i had known she said through her tears was afraid to come 
in he pressed her hand you asleep i did not sleep said princess mary shaking 
her head unconsciously imitating her father she now tried to express herself as he did 
as much as possible by signs and her tongue too seemed to move with difficulty 
one dearest princess mary could not quite make out what he had said but from 
his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as 
he had never used to her before you come in i was wishing for his 
death thought princess mary he was silent awhile you daughter dear for all for all 
forgive thank you forgive thank you and tears began to flow from his eyes andrew 
he said suddenly and a childish timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face 
as he spoke he himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless so at least 
it seemed to princess mary have a letter from him she replied he glanced at 
her with timid surprise is he with the army father at smolénsk he closed his 
eyes and remained silent a long time then as if in answer to his doubts 
and to confirm the fact that now he understood and remembered everything he nodded his 
head and reopened his eyes he said softly and distinctly has perished destroyed her and 
he began to sob and again tears flowed from his eyes princess mary could no 
longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face again he closed his 
eyes his sobs ceased he pointed to his eyes and tíkhon understanding him wiped away 
the tears then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could 
understand for a long time till at last tíkhon understood and repeated it princess mary 
had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in which he had just 
been speaking she thought he was speaking of russia or prince andrew of herself of 
his grandson or of his own death and so she could not guess his words 
on your white dress i like it was what he said having understood this princess 
mary sobbed still louder and the doctor taking her arm led her out to the 
veranda soothing her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey when she 
had left the room the prince again began speaking about his son about the war 
and about the emperor angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice and then 
he had a second and final stroke princess mary stayed on the veranda the day 
had cleared it was hot and sunny she could understand nothing think of nothing and 
feel nothing except passionate love for her father love such as she thought she had 
never felt till that moment she ran out sobbing into the garden and as far 
as the pond along the avenues of young lime trees prince andrew had planted i 
i i wished for his death yes i wanted it to end quicker i wished 
to be at peace and what will become of me what use will peace be 
when he is no longer here princess mary murmured pacing the garden with hurried steps 
and pressing her hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs when she had 
completed the tour of the garden which brought her again to the house she saw 
mademoiselle had remained at boguchárovo and did not wish to leave toward her with a 
stranger this was the marshal of the nobility of the district who had come personally 
to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt departure princess mary listened 
without understanding him she led him to the house offered him lunch and sat down 
with him then excusing herself she went to the door of the old room the 
doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter away princess 
go away go away she returned to the garden and sat down on the grass 
at the foot of the slope by the pond where no one could see her 
she did not know how long she had been there when she was aroused by 
the sound of a footsteps running along the path she rose and saw dunyásha her 
maid who was evidently looking for her and who stopped suddenly as if in alarm 
on seeing her mistress come princess the prince said dunyásha in a breaking voice coming 
coming replied the princess hurriedly not giving dunyásha time to finish what she was saying 
and trying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house will you must 
be prepared for everything said the marshal meeting her at the house door me alone 
not true she cried angrily to him the doctor tried to stop her she pushed 
him aside and ran to her door are these people with frightened faces stopping me 
i want any of them and what are they doing here she thought she opened 
the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened room startled her in the 
room were her nurse and other women they all drew back from the bed making 
way for her he was still lying on the bed as before but the stern 
expression of his quiet face made princess mary stop short on the threshold not impossible 
she told herself and approached him and repressing the terror that seized her she pressed 
her lips to his cheek but she stepped back immediately all the force of the 
tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was replaced by a feeling 
of horror at what lay there before her he is no more he is not 
but here where he was is something unfamiliar and hostile some dreadful terrifying and repellent 
mystery and hiding her face in her hands princess mary sank into the arms of 
the doctor who held her up in the presence of tíkhon and the doctor the 
women washed what had been the prince tied his head up with a handkerchief that 
the mouth should not stiffen while open and with another handkerchief tied together the legs 
that were already spreading apart then they dressed him in uniform with his decorations and 
placed his shriveled little body on a table heaven only knows who arranged all this 
and when but it all got done as if of its own accord toward night 
candles were burning round his coffin a pall was spread over it the floor was 
strewn with sprays of juniper a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head 
and in a corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms just as 
horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse so the inmates of the 
house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round the marshal the village elder peasant 
all with fixed and frightened eyes crossing themselves bowed and kissed the old cold and 
stiffened hand chapter ix until prince andrew settled in boguchárovo its owners had always been 
absentees and its peasants were of quite a different character from those of bald hills 
they differed from them in speech dress and disposition they were called steppe peasants the 
old prince used to approve of them for their endurance at work when they came 
to bald hills to help with the harvest or to dig ponds and ditches but 
he disliked them for their boorishness prince last stay at boguchárovo when he introduced hospitals 
and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay had not softened their 
disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them the traits of character the old 
prince called boorishness various obscure rumors were always current among them at one time a 
rumor that they would all be enrolled as cossacks at another of a new religion 
to which they were all to be converted then of some proclamation of the and 
of an oath to the tsar paul in 1797 in connection with which it was 
rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it then of 
peter return to the throne in seven time when everything would be made free and 
so that there would be no restrictions rumors of the war with bonaparte and his 
invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of antichrist 
the end of the world and freedom in the vicinity of boguchárovo were large villages 
belonging to the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where 
they pleased there were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and also very few 
domestic or literate serfs and in the lives of the peasantry of those parts the 
mysterious undercurrents in the life of the russian people the causes and meaning of which 
are so baffling to contemporaries were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among others one 
instance which had occurred some twenty years before was a movement among the peasants to 
emigrate to some unknown rivers hundreds of peasants among them the boguchárovo folk suddenly began 
selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast as birds migrate to 
somewhere beyond the sea so these men with their wives and children streamed to the 
southeast to parts where none of them had ever been they set off in caravans 
bought their freedom one by one or ran away and drove or walked toward the 
rivers many of them were punished some sent to siberia many died of cold and 
hunger on the road many returned of their own accord and the movement died down 
of itself just as it had sprung up without apparent reason but such undercurrents still 
existed among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely 
unexpectedly and at the same time simply naturally and forcibly now in 1812 to anyone 
living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents were acting 
strongly and nearing an eruption alpátych who had reached boguchárovo shortly before the old death 
noticed an agitation among the peasants and that contrary to what was happening in the 
bald hills district where over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving 
away and leaving their villages to be devastated by the cossacks the peasants in the 
steppe region round boguchárovo were it was rumored in touch with the french received leaflets 
from them that passed from hand to hand and did not migrate he learned from 
domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant karp who possessed great influence in the 
village commune and had recently been away driving a government transport had returned with news 
that the cossacks were destroying deserted villages but that the french did not harm them 
alpátych also knew that on the previous day another peasant had even brought from the 
village of visloúkhovo which was occupied by the french a proclamation by a french general 
that no harm would be done to the inhabitants and if they remained they would 
be paid for anything taken from them as proof of this the peasant had brought 
from visloúkhovo a hundred rubles in notes he did not know that they were false 
paid to him in advance for hay more important still alpátych learned that on the 
morning of the very day he gave the village elder orders to collect carts to 
move the luggage from boguchárovo there had been a village meeting at which it had 
been decided not to move but to wait yet there was no time to waste 
on the fifteenth the day of the old death the marshal had insisted on princess 
leaving at once as it was becoming dangerous he had told her that after the 
sixteenth he could not be responsible for what might happen on the evening of the 
day the old prince died the marshal went away promising to return next day for 
the funeral but this he was unable to do for he received tidings that the 
french had unexpectedly advanced and had barely time to remove his own family and valuables 
from his estate for some thirty years boguchárovo had been managed by the village elder 
dron whom the old prince called by the diminutive dron was one of those physically 
and mentally vigorous peasants who grow big beards as soon as they are of age 
and go on unchanged till they are sixty or seventy without a gray hair or 
the loss of a tooth as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty soon 
after the migration to the rivers in which he had taken part like the rest 
dron was made village elder and overseer of boguchárovo and had since filled that post 
irreproachably for twenty three years the peasants feared him more than they did their master 
the masters both the old prince and the young and the steward respected him and 
jestingly called him minister during the whole time of his service dron had never been 
drunk or ill never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the 
least fatigue and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money 
account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless cartloads he 
sold for the prince nor a single shock of the whole corn crop on any 
single acre of the boguchárovo fields alpátych arriving from the devastated bald hills estate sent 
for his dron on the day of the funeral and told him to have twelve 
horses got ready for the carriages and eighteen carts for the things to be removed 
from boguchárovo though the peasants paid quitrent alpátych thought no difficulty would be made about 
complying with this order for there were two hundred and thirty households at work in 
boguchárovo and the peasants were well to do but on hearing the order dron lowered 
his eyes and remained silent alpátych named certain peasants he knew from whom he told 
him to take the carts dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away 
carting alpátych named others but they too according to dron had no horses available some 
horses were carting for the government others were too weak and others had died for 
want of fodder it seemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages 
much less for the carting alpátych looked intently at dron and frowned just as dron 
was a model village elder so alpátych had not managed the estates for twenty years 
in vain he was a model steward possessing in the highest degree the faculty of 
divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt with having glanced at dron he 
at once understood that his answers did not express his personal views but the general 
mood of the boguchárovo commune by which the elder had already been carried away but 
he also knew that dron who had acquired property and was hated by the commune 
must be hesitating between the two camps the and the he noticed this hesitation in 
look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him just listen drónushka said he 
talk nonsense to me his excellency prince andrew himself gave me orders to move all 
the people away and not leave them with the enemy and there is an order 
from the tsar about it too anyone who stays is a traitor to the tsar 
do you hear hear dron answered without lifting his eyes alpátych was not satisfied with 
this reply dron it will turn out badly he said shaking his head power is 
in your hands dron rejoined sadly dron drop it alpátych repeated withdrawing his hand from 
his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at feet can see through you and 
three yards into the ground under you he continued gazing at the floor in front 
of dron dron was disconcerted glanced furtively at alpátych and again lowered his eyes drop 
this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their homes and go 
to moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for the things and go 
to any meeting yourself do you hear dron suddenly fell on his knees alpátych discharge 
me take the keys from me and discharge me for sake that cried alpátych sternly 
see through you and three yards under you he repeated knowing that his skill in 
beekeeping his knowledge of the right time to sow the oats and the fact that 
he had been able to retain the old favor for twenty years had long since 
gained him the reputation of being a wizard and that the power of seeing three 
yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards dron got up and was 
about to say something but alpátych interrupted him is it you have got into your 
heads eh what are you thinking of eh am i to do with the people 
said dron quite beside themselves i have already told them them i dare say said 
alpátych they drinking he asked abruptly beside themselves yákov alpátych fetched another barrel then listen 
go to the police officer and you tell them so and that they must stop 
this and the carts must be got ready understand alpátych did not insist further he 
had managed people for a long time and knew that the chief way to make 
them obey is to show no suspicion that they can possibly disobey having wrung a 
submissive from dron alpátych contented himself with that though he not only doubted but felt 
almost certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be forthcoming and 
so it was for when evening came no carts had been provided in the village 
outside the drink shop another meeting was being held which decided that the horses should 
be driven out into the woods and the carts should not be provided without saying 
anything of this to the princess alpátych had his own belongings taken out of the 
carts which had arrived from bald hills and had those horses got ready for the 
carriages meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities chapter x after her funeral princess 
mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone a maid came 
to the door to say that alpátych was asking for orders about their departure this 
was before his talk with dron princess mary raised herself on the sofa on which 
she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean 
to go away and begged to be left in peace the windows of the room 
in which she was lying looked westward she lay on the sofa with her face 
to the wall fingering the buttons of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that 
cushion and her confused thoughts were centered on one irrevocability of death and her own 
spiritual baseness which she had not suspected but which had shown itself during her illness 
she wished to pray but did not dare to dared not in her present state 
of mind address herself to god she lay for a long time in that position 
the sun had reached the other side of the house and its slanting rays shone 
into the open window lighting up the room and part of the morocco cushion at 
which princess mary was looking the flow of her thoughts suddenly stopped unconsciously she sat 
up smoothed her hair got up and went to the window involuntarily inhaling the freshness 
of the clear but windy evening you can well enjoy the evening now he is 
gone and no one will hinder you she said to herself and sinking into a 
chair she let her head fall on the window sill someone spoke her name in 
a soft and tender voice from the garden and kissed her head she looked up 
it was mademoiselle bourienne in a black dress and weepers she softly approached princess mary 
sighed kissed her and immediately began to cry the princess looked up at her all 
their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind but she remembered too 
how he had changed of late toward mademoiselle bourienne and could not bear to see 
her thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches princess mary had mentally addressed to her 
is it for me for me who desired his death to condemn anyone she thought 
princess mary vividly pictured to herself the position of mademoiselle bourienne whom she had of 
late kept at a distance but who yet was dependent on her and living in 
her house she felt sorry for her and held out her hand with a glance 
of gentle inquiry mademoiselle bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand speaking 
of the sorrow and making herself a partner in it she said her only consolation 
was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow that all the 
old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief that she felt herself blameless 
in regard to everyone and that he from above saw her affection and gratitude the 
princess heard her not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening 
to the sound of her voice position is doubly terrible dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne 
after a pause understand that you could not and cannot think of yourself but with 
my love for you i must do so has alpátych been to you has he 
spoken to you of going away she asked princess mary did not answer she did 
not understand who was to go or where to it possible to plan or think 
of anything now is it not all the same she thought and did not reply 
know chère marie said mademoiselle bourienne we are in surrounded by the french it would 
be dangerous to move now if we go we are almost sure to be taken 
prisoners and god knows princess mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was 
talking about if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now she said course 
i would on no account wish to go away from him alpátych did say something 
about going speak to him i can do nothing nothing and want to spoken to 
him he hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow but i think 
it would now be better to stay here said mademoiselle bourienne you will agree chère 
marie to fall into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be 
terrible mademoiselle bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation not printed on ordinary russian paper 
of general telling people not to leave their homes and that the french authorities would 
afford them proper protection she handed this to the princess think it would be best 
to appeal to that general she continued i am sure that all due respect would 
be shown you princess mary read the paper and her face began to quiver with 
stifled sobs whom did you get this she asked probably recognized that i am french 
by my name replied mademoiselle bourienne blushing princess mary with the paper in her hand 
rose from the window and with a pale face went out of the room and 
into what had been prince study send alpátych or drónushka or somebody to me she 
said tell mademoiselle bourienne not to come to me she added hearing mademoiselle voice must 
go at once at once she said appalled at the thought of being left in 
the hands of the french prince andrew heard that i was in the power of 
the french that i the daughter of prince nicholas bolkónski asked general rameau for protection 
and accepted his favor this idea horrified her made her shudder blush and feel such 
a rush of anger and pride as she had never experienced before all that was 
distressing and especially all that was humiliating in her position rose vividly to her mind 
the french would settle in this house m le général rameau would occupy prince study 
and amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers mademoiselle bourienne would 
do the honors of boguchárovo for him i should be given a small room as 
a favor the soldiers would violate my newly dug grave to steal his crosses and 
stars they would tell me of their victories over the russians and would pretend to 
sympathize with my sorrow thought princess mary not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound 
to think like her father and her brother for herself she did not care where 
she remained or what happened to her but she felt herself the representative of her 
dead father and of prince andrew involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings 
what they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to 
say and do she went into prince study trying to enter completely into his ideas 
and considered her position the demands of life which had seemed to her annihilated by 
her death all at once rose before her with a new previously unknown force and 
took possession of her agitated and flushed she paced the room sending now for michael 
ivánovich and now for tíkhon or dron dunyásha the nurse and the other maids could 
not say in how far mademoiselle statement was correct alpátych was not at home he 
had gone to the police neither could the architect michael ivánovich who on being sent 
for came in with sleepy eyes tell princess mary anything with just the same smile 
of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old 
prince without expressing views of his own he now replied to princess mary so that 
nothing definite could be got from his answers the old valet tíkhon with sunken emaciated 
face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief replied to all princess questions and hardly 
refrained from sobbing as he looked at her at length dron the village elder entered 
the room and with a deep bow to princess mary came to a halt by 
the doorpost princess mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of 
him she said regarding as a sure friend this drónushka who always used to bring 
a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the fair at vyázma every year 
and smilingly offer it to her now since our misfortune she began but could not 
go on are all in hands said he with a sigh they were silent for 
a while alpátych has gone off somewhere and i have no one to turn to 
is it true as they tell me that i even go away you go away 
your excellency you can go said dron was told it would be dangerous because of 
the enemy dear friend i can do nothing i understand nothing i have nobody i 
want to go away tonight or early tomorrow morning dron paused he looked askance at 
princess mary and said are no horses i told yákov alpátych so are there none 
asked the princess all scourge said dron horses we had have been taken for the 
army or have is such a year not a case of feeding may die of 
hunger ourselves as it is some go three days without eating nothing been ruined princess 
mary listened attentively to what he told her peasants are ruined they have no bread 
she asked dying of hunger said dron not a case of carting why you tell 
me drónushka it possible to help them do all i can to princess mary it 
was strange that now at a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul there 
could be rich people and poor and the rich could refrain from helping the poor 
she had heard vaguely that there was such a thing as which was sometimes given 
to the peasants she also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse 
to help the peasants in need she only feared to make some mistake in speaking 
about the distribution of the grain she wished to give she was glad such cares 
presented themselves enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief she began asking dron 
about the needs and what there was in boguchárovo that belonged to the landlord we 
have grain belonging to my brother she said grain is all safe replied dron proudly 
prince did not order it to be sold it to the peasants let them have 
all they need i give you leave in my name said she dron made no 
answer but sighed deeply them that corn if there is enough of it distribute it 
all i give this order in my name and tell them that what is ours 
is theirs we do not grudge them anything tell them so dron looked intently at 
the princess while she was speaking me little mother for sake order the keys to 
be taken from me said he have served twenty three years and have done no 
wrong discharge me for sake princess mary did not understand what he wanted of her 
or why he was asking to be discharged she replied that she had never doubted 
his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the 
peasants chapter xi an hour later dunyásha came to tell the princess that dron had 
come and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the order and wished 
to have word with their mistress i never told them to come said princess mary 
only told dron to let them have the grain for sake princess dear have them 
sent away and go out to them all a trick said dunyásha when yákov alpátych 
returns let us get away and please is a trick asked princess mary in surprise 
know it is only listen to me for sake ask nurse too they say they 
agree to leave boguchárovo as you ordered making some mistake i never ordered them to 
go away said princess mary drónushka dron came and confirmed words the peasants had come 
by the order i never sent for them declared the princess must have given my 
message wrong i only said that you were to give them the grain dron only 
sighed in reply you order it they will go away said he no go out 
to them said princess mary and in spite of the and protests she went out 
into the porch dron dunyásha the nurse and michael ivánovich following her probably think i 
am offering them the grain to bribe them to remain here while i myself go 
away leaving them to the mercy of the french thought princess mary will offer them 
monthly rations and housing at our moscow estate i am sure andrew would do even 
more in my place she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the 
crowd standing on the pasture by the barn the men crowded closer together stirred and 
rapidly took off their hats princess mary lowered her eyes and tripping over her skirt 
came close up to them so many different eyes old and young were fixed on 
her and there were so many different faces that she could not distinguish any of 
them and feeling that she must speak to them all at once did not know 
how to do it but again the sense that she represented her father and her 
brother gave her courage and she boldly began her speech am very glad you have 
come she said without raising her eyes and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently 
tells me that the war has ruined you that is our common misfortune and i 
shall grudge nothing to help you i am myself going away because it is dangerous 
here the enemy is near because i am giving you everything my friends and i 
beg you to take everything all our grain so that you may not suffer want 
and if you have been told that i am giving you the grain to keep 
you is not true on the contrary i ask you to go with all your 
belongings to our estate near moscow and i promise you i will see to it 
that there you shall want for nothing you shall be given food and lodging the 
princess stopped sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd am not doing this 
on my own account she continued do it in the name of my dead father 
who was a good master to you and of my brother and his son again 
she paused no one broke the silence is a common misfortune and we will share 
it together all that is mine is yours she concluded scanning the faces before her 
all eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression she could not 
fathom whether it was curiosity devotion gratitude or apprehension and the expression on all the 
faces was identical are all very thankful for your bounty but it do for us 
to take the grain said a voice at the back of the crowd why not 
asked the princess no one replied and princess mary looking round at the crowd found 
that every eye she met now was immediately dropped why you want to take it 
she asked again no one answered the silence began to oppress the princess and she 
tried to catch eye you speak she inquired of a very old man who stood 
just in front of her leaning on his stick you think something more is wanted 
tell me i will do anything said she catching his eye but as if this 
angered him he bent his head quite low and muttered should we agree we want 
the grain should we give up everything we agree agree we are sorry for you 
but not willing go away yourself alone came from various sides of the crowd and 
again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression though now it was 
certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude but of angry resolve you have understood 
me said princess mary with a sad smile you want to go i promise to 
house and feed you while here the enemy would ruin you but her voice was 
drowned by the voices of the crowd not willing let them ruin us we take 
your grain we agree again princess mary tried to catch eye but not a single 
eye in the crowd was turned to her evidently they were all trying to avoid 
her look she felt strange and awkward yes an artful tale follow her into slavery 
pull down your houses and go into bondage i dare say give you grain indeed 
she says voices in the crowd were heard saying with drooping head princess mary left 
the crowd and went back to the house having repeated her order to dron to 
have horses ready for her departure next morning she went to her room and remained 
alone with her own thoughts chapter xii for a long time that night princess mary 
sat by the open window of her room hearing the sound of the voices that 
reached her from the village but it was not of them she was thinking she 
felt that she could not understand them however much she might think about them she 
thought only of one thing her sorrow which after the break caused by cares for 
the present seemed already to belong to the past now she could remember it and 
weep or pray after sunset the wind had dropped the night was calm and fresh 
toward midnight the voices began to subside a cock crowed the full moon began to 
show from behind the lime trees a fresh white dewy mist began to rise and 
stillness reigned over the village and the house pictures of the near illness and last 
one after another to her memory with mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images 
repelling with horror only the last one the picture of his death which she felt 
she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night 
and these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they 
seemed now present now past and now future she vividly recalled the moment when he 
had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden 
at bald hills muttering something with his helpless tongue twitching his gray eyebrows and looking 
uneasily and timidly at her then he wanted to tell me what he told me 
the day he died she thought had always thought what he said then and she 
recalled in all its detail the night at bald hills before he had the last 
stroke when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will 
she had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe and going to the door 
of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the door in a 
suffering and weary voice he was saying something to tíkhon speaking of the crimea and 
its warm nights and of the empress evidently he had wanted to talk why he 
call me why he let me be there instead of tíkhon princess mary had thought 
and thought again now he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul 
never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have said 
all he longed to say and not tíkhon but i might have heard and understood 
him why i enter the room she thought he would then have said to me 
what he said the day he died while talking to tíkhon he asked about me 
twice he wanted to see me and i was standing close by outside the door 
it was sad and painful for him to talk to tíkhon who did not understand 
him i remember how he began speaking to him about lise as if she were 
had forgotten she was tíkhon reminded him that she was no more and he shouted 
he was greatly depressed from behind the door i heard how he lay down on 
his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed god why i go in then what could he 
have done to me what could i have lost and perhaps he would then have 
been comforted and would have said that word to me and princess mary uttered aloud 
the caressing word he had said to her on the day of his death est 
she repeated and began sobbing with tears that relieved her soul she now saw his 
face before her and not the face she had known ever since she could remember 
and had always seen at a distance but the timid feeble face she had seen 
for the first time quite closely with all its wrinkles and details when she stooped 
near to his mouth to catch what he said est she repeated again was he 
thinking when he uttered that word what is he thinking now this question suddenly presented 
itself to her and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that 
was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up 
with a white handkerchief and the horror that had seized her when she touched him 
and convinced herself that that was not he but something mysterious and horrible seized her 
again she tried to think of something else and to pray but could do neither 
with wide open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows expecting every moment 
to see his dead face and she felt that the silence brooding over the house 
and within it held her fast she whispered she screamed wildly and tearing herself out 
of this silence she ran to the quarters to meet her old nurse and the 
maidservants who came running toward her chapter xiii on the seventeenth of august rostóv and 
ilyín accompanied by lavrúshka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly 
left their quarters at yankóvo ten miles from boguchárovo and went for a try a 
new horse ilyín had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to 
be had in the villages for the last three days boguchárovo had lain between the 
two hostile armies so that it was as easy for the russian rearguard to get 
to it as for the french vanguard rostóv as a careful squadron commander wished to 
take such provisions as remained at boguchárovo before the french could get them rostóv and 
ilyín were in the merriest of moods on the way to boguchárovo a princely estate 
with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and 
pretty girls they questioned lavrúshka about napoleon and laughed at his stories and raced one 
another to try horse rostóv had no idea that the village he was entering was 
the property of that very bolkónski who had been engaged to his sister rostóv and 
ilyín gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching 
boguchárovo and rostóv outstripping ilyín was the first to gallop into the village street first 
cried ilyín flushed always first both on the grassland and here answered rostóv stroking his 
heated donéts horse have won on my frenchy your excellency said lavrúshka from behind alluding 
to his shabby cart horse i wish to mortify you they rode at a footpace 
to the barn where a large crowd of peasants was standing some of the men 
bared their heads others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps two tall 
old peasants with wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern smiling staggering and 
singing some incoherent song and approached the officers fellows said rostóv laughing there any hay 
here how like one another said ilyín mo o st me r r y co 
o m pa sang one of the peasants with a blissful smile one of the 
men came out of the crowd and went up to rostóv do you belong to 
he asked french replied ilyín jestingly here is napoleon he pointed to lavrúshka you are 
russians the peasant asked again is there a large force of you here said another 
a short man coming up large answered rostóv why have you collected here he added 
it a holiday old men have met to talk over the business of the commune 
replied the peasant moving away at that moment on the road leading from the big 
house two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the 
officers one in pink is mine so keep off said ilyín on seeing dunyásha running 
resolutely toward him be ours said lavrúshka to ilyín winking do you want my pretty 
said ilyín with a smile princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name 
is count rostóv squadron commander and i am your humble servant o om pa ny 
roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he looked at ilyín talking to 
the girl following dunyásha alpátych advanced to rostóv having bared his head while still at 
a distance i make bold to trouble your honor said he respectfully but with a 
shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust into 
his bosom mistress daughter of general in chief prince nicholas bolkónski who died on the 
fifteenth of this month finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these pointed 
to the you to come up to the house you please ride on a little 
farther said alpátych with a melancholy smile it is not convenient in the presence of 
he pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to 
a horse alpátych ah yákov alpátych grand forgive us for sake eh said the peasants 
smiling joyfully at him rostóv looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled perhaps they amuse 
your honor remarked alpátych with a staid air as he pointed at the old men 
with his free hand not much to be amused at here said rostóv and rode 
on a little way the matter he asked make bold to inform your honor that 
the rude peasants here wish to let the mistress leave the estate and threaten to 
unharness her horses so that though everything has been packed up since morning her excellency 
cannot get away exclaimed rostóv have the honor to report to you the actual truth 
said alpátych rostóv dismounted gave his horse to the orderly and followed alpátych to the 
house questioning him as to the state of affairs it appeared that the offer of 
corn to the peasants the previous day and her talk with dron and at the 
meeting had actually had so bad an effect that dron had finally given up the 
keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when alpátych sent for him and 
that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey the 
peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they 
would not let her leave the village that there was an order not to move 
and that they would unharness the horses alpátych had gone out to admonish them but 
was told it was chiefly karp who did the talking dron not showing himself in 
the crowd that they could not let the princess go that there was an order 
to the contrary but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and 
obey her in everything at the moment when rostóv and ilyín were galloping along the 
road princess mary despite the dissuasions of alpátych her nurse and the maids had given 
orders to harness and intended to start but when the cavalrymen were espied they were 
taken for frenchmen the coachman ran away and the women in the house began to 
wail benefactor god has sent you exclaimed deeply moved voices as rostóv passed through the 
anteroom princess mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting room when rostóv 
was shown in she could not grasp who he was and why he had come 
or what was happening to her when she saw his russian face and by his 
walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own 
class she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a 
voice that faltered and trembled with emotion this meeting immediately struck rostóv as a romantic 
event helpless girl overwhelmed with grief left to the mercy of coarse rioting peasants and 
what a strange fate sent me here what gentleness and nobility there are in her 
features and expression thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid 
story when she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after 
her funeral her voice trembled she turned away and then as if fearing he might 
take her words as meant to move him to pity looked at him with an 
apprehensive glance of inquiry there were tears in eyes princess mary noticed this and glanced 
gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to 
be forgotten cannot express princess how glad i am that i happened to ride here 
and am able to show my readiness to serve you said rostóv rising when you 
please and i give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to 
cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort and 
bowing respectfully as if to a lady of royal blood he moved toward the door 
deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted 
with her he did not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon 
her princess mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy am very very grateful to you 
she said in french i hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one 
is to blame for it she suddenly began to cry me she said rostóv knitting 
his brows left the room with another low bow chapter xiv is she pretty ah 
pink one is delicious her name is dunyásha but on glancing at face ilyín stopped 
short he saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of 
thought rostóv glanced angrily at ilyín and without replying strode off with rapid steps to 
the village show them give it to them the brigands said he to himself alpátych 
at a gliding trot only just managing not to run kept up with him with 
difficulty decision have you been pleased to come to said he rostóv stopped and clenching 
his fists suddenly and sternly turned on alpátych what decision old dotard cried he have 
you been about eh the peasants are rioting and you manage them a traitor yourself 
i know you flay you all alive and as if afraid of wasting his store 
of anger he left alpátych and went rapidly forward alpátych mastering his offended feelings kept 
pace with rostóv at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views he said 
the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to 
them without an armed force and would it not be better first to send for 
the military give them armed force them uttered rostóv meaninglessly breathless with irrational animal fury 
and the need to vent it without considering what he would do he moved unconciously 
with quick resolute steps toward the crowd and the nearer he drew to it the 
more alpátych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results the peasants in the 
crowd were similarly impressed when they saw rapid firm steps and resolute frowning face after 
the hussars had come to the village and rostóv had gone to see the princess 
a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd some of the peasants said 
that these new arrivals were russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was 
being detained dron was of this opinion but as soon as he expressed it karp 
and others attacked their ex elder many years have you been fattening on the commune 
karp shouted at him all one to you dig up your pot of money and 
take it away with you what does it matter to you whether our homes are 
ruined or not been told to keep order and that no one is to leave 
their homes or take away a single grain and all about it cried another was 
your turn to be conscripted but no fear you begrudged your lump of a son 
a little old man suddenly began attacking so they took my vánka to be shaved 
for a soldier but we all have to die be sure we all have to 
die not against the commune said dron against it filled your belly the two tall 
peasants had their say as soon as rostóv followed by ilyín lavrúshka and alpátych came 
up to the crowd karp thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little 
walked to the front dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd 
drew closer together is your elder here hey shouted rostóv coming up to the crowd 
with quick steps elder what do you want with him asked karp but before the 
words were well out of his mouth his cap flew off and a fierce blow 
jerked his head to one side off traitors shouted rostóv in a wrathful voice the 
elder he cried furiously elder he wants the elder dron zakhárych you meek and flustered 
voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come off their heads 
riot following the orders declared karp and at that moment several voices began speaking together 
as the old men have too many of you giving orders mutiny brigands traitors cried 
rostóv unmeaningly in a voice not his own gripping karp by the collar him bind 
him he shouted though there was no one to bind him but lavrúshka and alpátych 
lavrúshka however ran up to karp and seized him by the arms from behind i 
call up our men from beyond the hill he called out alpátych turned to the 
peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind karp the men 
obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts the elder demanded 
rostóv in a loud voice with a pale and frowning face dron stepped out of 
the crowd you the elder bind him lavrúshka shouted rostóv as if that order too 
could not possibly meet with any opposition and in fact two more peasants began binding 
dron who took off his own belt and handed it to them as if to 
aid them you all listen to me said rostóv to the peasants off to your 
houses at once and let one of your voices be heard not done any harm 
we did it just out of foolishness all nonsense i said then that it was 
not in order voices were heard bickering with one another what did i say said 
alpátych coming into his own again wrong lads our stupidity yákov alpátych came the answers 
and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village the two bound men 
were led off to the house the two drunken peasants followed them when i look 
at you said one of them to karp can one talk to the masters like 
that what were you thinking of you fool added the real fool two hours later 
the carts were standing in the courtyard of the boguchárovo house the peasants were briskly 
carrying out the goods and packing them on the carts and dron liberated at princess 
wish from the cupboard where he had been confined was standing in the yard directing 
the men put it in so carelessly said one of the peasants a man with 
a round smiling face taking a casket from a housemaid know it has cost money 
how can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord where 
get rubbed i like that way of doing things let it all be done properly 
according to rule look here put it under the bast matting and cover it with 
the way books books said another peasant bringing out prince library cupboards catch up against 
it heavy books they worked all day and play remarked the tall round faced peasant 
gravely pointing with a significant wink at the dictionaries that were on the top unwilling 
to obtrude himself on the princess rostóv did not go back to the house but 
remained in the village awaiting her departure when her carriage drove out of the house 
he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from boguchárovo to where the road was occupied 
by our troops at the inn at yankóvo he respectfully took leave of her for 
the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand can you speak so he blushingly 
replied to princess expressions of gratitude for her deliverance as she termed what had occurred 
police officer would have done as much if we had had only peasants to fight 
we should not have let the enemy come so far said he with a sense 
of shame and wishing to change the subject am only happy to have had the 
opportunity of making your acquaintance good by princess i wish you happiness and consolation and 
hope to meet you again in happier circumstances if you want to make me blush 
please thank me but the princess if she did not again thank him in words 
thanked him with the whole expression of her face radiant with gratitude and tenderness she 
could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for on the contrary it 
seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at 
the hands of the mutineers and of the french and that he had exposed himself 
to terrible and obvious danger to save her and even more certain was it that 
he was a man of lofty and noble soul able to understand her position and 
her sorrow his kind honest eyes with the tears rising in them when she herself 
had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss did not leave her memory 
when she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes 
filling with tears and then not for the first time the strange question presented itself 
to her did she love him on the rest of the way to moscow though 
the position was not a cheerful one dunyásha who went with her in the carriage 
more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at 
something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow supposing i do love him thought 
princess mary ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in 
love with a man who would perhaps never love her she comforted herself with the 
thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to 
blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she continued to the end of 
her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the 
first and last time in her life sometimes when she recalled his looks his sympathy 
and his words happiness did not appear impossible to her it was at those moments 
that dunyásha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window it not 
fate that brought him to boguchárovo and at that very moment thought princess mary that 
caused his sister to refuse my brother and in all this princess mary saw the 
hand of providence the impression the princess made on rostóv was a very agreeable one 
to remember her gave him pleasure and when his comrades hearing of his adventure at 
boguchárovo rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one 
of the wealthiest heiresses in russia he grew angry it made him angry just because 
the idea of marrying the gentle princess mary who was attractive to him and had 
an enormous fortune had against his will more than once entered his head for himself 
personally nicholas could not wish for a better wife by marrying her he would make 
the countess his mother happy would be able to put his affairs in order and 
would felt princess happiness but sónya and his plighted word that was why rostóv grew 
angry when he was rallied about princess bolkónskaya chapter xv on receiving command of the 
armies kutúzov remembered prince andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters 
prince andrew arrived at tsárevo zaymíshche on the very day and at the very hour 
that kutúzov was reviewing the troops for the first time he stopped in the village 
at the house in front of which stood the commander in carriage and he sat 
down on the bench at the gate awaiting his serene highness as everyone now called 
kutúzov from the field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now 
the roar of many voices shouting to the new commander in chief two orderlies a 
courier and a major domo stood near by some ten paces from prince andrew availing 
themselves of absence and of the fine weather a short swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars 
with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and glancing at prince andrew 
inquired whether his serene highness was putting up there and whether he would soon be 
back prince andrew replied that he was not on his serene staff but was himself 
a new arrival the lieutenant colonel turned to a smart orderly who with the peculiar 
contempt with which a commander in orderly speaks to officers replied his serene highness i 
expect be here soon what do you want the lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath 
his mustache at the tone dismounted gave his horse to a dispatch runner and approached 
bolkónski with a slight bow bolkónski made room for him on the bench and the 
lieutenant colonel sat down beside him also waiting for the commander in chief said he 
say he weceives evewyone thank god awful with those sausage eaters ermólov had weason to 
ask to be pwomoted to be a german now wussians will get a look in 
as it was devil only knows what was happening we kept wetweating and wetweating did 
you take part in the campaign he asked had the pleasure replied prince andrew only 
of taking part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all i held 
to mention the estate and home of my father who died of grief i belong 
to the province of smolénsk pwince bolkónski vewy glad to make your acquaintance lieutenant colonel 
denísov better known as said denísov pressing prince hand and looking into his face with 
a particularly kindly attention i heard said he sympathetically and after a short pause added 
scythian warfare all vewy not for those who get it in the neck so you 
are pwince andwew bolkónski he swayed his head pleased pwince to make your acquaintance he 
repeated again smiling sadly and he again pressed prince hand prince andrew knew denísov from 
what natásha had told him of her first suitor this memory carried him sadly and 
sweetly back to those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately but which 
still found place in his soul of late he had received so many new and 
very serious as the retreat from smolénsk his visit to bald hills and the recent 
news of his had experienced so many emotions that for a long time past those 
memories had not entered his mind and now that they did they did not act 
on him with nearly their former strength for denísov too the memories awakened by the 
name of bolkónski belonged to a distant romantic past when after supper and after singing 
he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing 
he smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love for natásha and 
passed at once to what now interested him passionately and exclusively this was a plan 
of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat he had 
proposed that plan to barclay de tolly and now wished to propose it to kutúzov 
the plan was based on the fact that the french line of operation was too 
extended and it proposed that instead of or concurrently with action on the front to 
bar the advance of the french we should attack their line of communication he began 
explaining his plan to prince andrew hold all that line impossible i will undertake to 
bweak thwough give me five hundwed men and i will bweak the line certain only 
one warfare denísov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to bolkónski in 
the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the army growing more incoherent and 
more diffused mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review 
was held sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village coming coming shouted a 
cossack standing at the gate bolkónski and denísov moved to the gate at which a 
knot of soldiers a guard of honor was standing and they saw kutúzov coming down 
the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse a huge suite of generals rode 
behind him barclay was riding almost beside him and a crowd of officers ran after 
and around them shouting his adjutants galloped into the yard before him kutúzov was impatiently 
urging on his horse which ambled smoothly under his weight and he raised his hand 
to his white horse cap with a red band and no peak nodding his head 
continually when he came up to the guard of honor a fine set of grenadiers 
mostly wearing decorations who were giving him the salute he looked at them silently and 
attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned 
to the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him suddenly his face assumed a subtle 
expression he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity with such fine fellows to 
retreat and retreat well good by general he added and rode into the yard past 
prince andrew and denísov hurrah hurrah shouted those behind him since prince andrew had last 
seen him kutúzov had grown still more corpulent flaccid and fat but the bleached eyeball 
the scar and the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same he was 
wearing the white horse cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his 
shoulder by a thin strap he sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk little 
horse whew whew he whistled just audibly as he rode into the yard his face 
expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who means to rest after 
a ceremony he drew his left foot out of the stirrup and lurching with his 
whole body and puckering his face with the effort raised it with difficulty onto the 
saddle leaned on his knee groaned and slipped down into the arms of the cossacks 
and adjutants who stood ready to assist him he pulled himself together looked round screwing 
up his eyes glanced at prince andrew and evidently not recognizing him moved with his 
waddling gait to the porch whew whew he whistled and again glanced at prince andrew 
as often occurs with old men it was only after some seconds that the impression 
produced by prince face linked itself up with remembrance of his personality how do you 
do my dear prince how do you do my dear boy come along said he 
glancing wearily round and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight he 
unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch your father received 
news of his death yesterday replied prince andrew abruptly kutúzov looked at him with eyes 
wide open with dismay and then took off his cap and crossed himself the kingdom 
of heaven be his will be done to us all he sighed deeply his whole 
chest heaving and was silent for a while loved him and respected him and sympathize 
with you with all my heart he embraced prince andrew pressing him to his fat 
breast and for some time did not let him go when he released him prince 
andrew saw that flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes he 
sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself come with me 
have a talk said he but at that moment denísov no more intimidated by his 
superiors than by the enemy came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch 
despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him kutúzov his hands 
still pressed on the seat glanced at him glumly denísov having given his name announced 
that he had to communicate to his serene highness a matter of great importance for 
their welfare kutúzov looked wearily at him and lifting his hands with a gesture of 
annoyance folded them across his stomach repeating the words our welfare well what is it 
speak denísov blushed like a girl it was strange to see the color rise in 
that shaggy bibulous time worn face and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting 
the lines of communication between smolénsk and vyázma denísov came from those parts and knew 
the country well his plan seemed decidedly a good one especially from the strength of 
conviction with which he spoke kutúzov looked down at his own legs occasionally glancing at 
the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it 
and from that hut while denísov was speaking a general with a portfolio under his 
arm really did appear said kutúzov in the midst of explanations you ready so soon 
your serene highness replied the general kutúzov swayed his head as much as to say 
is one man to deal with it all and again listened to denísov give my 
word of honor as a wussian officer said denísov i can bweak line of communication 
relation are you to intendant general kiríl andréevich denísov asked kutúzov interrupting him is my 
uncle your sewene highness we were friends said kutúzov cheerfully right all right friend stay 
here at the staff and tomorrow have a talk with a nod to denísov he 
turned away and put out his hand for the papers konovnítsyn had brought him not 
your serene highness like to come inside said the general on duty in a discontented 
voice plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed an adjutant came 
out and announced that everything was in readiness within but kutúzov evidently did not wish 
to enter that room till he was disengaged he made a grimace tell them to 
bring a small table out here my dear boy look at them here said he 
go away he added turning to prince andrew who remained in the porch and listened 
to the report while this was being given prince andrew heard the whisper of a 
voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door several times on glancing 
that way he noticed behind that door a plump rosy handsome woman in a pink 
dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head holding a dish and evidently awaiting 
the entrance of the commander in chief adjutant whispered to prince andrew that this was 
the wife of the priest whose home it was and that she intended to offer 
his serene highness bread and salt husband has welcomed his serene highness with the cross 
at the church and she intends to welcome him in the house very pretty added 
the adjutant with a smile at those words kutúzov looked round he was listening to 
the consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at tsárevo he had listened to 
denísov and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the austerlitz council of 
war he evidently listened only because he had ears which though there was a piece 
of tow in one of them could not help hearing but it was evident that 
nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him that he knew all 
that would be said beforehand and heard it all only because he had to as 
one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer all that denísov 
had said was clever and to the point what the general was saying was even 
more clever and to the point but it was evident that kutúzov despised knowledge and 
cleverness and knew of something else that would decide the independent of cleverness and knowledge 
prince andrew watched the commander in face attentively and the only expression he could see 
there was one of boredom curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind 
the door and a desire to observe propriety it was evident that kutúzov despised cleverness 
and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by denísov but despised them not because 
of his own intellect feelings or did not try to display any of because of 
something else he despised them because of his old age and experience of life the 
only instruction kutúzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by 
the russian troops at the end of the report the general put before him for 
signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats 
mown down by the soldiers when landowners lodged petitions for compensation after hearing the matter 
kutúzov smacked his lips together and shook his head the stove into the fire with 
it i tell you once for all my dear fellow said he the fire with 
all such things let them cut the crops and burn wood to their content i 
order it or allow it but i exact compensation either one get on without it 
wood is chopped the chips will fly he looked at the paper again this german 
precision he muttered shaking his head chapter xvi all said kutúzov as he signed the 
last of the documents and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat 
white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression the wife flushing 
rosy red caught up the dish she had after all not managed to present at 
the right moment though she had so long been preparing for it and with a 
low bow offered it to kutúzov he screwed up his eyes smiled lifted her chin 
with his hand and said what a beauty thank you sweetheart he took some gold 
pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the dish for her my dear 
and how are we getting on he asked moving to the door of the room 
assigned to him the wife smiled and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him 
into the room the adjutant came out to the porch and asked prince andrew to 
lunch with him half an hour later prince andrew was again called to kutúzov he 
found him reclining in an armchair still in the same unbuttoned overcoat he had in 
his hand a french book which he closed as prince andrew entered marking the place 
with a knife prince andrew saw by the cover that it was les chevaliers du 
cygne by madame de genlis sit down sit down here have a talk said kutúzov 
sad very sad but remember my dear fellow that i am a father to you 
a second father prince andrew told kutúzov all he knew of his death and what 
he had seen at bald hills when he passed through it what they have brought 
us to kutúzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice evidently picturing vividly to himself from 
prince story the condition russia was in give me time give me time he said 
with a grim look evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation and added sent 
for you to keep you with me thank your serene highness but i fear i 
am no longer fit for the staff replied prince andrew with a smile which kutúzov 
noticed kutúzov glanced inquiringly at him above all added prince andrew have grown used to 
my regiment am fond of the officers and i fancy the men also like me 
i should be sorry to leave the regiment if i decline the honor of being 
with you believe me a shrewd kindly yet subtly derisive expression lit up podgy face 
he cut bolkónski short am sorry for i need you but right right not here 
that men are needed advisers are always plentiful but men are not the regiments would 
not be what they are if the would be advisers served there as you do 
i remember you at austerlitz i remember yes i remember you with the standard said 
kutúzov and a flush of pleasure suffused prince face at this recollection taking his hand 
and drawing him downwards kutúzov offered his cheek to be kissed and again prince andrew 
noticed tears in the old eyes though prince andrew knew that tears came easily and 
that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show 
sympathy with his loss yet this reminder of austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to 
him your way and god be with you i know your path is the path 
of honor he paused missed you at bucharest but i needed someone to send and 
changing the subject kutúzov began to speak of the turkish war and the peace that 
had been concluded i have been much blamed he said for that war and the 
peace but everything came at the right time tout vient à point à celui qui 
sait attendre and there were as many advisers there as here he went on returning 
to the subject of which evidently occupied him those advisers said he we had listened 
to them all we should not have made peace with turkey and should not have 
been through with that war everything in haste but more haste less speed kámenski would 
have been lost if he had not died he stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men 
it is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a 
campaign for that not storming and attacking but patience and time are wanted kámenski sent 
soldiers to rustchuk but i only employed these two things and took more fortresses than 
kámenski and made them turks eat horseflesh he swayed his head the french shall too 
believe me he went on growing warmer and beating his chest make them eat horseflesh 
and tears again dimmed his eyes comes in time to him who knows how to 
wait we have to accept battle remarked prince andrew shall if everybody wants it it 
be helped but believe me my dear boy there is nothing stronger than those two 
patience and time they will do it all but the advisers pas de cette oreille 
voilà le mal some want a one to do he asked evidently expecting an answer 
what do you want us to do he repeated and his eye shone with a 
deep shrewd look tell you what to do he continued as prince andrew still did 
not reply will tell you what to do and what i do dans le doute 
mon cher he paused 2 articulated the french proverb deliberately see it that way the 
trouble 2 in doubt my dear fellow do nothing good by my dear fellow remember 
that with all my heart i share your sorrow and that for you i am 
not a serene highness nor a prince nor a commander in chief but a father 
if you want anything come straight to me good by my dear boy again he 
embraced and kissed prince andrew but before the latter had left the room kutúzov gave 
a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel les chevaliers du cygne 
by madame de genlis prince andrew could not have explained how or why it was 
but after that interview with kutúzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to 
the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been 
entrusted the more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old whom 
there seemed to remain only the habit of passions and in place of an intellect 
grouping events and drawing conclusions only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of more 
reassured he was that everything would be as it should will not bring in any 
plan of his own he will not devise or undertake anything thought prince andrew he 
will hear everything remember everything and put everything in its place he will not hinder 
anything useful nor allow anything harmful he understands that there is something stronger and more 
important than his own inevitable course of events and he can see them and grasp 
their significance and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his personal wish 
directed to something else and above all thought prince andrew believes in him because russian 
despite the novel by genlis and the french proverbs and because his voice shook when 
he said they have brought us to and had a sob in it when he 
said he would them eat horseflesh on such feelings more or less dimly shared by 
all the unanimity and general approval were founded with which despite court influences the popular 
choice of kutúzov as commander in chief was received chapter xvii after the emperor had 
left moscow life flowed on there in its usual course and its course was so 
very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and 
ardor hard to believe that russia was really in danger and that the members of 
the english club were also sons of the fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it 
the one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the stay was 
the call for contributions of men and money a necessity that as soon as the 
promises had been made assumed a legal official form and became unavoidable with the approach 
to moscow the view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the 
contrary became even more frivolous as always happens with people who see a great danger 
approaching at the approach of danger there are always two voices that speak with equal 
power in the human soul one very reasonably tells a man to consider the nature 
of the danger and the means of escaping it the other still more reasonably says 
that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger since it is 
not in power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events and it 
is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes and to think about 
what is pleasant in solitude a man generally listens to the first voice but in 
society to the second so it was now with the inhabitants of moscow it was 
long since people had been as gay in moscow as that year broadsheets headed by 
woodcuts of a drink shop a potman and a moscow burgher called karpúshka chigírin been 
a militiaman and having had rather too much at the that napoleon wished to come 
to moscow grew angry abused the french in very bad language came out of the 
drink shop and under the sign of the eagle began to address the assembled people 
were read and discussed together with the latest of vasíli lvóvich bouts rimés in the 
corner room at the club members gathered to read these broadsheets and some liked the 
way karpúshka jeered at the french saying will swell up with russian cabbage burst with 
our buckwheat porridge and choke themselves with cabbage soup they are all dwarfs and one 
peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork others did not like that 
tone and said it was stupid and vulgar it was said that rostopchín had expelled 
all frenchmen and even all foreigners from moscow and that there had been some spies 
and agents of napoleon among them but this was told chiefly to introduce witty remark 
on that occasion the foreigners were deported to nízhni by boat and rostopchín had said 
to them in french en vous mêmes entrez dans la barque et faites pas une 
barque de charon there was talk of all the government offices having been already removed 
from moscow and to this witticism was for that alone moscow ought to be grateful 
to napoleon it was said that regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles and 
that bezúkhov had spent even more on his but that the best thing about action 
was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head 
of his regiment without charging anything for the show it over get into the barque 
and take care not to make it a barque of charon spare anyone said julie 
drubetskáya as she collected and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin 
beringed fingers julie was preparing to leave moscow next day and was giving a farewell 
soiree est ridicule but he is so kind and good natured what pleasure is there 
to be so caustique forfeit cried a young man in militia uniform whom julie called 
chevalier and who was going with her to nízhni in set as in many other 
circles in moscow it had been agreed that they would speak nothing but russian and 
that those who made a slip and spoke french should pay fines to the committee 
of voluntary contributions forfeit for a gallicism said a russian writer who was present pleasure 
is there to is not russian spare no one continued julie to the young man 
without heeding the remark am guilty and will pay and i am prepared to pay 
again for the pleasure of telling you the truth for gallicisms i be responsible she 
remarked turning to the author have neither the money nor the time like prince galítsyn 
to engage a master to teach me russian here he is she added on no 
no she said to the militia officer catch me speak of the sun and you 
see its rays and she smiled amiably at pierre were just talking of you she 
said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman were saying that your 
regiment would be sure to be better than talk to me of my regiment replied 
pierre kissing his hand and taking a seat beside her am so sick of it 
will of course command it yourself said julie directing a sly sarcastic glance toward the 
militia officer the latter in presence had ceased to be caustic and his face expressed 
perplexity as to what smile might mean in spite of his absent mindedness and good 
nature personality immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face said pierre with 
a laughing glance at his big stout body should make too good a target for 
the french besides i am afraid i should hardly be able to climb onto a 
horse among those whom guests happened to choose to gossip about were the rostóvs hear 
that their affairs are in a very bad way said julie he is so unreasonable 
the count himself i mean the razumóvskis wanted to buy his house and his estate 
near moscow but it drags on and on he asks too much i think the 
sale will come off in a few days said someone it is madness to buy 
anything in moscow now asked julie think moscow is in danger why are you leaving 
what a question i am going because well because everyone is going and am not 
joan of arc or an amazon of course of course let me have some more 
strips of linen he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off 
all his debts said the militia officer speaking of rostóv kindly old man but not 
up to much and why do they stay on so long in moscow they meant 
to leave for the country long ago natalie is quite well again now she julie 
asked pierre with a knowing smile are waiting for their younger son pierre replied joined 
cossacks and went to bélaya tsérkov where the regiment is being formed but now they 
have had him transferred to my regiment and are expecting him every day the count 
wanted to leave long ago but the countess on any account leave moscow till her 
son returns met them the day before yesterday at the natalie has recovered her looks 
and is brighter she sang a song how easily some people get over everything over 
what inquired pierre looking displeased julie smiled know count such knights as you are only 
found in madame de novels knights what do you mean demanded pierre blushing come my 
dear count la fable de tout moscou je vous admire ma parole is the talk 
of all moscow my word i admire you forfeit cried the militia officer right one 
tiresome is talk of all pierre asked angrily rising to his feet now count you 
know know anything about it said pierre know you were friendly with natalie and so 
but i was always more friendly with dear véra madame pierre continued in a tone 
of displeasure have not taken on myself the role of natalie knight at all and 
have not been to their house for nearly a month but i cannot understand the 
cruelty said julie smiling and waving the lint triumphantly and to have the last word 
she promptly changed the subject you know what i heard today poor mary bolkónskaya arrived 
in moscow yesterday do you know that she has lost her father excuses himself accuses 
himself where is she i should like very much to see her said pierre spent 
the evening with her yesterday she is going to their estate near moscow either today 
or tomorrow morning with her nephew and how is she asked pierre is well but 
sad but do you know who rescued her it is quite a romance nicholas rostóv 
she was surrounded and they wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her 
people he rushed in and saved her romance said the militia officer this general flight 
has been arranged to get all the old maids married off catiche is one and 
princess bolkónskaya another you know i really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du 
jeune homme little bit in love with the young man forfeit forfeit how could one 
say that in russian chapter xviii when pierre returned home he was handed two of 
broadsheets that had been brought that day the first declared that the report that count 
rostopchín had forbidden people to leave moscow was false on the contrary he was glad 
that ladies and wives were leaving the city will be less panic and less gossip 
ran the broadsheet i will stake my life on it that that scoundrel will not 
enter moscow these words showed pierre clearly for the first time that the french would 
enter moscow the second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at vyázma that count wittgenstein 
had defeated the french but that as many of the inhabitants of moscow wished to 
be armed weapons were ready for them at the arsenal sabers pistols and muskets which 
could be had at a low price the tone of the proclamation was not as 
jocose as in the former chigírin talks pierre pondered over these broadsheets evidently the terrible 
stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused 
involuntary horror in him was drawing near i join the army and enter the service 
or wait he asked himself for the hundredth time he took a pack of cards 
that lay on the table and began to lay them out for a game of 
patience this patience comes out he said to himself after shuffling the cards holding them 
in his hand and lifting his head it comes out it means what does it 
mean he had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of 
the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in it will mean 
that i must go to the army said pierre to himself in come in he 
added to the princess only the eldest princess the one with the stony face and 
long waist was still living in house the two younger ones had both married my 
coming to you cousin she said in a reproachful and agitated voice know some decision 
must be come to what is going to happen everyone has left moscow and the 
people are rioting how is it that we are staying on the contrary things seem 
satisfactory ma cousine said pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her always 
feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor indeed very satisfactory barbara ivánovna told me 
today how our troops are distinguishing themselves it certainly does them credit and the people 
too are quite no longer obey even my maid has taken to being rude at 
this rate they will soon begin beating us one walk in the streets but above 
all the french will be here any day now so what are we waiting for 
i ask just one thing of you cousin she went on for me to be 
taken to petersburg whatever i may be i live under rule come ma cousine where 
do you get your information from on the contrary submit to your napoleon others may 
if they please if you want to do this i will give the order at 
once the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with muttering 
to herself she sat down on a chair you have been misinformed said pierre is 
quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger see just been reading 
he showed her the broadsheet rostopchín writes that he will stake his life on it 
that the enemy will not enter moscow that count of yours said the princess malevolently 
is a hypocrite a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot he write 
in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone it might be should be dragged to the lockup 
by his how silly honor and glory to whoever captures him he says this is 
what his cajolery has brought us to barbara ivánovna told me the mob near killed 
her because she said something in french but so you take everything so to heart 
said pierre and began laying out his cards for patience although that patience did come 
out pierre did not join the army but remained in deserted moscow ever in the 
same state of agitation irresolution and alarm yet at the same time joyfully expecting something 
terrible next day toward evening the princess set off and head steward came to inform 
him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment could not be found 
without selling one of the estates in general the head steward made out to pierre 
that his project of raising a regiment would ruin him pierre listened to him scarcely 
able to repress a smile then sell it said he to be done i draw 
back now the worse everything became especially his own affairs the better was pierre pleased 
and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected was approaching hardly anyone 
he knew was left in town julie had gone and so had princess mary of 
his intimate friends only the rostóvs remained but he did not go to see them 
to distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of vorontsóvo to see 
the great balloon leppich was constructing to destroy the foe and a trial balloon that 
was to go up next day the balloon was not yet ready but pierre learned 
that it was being constructed by the desire the emperor had written to count rostopchín 
as follows as soon as leppich is ready get together a crew of reliable and 
intelligent men for his car and send a courier to general kutúzov to let him 
know i have informed him of the matter please impress upon leppich to be very 
careful where he descends for the first time that he may not make a mistake 
and fall into the hands it is essential for him to combine his movements with 
those of the commander in chief on his way home from vorontsóvo as he was 
passing the bolótnoe place pierre seeing a large crowd round the lóbnoe place stopped and 
got out of his trap a french cook accused of being a spy was being 
flogged the flogging was only just over and the executioner was releasing from the flogging 
bench a stout man with red whiskers in blue stockings and a green jacket who 
was moaning piteously another criminal thin and pale stood near judging by their faces they 
were both frenchmen with a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin face 
pierre pushed his way in through the crowd is it who is it what is 
it for he kept asking but the attention of the burghers shopkeepers peasants and women 
in cloaks and in so eagerly centered on what was passing in lóbnoe place that 
no one answered him the stout man rose frowned shrugged his shoulders and evidently trying 
to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him but suddenly 
his lips trembled and he began to cry in the way full blooded grown up 
men cry though angry with himself for doing so in the crowd people began talking 
loudly to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to pierre cook to some 
prince mounseer russian sauce seems to be sour to a frenchman sets his teeth on 
edge said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierre when the frenchman began to 
cry the clerk glanced round evidently hoping that his joke would be appreciated some people 
began to laugh others continued to watch in dismay the executioner who was undressing the 
other man pierre choked his face puckered and he turned hastily away went back to 
his trap muttering something to himself as he went and took his seat as they 
drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that the coachman asked him 
is your pleasure are you going shouted pierre to the man who was driving to 
lubyánka street the as you ordered answered the coachman idiot shouted pierre abusing his thing 
he rarely did i told you and drive faster blockhead must get away this very 
day he murmured to himself at the sight of the tortured frenchman and the crowd 
surrounding the lóbnoe place pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could 
no longer remain in moscow and would leave for the army that very day that 
it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the 
man ought to have known it for himself on reaching home pierre gave orders to 
head coachman who knew everything could do anything and was known to all he would 
leave that night for the army at mozháysk and that his saddle horses should be 
sent there this could not all be arranged that day so on representation pierre had 
to put off his departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses 
to be sent on in advance on the twenty fourth the weather cleared up after 
a spell of rain and after dinner pierre left moscow when changing horses that night 
in perkhúshkovo he learned that there had been a great battle that evening this was 
the battle of shevárdino he was told that there in perkhúshkovo the earth trembled from 
the firing but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won at dawn 
next day pierre was approaching mozháysk every house in mozháysk had soldiers quartered in it 
and at the hostel where pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was 
no room to be had it was full of officers everywhere in mozháysk and beyond 
it troops were stationed or on the march cossacks foot and horse soldiers wagons caissons 
and cannon were everywhere pierre pushed forward as fast as he could and the farther 
he left moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the 
more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had 
not experienced before it was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the 
slobóda palace during the sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something he 
now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes comforts of life wealth even life 
rubbish it is pleasant to throw away compared with something with what pierre could not 
say and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt 
such particular delight in sacrificing everything he was not occupied with the question of what 
to sacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous 
sensation chapter xix on the twenty fourth of august the battle of the shevárdino redoubt 
was fought on the twenty fifth not a shot was fired by either side and 
on the twenty sixth the battle of borodinó itself took place why and how were 
the battles of shevárdino and borodinó given and accepted why was the battle of borodinó 
fought there was not the least sense in it for either the french or the 
russians its immediate result for the russians was and was bound to be that we 
were brought nearer to the destruction of we feared more than anything in the world 
and for the french its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the 
destruction of their whole they feared more than anything in the world what the result 
must be was quite obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutúzov accepted that battle if 
the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it must have been 
obvious to napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability 
of losing a quarter of his army he was advancing to certain destruction and it 
must have been equally clear to kutúzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss 
of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose moscow for kutúzov this was 
mathematically clear as it is that if when playing draughts i have one man less 
and go on exchanging i shall certainly lose and therefore should not exchange when my 
opponent has sixteen men and i have fourteen i am only one eighth weaker than 
he but when i have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times as 
strong as i am before the battle of borodinó our strength in proportion to the 
french was about as five to six but after that battle it was little more 
than one to two previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty 
thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand yet the shrewd and 
experienced kutúzov accepted the battle while napoleon who was said to be a commander of 
genius gave it losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication 
still more if it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying 
moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying vienna there is much evidence 
to the contrary historians themselves tell us that from smolénsk onwards he wished to stop 
knew the danger of his extended position and knew that the occupation of moscow would 
not be the end of the campaign for he had seen at smolénsk the state 
in which russian towns were left to him and had not received a single reply 
to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate in giving and accepting battle at 
borodinó kutúzov acted involuntarily and irrationally but later on to fit what had occurred the 
historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the generals who of 
all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and involuntary the ancients have 
left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the whole interest of the 
story and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our 
epoch histories of that kind are meaningless on the other question how the battle of 
borodinó and the preceding battle of shevárdino were fought there also exists a definite and 
well known but quite false conception all the historians describe the affair as follows the 
russian army they say in its retreat from smolénsk sought out for itself the best 
position for a general engagement and found such a position at borodinó the russians they 
say fortified this position in advance on the left of the highroad from moscow to 
smolénsk and almost at a right angle to it from borodinó to utítsa at the 
very place where the battle was fought in front of this position they say a 
fortified outpost was set up on the shevárdino mound to observe the enemy on the 
twenty fourth we are told napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it and on 
the twenty sixth attacked the whole russian army which was in position on the field 
of borodinó so the histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who 
cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself the russians did not seek 
out the best position but on the contrary during the retreat passed many positions better 
than borodinó they did not stop at any one of these positions because kutúzov did 
not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen because the popular demand 
for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough and because milorádovich had not 
yet arrived with the militia and for many other reasons the fact is that other 
positions they had passed were stronger and that the position at borodinó the one where 
the battle was fought far from being strong was no more a position than any 
other spot one might find in the russian empire by sticking a pin into the 
map at hazard not only did the russians not fortify the position on the field 
of borodinó to the left of and at a right angle to the highroad that 
is the position on which the battle took place but never till the twenty fifth 
of august 1812 did they think that a battle might be fought there this was 
shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth 
and that those begun on the twenty fifth and twenty sixth were not completed and 
secondly by the position of the shevárdino redoubt that redoubt was quite senseless in front 
of the position where the battle was accepted why was it more strongly fortified than 
any other post and why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to 
defend it till late at night on the twenty fourth a cossack patrol would have 
sufficed to observe the enemy thirdly as proof that the position on which the battle 
was fought had not been foreseen and that the shevárdino redoubt was not an advanced 
post of that position we have the fact that up to the twenty fifth barclay 
de tolly and bagratión were convinced that the shevárdino redoubt was the left flank of 
the position and that kutúzov himself in his report written in hot haste after the 
battle speaks of the shevárdino redoubt as the left flank of the position it was 
much later when reports on the battle of borodinó were written at leisure that the 
incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in 
chief who had to be represented as infallible that the shevárdino redoubt was an advanced 
in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left that the battle of 
borodinó was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected whereas it was fought 
on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched the case was evidently this a 
position was selected along the river crosses the highroad not at a right angle but 
at an acute that the left flank was at shevárdino the right flank near the 
village of nóvoe and the center at borodinó at the confluence of the rivers kolochá 
and vóyna to anyone who looks at the field of borodinó without thinking of how 
the battle was actually fought this position protected by the river kolochá presents itself as 
obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the 
smolénsk road to moscow napoleon riding to valúevo on the twenty fourth did not see 
as the history books say he did the position of the russians from utítsa to 
borodinó he could not have seen that position because it did not exist nor did 
he see an advanced post of the russian army but while pursuing the russian rearguard 
he came upon the left flank of the russian the shevárdino unexpectedly for the russians 
moved his army across the kolochá and the russians not having time to begin a 
general engagement withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and 
took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified by 
crossing to the other side of the kolochá to the left of the highroad napoleon 
shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left looking from the russian side and 
transferred it to the plain between utítsa semënovsk and plain no more advantageous as a 
position than any other plain in there the whole battle of the twenty sixth of 
august took place had napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty fourth 
to the kolochá and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt 
but had begun the attack next morning no one would have doubted that the shevárdino 
redoubt was the left flank of our position and the battle would have taken place 
where we expected it in that case we should probably have defended the shevárdino left 
more obstinately we should have attacked napoleon in the center or on the right and 
the engagement would have taken place on the twenty fifth in the position we intended 
and had fortified but as the attack on our left flank took place in the 
evening after the retreat of our rear guard that is immediately after the fight at 
gridnëva and as the russian commanders did not wish or were not in time to 
begin a general engagement then on the evening of the twenty fourth the first and 
chief action of the battle of borodinó was already lost on the twenty fourth and 
obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the twenty sixth after the 
loss of the shevárdino redoubt we found ourselves on the morning of the twenty fifth 
without a position for our left flank and were forced to bend it back and 
hastily entrench it where it chanced to be not only was the russian army on 
the twenty sixth defended by weak unfinished entrenchments but the disadvantage of that position was 
increased by the fact that the russian having fully realized what had happened namely the 
loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field 
of the forthcoming battle from right to their extended position from the village of nóvoe 
to utítsa and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the 
battle so it happened that throughout the whole battle the russians opposed the entire french 
army launched against our left flank with but half as many men action against utítsa 
and on the right flank against the french were actions distinct from the main course 
of the battle so the battle of borodinó did not take place at all as 
in an effort to conceal our mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory 
due to the russian army and people it has been described the battle of borodinó 
was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than 
those of the enemy but as a result of the loss of the shevárdino redoubt 
the russians fought the battle of borodinó on an open and almost unentrenched position with 
forces only half as numerous as the french that is to say under conditions in 
which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive 
result but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight chapter xx 
on the morning of the twenty fifth pierre was leaving mozháysk at the descent of 
the high steep hill down which a winding road led out of the town past 
the cathedral on the right where a service was being held and the bells were 
ringing pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot behind him a cavalry 
regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers coming up toward him was 
a train of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day 
before the peasant drivers shouting and lashing their horses kept crossing from side to side 
the carts in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting 
jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it 
something like a road the wounded bandaged with rags with pale cheeks compressed lips and 
knitted brows held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against 
one another almost all of them stared with naïve childlike curiosity at white hat and 
green swallow tail coat coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to 
one side of the road the cavalry regiment as it descended the hill with its 
singers surrounded carriage and blocked the road pierre stopped being pressed against the side of 
the cutting in which the road ran the sunshine from behind the hill did not 
penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp but above head was 
the bright august sunshine and the bells sounded merrily one of the carts with wounded 
stopped by the side of the road close to pierre the driver in his bast 
shoes ran panting up to it placed a stone under one of its tireless hind 
wheels and began arranging the breech band on his little horse one of the wounded 
an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot caught 
hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at pierre say fellow 
countryman will they set us down here or take us on to moscow he asked 
pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question he was 
looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded now at 
the cart by which he was standing in which two wounded men were sitting and 
one was lying one of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded 
in the cheek his whole head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen 
to the size of a head his nose and mouth were twisted to one side 
this soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself another a young lad a 
fair haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face 
looked at pierre kindly with a fixed smile the third lay prone so that his 
face was not visible the cavalry singers were passing close by ah lost quite lost 
is my head so keen living in a foreign land they sang their dance song 
as if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment the metallic sound 
of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of the sun bathed the 
top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment but beneath the slope 
by the cart with the wounded near the panting little nag where pierre stood it 
was damp somber and sad the soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the 
cavalry singers the coxcombs he muttered reproachfully not the soldiers only but seen peasants today 
too the they have to go said the soldier behind the cart addressing pierre with 
a sad smile distinctions made nowadays they want the whole nation to fall on a 
word moscow they want to make an end of it in spite of the obscurity 
of the words pierre understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval the road 
was clear again pierre descended the hill and drove on he kept looking to either 
side of the road for familiar faces but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of 
various military men of different branches of the service who all looked with astonishment at 
his white hat and green tail coat having gone nearly three miles he at last 
met an acquaintance and eagerly addressed him this was one of the head army doctors 
he was driving toward pierre in a covered gig sitting beside a young surgeon and 
on recognizing pierre he told the cossack who occupied the seat to pull up your 
excellency how come you to be here asked the doctor you know i wanted to 
see yes there will be something to see pierre got out and talked to the 
doctor explaining his intention of taking part in a battle the doctor advised him to 
apply direct to kutúzov should you be god knows where out of sight during the 
battle he said exchanging glances with his young companion his serene highness knows you and 
will receive you graciously what you must do the doctor seemed tired and in a 
hurry think so ah i also wanted to ask you where our position is exactly 
said pierre position repeated the doctor not my line drive past tatárinova a lot of 
digging is going on there go up the hillock and see one see from there 
if you would but the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig would go 
with you but on my honor up to he pointed to his throat galloping to 
the commander of the corps how do matters stand you know count be a battle 
tomorrow out of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty 
thousand wounded and we stretchers or bunks or dressers or doctors enough for six thousand 
we have ten thousand carts but we need other things as must manage as best 
we can the strange thought that of the thousands of men young and old who 
had stared with merry surprise at his hat perhaps the very men he had noticed 
twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death amazed pierre may die tomorrow why 
are they thinking of anything but death and by some latent sequence of thought the 
descent of the mozháysk hill the carts with the wounded the ringing bells the slanting 
rays of the sun and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind 
cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment think 
of what awaits them but pass by winking at the wounded yet from among these 
men twenty thousand are doomed to die and they wonder at my hat strange thought 
pierre continuing his way to tatárinova in front of a house to the left of 
the road stood carriages wagons and crowds of orderlies and sentinels the commander in chief 
was putting up there but just when pierre arrived he was not in and hardly 
any of the staff were had gone to the church service pierre drove on toward 
górki when he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street he saw 
for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with crosses on their 
caps who talking and laughing loudly animated and perspiring were at work on a huge 
knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road some of them were digging 
others were wheeling barrowloads of earth along planks while others stood about doing nothing two 
officers were standing on the knoll directing the men on seeing these peasants who were 
evidently still amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers pierre once more thought 
of the wounded men at mozháysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he 
said want the whole nation to fall on them the sight of these bearded peasants 
at work on the battlefield with their queer clumsy boots and perspiring necks and their 
shirts opening from the left toward the middle unfastened exposing their sunburned collarbones impressed pierre 
more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet 
seen or heard chapter xxi pierre stepped out of his carriage and passing the toiling 
militiamen ascended the knoll from which according to the doctor the battlefield could be seen 
it was about eleven the sun shone somewhat to the left and behind him and 
brightly lit up the enormous panorama which rising like an amphitheater extended before him in 
the clear rarefied atmosphere from above on the left bisecting that amphitheater wound the smolénsk 
highroad passing through a village with a white church some five hundred paces in front 
of the knoll and below it this was borodinó below the village the road crossed 
the river by a bridge and winding down and up rose higher and higher to 
the village of valúevo visible about four miles away where napoleon was then stationed beyond 
valúevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon far in the distance 
in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road the cross and 
belfry of the kolochá monastery gleamed in the sun here and there over the whole 
of that blue expanse to right and left of the forest and the road smoking 
campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of and the the ground to the the 
course of the kolochá and moskvá broken and hilly between the hollows the villages of 
bezúbova and zakhárino showed in the distance on the left the ground was more level 
there were fields of grain and the smoking ruins of semënovsk which had been burned 
down could be seen all that pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left 
nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations nowhere could he see 
the battlefield he had expected to find but only fields meadows troops woods the smoke 
of campfires villages mounds and streams and try as he would he could descry no 
military in this place which teemed with life nor could he even distinguish our troops 
from the must ask someone who knows he thought and addressed an officer who was 
looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure i ask you said pierre village that 
is in front it said the officer turning to his companion the other corrected him 
the officer evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk moved up to pierre those 
our men there pierre inquired and there further on are the french said the officer 
they are there you can see them where asked pierre can see them with the 
naked eye why there the officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on 
the left beyond the river and the same stern and serious expression that pierre had 
noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face those are 
the french and over there pierre pointed to a knoll on the left near which 
some troops could be seen are ours ours and there pierre pointed to another knoll 
in the distance with a big tree on it near a village that lay in 
a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible his again 
said the officer it was the shevárdino redoubt was ours yesterday but now it is 
his how about our position position replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction can 
tell you quite clearly because i constructed nearly all our entrenchments there you see our 
center at borodinó just there and he pointed to the village in front of them 
with the white church where one crosses the kolochá you see down there where the 
rows of hay are lying in the hollow the bridge our center our right flank 
is over pointed sharply to the right far away in the broken where the moskvá 
river is and we have thrown up three redoubts there very strong ones the left 
flank here the officer paused you see difficult to explain yesterday our left flank was 
there at shevárdino you see where the oak is but now we have withdrawn our 
left it is over there do you see that village and the smoke semënovsk yes 
there he pointed to knoll the battle will hardly be there his having moved his 
troops there is only a ruse he will probably pass round to the right of 
the moskvá but wherever it may be many a man will be missing tomorrow he 
remarked an elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving these explanations 
had waited in silence for him to finish speaking but at this point evidently not 
liking the remark interrupted him must be sent for said he sternly the officer appeared 
abashed as though he understood that one might think of how many men would be 
missing tomorrow but ought not to speak of it send number three company again the 
officer replied hurriedly you are you one of the doctors come on my own answered 
pierre and he went down the hill again passing the militiamen those damned fellows muttered 
the officer who followed him holding his nose as he ran past the men at 
work they are bringing her coming there they are be here in a minute voices 
were suddenly heard saying and officers soldiers and militiamen began running forward along the road 
a church procession was coming up the hill from borodinó first along the dusty road 
came the infantry in ranks bareheaded and with arms reversed from behind them came the 
sound of church singing soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past pierre toward the procession are 
bringing her our protectress the iberian mother of god someone cried smolénsk mother of god 
another corrected him the militiamen both those who had been in the village and those 
who had been at work on the battery threw down their spades and ran to 
meet the church procession following the battalion that marched along the dusty road came priests 
in their little old man in a hood with attendants and singers behind them soldiers 
and officers bore a large dark faced icon with an embossed metal cover this was 
the icon that had been brought from smolénsk and had since accompanied the army behind 
before and on both sides crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked ran and bowed 
to the ground at the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon the 
men who had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were 
relieved by others the chanters relit their censers and service began the hot rays of 
the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of 
the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon the singing did not sound 
loud under the open sky an immense crowd of bareheaded officers soldiers and militiamen surrounded 
the icon behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved 
for them a bald general with a st cross on his neck stood just behind 
the back and without crossing himself he was evidently a german patiently awaited the end 
of the service which he considered it necessary to hear to the end probably to 
arouse the patriotism of the russian people another general stood in a martial pose crossing 
himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while looking about him standing 
among the crowd of peasants pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables but did not 
look at whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious expression on the faces of 
the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon as 
soon as the tired chanters who were singing the service for the twentieth time that 
day began lazily and mechanically to sing from calamity thy servants o mother of god 
and the priest and deacon chimed in to thee under god we all flee as 
to an inviolable bulwark and protection there again kindled in all those faces the same 
expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that pierre had seen on 
the faces at the foot of the hill at mozháysk and momentarily on many and 
many faces he had met that morning and heads were bowed more frequently and hair 
tossed back and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard 
the crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against pierre someone a very important 
personage judging by the haste with which way was made for him was approaching the 
icon it was kutúzov who had been riding round the position and on his way 
back to tatárinova had stopped where the service was being held pierre recognized him at 
once by his peculiar figure which distinguished him from everybody else with a long overcoat 
on his exceedingly stout round shouldered body with uncovered white head and puffy face showing 
the white ball of the eye he had lost kutúzov walked with plunging swaying gait 
into the crowd and stopped behind the priest he crossed himself with an accustomed movement 
bent till he touched the ground with his hand and bowed his white head with 
a deep sigh behind kutúzov was bennigsen and the suite despite the presence of the 
commander in chief who attracted the attention of all the superior officers the militiamen and 
soldiers continued their prayers without looking at him when the service was over kutúzov stepped 
up to the icon sank heavily to his knees bowed to the ground and for 
a long time tried vainly to rise but could not do so on account of 
his weakness and weight his white head twitched with the effort at last he rose 
kissed the icon as a child does with naïvely pouting lips and again bowed till 
he touched the ground with his hand the other generals followed his example then the 
officers and after them with excited faces pressing on one another crowding panting and pushing 
scrambled the soldiers and militiamen chapter xxii staggering amid the crush pierre looked about him 
peter kirílovich how did you get here said a voice pierre looked round borís drubetskóy 
brushing his knees with his hand he had probably soiled them when he too had 
knelt before the icon came up to him smiling borís was elegantly dressed with a 
slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign he wore a long coat and like kutúzov 
had a whip slung across his shoulder meanwhile kutúzov had reached the village and seated 
himself in the shade of the nearest house on a bench which one cossack had 
run to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug an immense and brilliant 
suite surrounded him the icon was carried further accompanied by the throng pierre stopped some 
thirty paces from kutúzov talking to borís he explained his wish to be present at 
the battle and to see the position is what you must do said borís will 
do the honors of the camp to you you will see everything best from where 
count bennigsen will be i am in attendance on him you know mention it to 
him but if you want to ride round the position come along with us we 
are just going to the left flank then when we get back do spend the 
night with me and arrange a game of cards of course you know dmítri sergéevich 
those are his quarters and he pointed to the third house in the village of 
górki i should like to see the right flank they say very strong said pierre 
should like to start from the moskvá river and ride round the whole position you 
can do that later but the chief thing is the left flank yes but where 
is prince regiment can you point it out to me we shall pass it and 
take you to him about the left flank asked pierre tell you the truth between 
ourselves god only knows what state our left flank is in said borís confidentially lowering 
his voice is not at all what count bennigsen intended he meant to fortify that 
knoll quite differently but borís shrugged his shoulders serene highness would not have it or 
someone persuaded him you see but borís did not finish for at that moment kaysárov 
adjutant came up to pierre kaysárov said borís addressing him with an unembarrassed smile was 
just trying to explain our position to the count it is amazing how his serene 
highness could so foresee the intentions of the french mean the left flank asked kaysárov 
exactly the left flank is now extremely strong though kutúzov had dismissed all unnecessary men 
from the staff borís had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes he had 
established himself with count bennigsen who like all on whom borís had been in attendance 
considered young prince drubetskóy an invaluable man in the higher command there were two sharply 
defined parties party and that of bennigsen the chief of staff borís belonged to the 
latter and no one else while showing servile respect to kutúzov could so create an 
impression that the old fellow was not much good and that bennigsen managed everything now 
the decisive moment of battle had come when kutúzov would be destroyed and the power 
pass to bennigsen or even if kutúzov won the battle it would be felt that 
everything was done by bennigsen in any case many great rewards would have to be 
given for action and new men would come to the front so borís was full 
of nervous vivacity all day after kaysárov others whom pierre knew came up to him 
and he had not time to reply to all the questions about moscow that were 
showered upon him or to listen to all that was told him the faces all 
expressed animation and apprehension but it seemed to pierre that the cause of the excitement 
shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success his mind 
however was occupied by the different expression he saw on other expression that spoke not 
of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death kutúzov noticed figure 
and the group gathered round him him to me said kutúzov an adjutant told pierre 
of his serene wish and pierre went toward bench but a militiaman got there before 
him it was dólokhov did that fellow get here asked pierre a creature that wriggles 
in anywhere was the answer has been degraded you know now he wants to bob 
up again been proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the picket line 
at night a brave fellow pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to kutúzov 
concluded that if i reported to your serene highness you might send me away or 
say that you knew what i was reporting but then i lose anything dólokhov was 
saying yes if i were right i should be rendering a service to my fatherland 
for which i am ready to die yes should your serene highness require a man 
who will not spare his skin please think of me perhaps i may prove useful 
to your serene highness yes kutúzov repeated his laughing eye narrowing more and more as 
he looked at pierre just then borís with his courtierlike adroitness stepped up to side 
near kutúzov and in a most natural manner without raising his voice said to pierre 
as though continuing an interrupted conversation militia have put on clean white shirts to be 
ready to die what heroism count borís evidently said this to pierre in order to 
be overheard by his serene highness he knew attention would be caught by those words 
and so it was are you saying about the militia he asked borís for tomorrow 
your serene have put on clean shirts a wonderful a matchless people said kutúzov and 
he closed his eyes and swayed his head matchless people he repeated with a sigh 
you want to smell gunpowder he said to pierre a pleasant smell i have the 
honor to be one of your adorers is she well my quarters are at your 
service and as often happens with old people kutúzov began looking about absent mindedly as 
if forgetting all he wanted to say or do then evidently remembering what he wanted 
he beckoned to andrew kaysárov his brother verses those verses of how do they go 
eh those he wrote about gerákov for the corps recite them recite them said he 
evidently preparing to laugh kaysárov recited kutúzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of 
the verses when pierre had left kutúzov dólokhov came up to him and took his 
hand am very glad to meet you here count he said aloud regardless of the 
presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone the eve of a 
day when god alone knows who of us is fated to survive i am glad 
of this opportunity to tell you that i regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us 
and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me i beg you 
to forgive me pierre looked at dólokhov with a smile not knowing what to say 
to him with tears in his eyes dólokhov embraced pierre and kissed him borís said 
a few words to his general and count bennigsen turned to pierre and proposed that 
he should ride with him along the line will interest you said he very much 
replied pierre half an hour later kutúzov left for tatárinova and bennigsen and his suite 
with pierre among them set out on their ride along the line chapter xxiii from 
górki bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which when they had looked at it 
from the hill the officer had pointed out as being the center of our position 
and where rows of fragrant new mown hay lay by the riverside they rode across 
that bridge into the village of borodinó and thence turned to the left passing an 
enormous number of troops and guns and came to a high knoll where militiamen were 
digging this was the redoubt as yet unnamed which afterwards became known as the raévski 
redoubt or the knoll battery but pierre paid no special attention to it he did 
not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on 
the plain of borodinó they then crossed the hollow to semënovsk where the soldiers were 
dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns then they rode downhill and 
uphill across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by hail following a track 
freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed land and reached some 
flèches which were still being dug a kind of entrenchment at the flèches bennigsen stopped 
and began looking at the shevárdino redoubt opposite which had been ours the day before 
and where several horsemen could be descried the officers said that either napoleon or murat 
was there and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of horsemen pierre also 
looked at them trying to guess which of the scarcely discernible figures was napoleon at 
last those mounted men rode away from the mound and disappeared bennigsen spoke to a 
general who approached him and began explaining the whole position of our troops pierre listened 
to him straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle but 
was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the task he could 
make nothing of it bennigsen stopped speaking and noticing that pierre was listening suddenly said 
to him think this interests you the contrary very interesting replied pierre not quite truthfully 
from the flèches they rode still farther to the left along a road winding through 
a thick low growing birch wood in the middle of the wood a brown hare 
with white feet sprang out and scared by the tramp of the many horses grew 
so confused that it leaped along the road in front of them for some time 
arousing general attention and laughter and only when several voices shouted at it did it 
dart to one side and disappear in the thicket after going through the wood for 
about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of 
corps were stationed to defend the left flank here at the extreme left flank bennigsen 
talked a great deal and with much heat and as it seemed to pierre gave 
orders of great military importance in front of troops was some high ground not occupied 
by troops bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake saying that it was madness to leave a 
height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it some of 
the generals expressed the same opinion one in particular declared with martial heat that they 
were put there to be slaughtered bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to 
occupy the high ground this disposition on the left flank increased doubt of his own 
capacity to understand military matters listening to bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of 
the troops behind the hill he quite understood them and shared their opinion but for 
that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind 
the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder pierre did not know 
that these troops were not as bennigsen supposed put there to defend the position but 
were in a concealed position as an ambush that they should not be seen and 
might be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly bennigsen did not know this and 
moved the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the matter to the 
commander in chief chapter xxiv on that bright evening of august 25 prince andrew lay 
leaning on his elbow in a broken down shed in the village of knyazkóvo at 
the further end of his encampment through a gap in the broken wall he could 
see beside the wooden fence a row of thirty year old birches with their lower 
branches lopped off a field on which shocks of oats were standing and some bushes 
near which rose the smoke of kitchens narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as 
his life now seemed to him prince andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated 
and irritable as he had done seven years before at austerlitz he had received and 
given the orders for next battle and had nothing more to do but his simplest 
clearest and therefore most terrible give him no peace he knew that battle would be 
the most terrible of all he had taken part in and for the first time 
in his life the possibility of death presented itself to in relation to any worldly 
matter or with reference to its effect on others but simply in relation to himself 
to his own plainly terribly and almost as a certainty and from the height of 
this perception all that had previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a 
cold white light without shadows without perspective without distinction of outline all life appeared to 
him like magic lantern pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light 
through a glass now he suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and 
without a glass yes there they are those false images that agitated enraptured and tormented 
me said he to himself passing in review the principal pictures of the magic lantern 
of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of his clear perception 
of death they are those rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious glory 
the good of society love of a woman the fatherland important these pictures appeared to 
me with what profound meaning they seemed to be filled and it is all so 
simple pale and crude in the cold white light of this morning which i feel 
is dawning for me the three great sorrows of his life held his attention in 
particular his love for a woman his death and the french invasion which had overrun 
half russia that little girl who seemed to me brimming over with mystic forces yes 
indeed i loved her i made romantic plans of love and happiness with her oh 
what a boy i was he said aloud bitterly me i believed in some ideal 
love which was to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my 
absence like the gentle dove in the fable she was to pine apart from me 
but it was much simpler really it was all very simple and horrible my father 
built bald hills he thought the place was his his land his air his peasants 
but napoleon came and swept him aside unconscious of his existence as he might brush 
a chip from his path and his bald hills and his whole life fell to 
pieces princess mary says it is a trial sent from above what is the trial 
for when he is not here and will never return he is not here for 
whom then is the trial intended the fatherland the destruction of moscow and tomorrow i 
shall be killed perhaps not even by a frenchman but by one of our own 
men by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them 
did yesterday and the french will come and take me by head and heels and 
fling me into a hole that i may not stink under their noses and new 
conditions of life will arise which will seem quite ordinary to others and about which 
i shall know nothing i shall not exist he looked at the row of birches 
shining in the sunshine with their motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark die 
to be killed tomorrow that i should not exist that all this should still be 
but no me and the birches with their light and shade the curly clouds the 
smoke of the campfires and all that was around him changed and seemed terrible and 
menacing a cold shiver ran down his spine he rose quickly went out of the 
shed and began to walk about after he had returned voices were heard outside the 
shed that he cried the red nosed captain timókhin formerly squadron commander but now from 
lack of officers a battalion commander shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and 
the regimental paymaster prince andrew rose hastily listened to the business they had come about 
gave them some further instructions and was about to dismiss them when he heard a 
familiar lisping voice behind the shed take it said the voice of a man stumbling 
over something prince andrew looked out of the shed and saw pierre who had tripped 
over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen coming his way it was 
unpleasant to prince andrew to meet people of his own set in general and pierre 
especially for he reminded him of all the painful moments of his last visit to 
moscow what a surprise said he brings you here this is unexpected as he said 
this his eyes and face expressed more than expressed hostility which pierre noticed at once 
he had approached the shed full of animation but on seeing prince face he felt 
constrained and ill at ease have come simply you know come it interests me said 
pierre who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word wish to see the 
battle yes and what do the masonic brothers say about war how would they stop 
it said prince andrew sarcastically and moscow and my people have they reached moscow at 
last he asked seriously they have julie drubetskáya told me so i went to see 
them but missed them they have gone to your estate near moscow chapter xxv the 
officers were about to take leave but prince andrew apparently reluctant to be left alone 
with his friend asked them to stay and have tea seats were brought in and 
so was the tea the officers gazed with surprise at huge stout figure and listened 
to his talk of moscow and the position of our army round which he had 
ridden prince andrew remained silent and his expression was so forbidding that pierre addressed his 
remarks chiefly to the good natured battalion commander you understand the whole position of our 
troops prince andrew interrupted him is how do you mean said pierre being a military 
man i say i have understood it fully but i understand the general position then 
you know more than anyone else be it who it may said prince andrew said 
pierre looking over his spectacles in perplexity at prince andrew and what do you think 
of appointment he asked was very glad of his appointment all i know replied prince 
andrew tell me your opinion of barclay de tolly in moscow they are saying heaven 
knows what about him what do you think of him them replied prince andrew indicating 
the officers pierre looked at timókhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily 
addressed that officer see light again since his serenity has been appointed your excellency said 
timókhin timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel so asked pierre to mention 
only firewood and fodder let me inform you why when we were retreating from sventsyáni 
we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything you see 
we were going away so he would get it all it so your excellency and 
again timókhin turned to the prince we in our regiment two officers were court martialed 
for that kind of thing but when his serenity took command everything became straightforward now 
we see light why was it forbidden timókhin looked about in confusion not knowing what 
or how to answer such a question pierre put the same question to prince andrew 
so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy said 
prince andrew with venomous irony is very sound one permit the land to be pillaged 
and accustom the troops to marauding at smolénsk too he judged correctly that the french 
might outflank us as they had larger forces but he could not understand this cried 
prince andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily could not understand 
that there for the first time we were fighting for russian soil and that there 
was a spirit in the men such as i had never seen before that we 
had held the french for two days and that that success had increased our strength 
tenfold he ordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothing 
he had no thought of betraying us he tried to do the best he could 
he thought out everything and that is why he is unsuitable he is unsuitable now 
just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every german has to 
how can i explain well say your father has a german valet and he is 
a splendid valet and satisfies your requirements better than you could then all right to 
let him serve but if your father is mortally sick send the valet away and 
attend to your father with your own unpracticed awkward hands and will soothe him better 
than a skilled man who is a stranger could so it has been with barclay 
while russia was well a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister but 
as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin but 
in your club they have been making him out a traitor they slander him as 
a traitor and the only result will be that afterwards ashamed of their false accusations 
they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor and 
that will be still more unjust he is an honest and very punctilious german they 
say a skillful commander rejoined pierre understand what is meant by skillful commander replied prince 
andrew ironically skillful commander replied pierre one who foresees all contingencies and foresees the intentions 
impossible said prince andrew as if it were a matter settled long ago pierre looked 
at him in surprise yet they say that war is like a game of chess 
he remarked replied prince andrew with this little difference that in chess you may think 
over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time and 
with this difference too that a knight is always stronger than a pawn and two 
pawns are always stronger than one while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than 
a division and sometimes weaker than a company the relative strength of bodies of troops 
can never be known to anyone believe me he went on things depended on arrangements 
made by the staff i should be there making arrangements but instead of that i 
have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen and i consider 
that on us battle will depend and not on those others success never depends and 
never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbers and least of all 
on position on what then the feeling that is in me and in him he 
pointed to timókhin in each soldier prince andrew glanced at timókhin who looked at his 
commander in alarm and bewilderment in contrast to his former reticent taciturnity prince andrew now 
seemed excited he could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred 
to him battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it why did 
we lose the battle at austerlitz the french losses were almost equal to ours but 
very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle and we did 
lose it and we said so because we had nothing to fight for there we 
wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could lost so let 
us run and we ran if we had not said that till the evening heaven 
knows what might not have happened but tomorrow we say it you talk about our 
position the left flank weak and the right flank too extended he went on all 
nonsense nothing of the kind but what awaits us tomorrow a hundred million most diverse 
chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that our men or 
theirs run or do not run and that this man or that man is killed 
but all that is being done at present is only play the fact is that 
those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help 
matters but hinder they are only concerned with their own petty interests such a moment 
said pierre reproachfully such a moment prince andrew repeated them it is only a moment 
affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon for me 
tomorrow means this a russian army of a hundred thousand and a french army of 
a hundred thousand have met to fight and the thing is that these two hundred 
thousand men will fight and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least 
will win and if you like i will tell you that whatever happens and whatever 
muddles those at the top may make we shall win battle tomorrow happen what may 
we shall win now your excellency the truth the real truth said timókhin would spare 
himself now the soldiers in my battalion believe me drink their vodka not the day 
for that they say all were silent the officers rose prince andrew went out of 
the shed with them giving final orders to the adjutant after they had gone pierre 
approached prince andrew and was about to start a conversation when they heard the clatter 
of three hoofs on the road not far from the shed and looking in that 
direction prince andrew recognized wolzogen and clausewitz accompanied by a cossack they rode close by 
continuing to converse and prince andrew involuntarily heard these words krieg muss in raum verlegt 
werden der ansicht kann ich nicht genug preis geben said one of them war must 
be extended widely i cannot sufficiently commend that view ja said the other zweck ist 
nur den feind zu schwächen so kann man gewiss nicht den verlust der privat personen 
in achtung nehmen yes the only aim is to weaken the enemy so of course 
one cannot take into account the loss of private individuals no agreed the other widely 
said prince andrew with an angry snort when they had ridden past that were my 
father son and sister at bald hills all the same to him what i was 
saying to german gentlemen win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess 
they can because they have nothing in their german heads but theories not worth an 
empty eggshell and in their hearts the one thing needed which timókhin has they have 
yielded up all europe to him and have now come to teach us fine teachers 
and again his voice grew shrill you think we shall win battle asked pierre yes 
answered prince andrew absently thing i would do if i had the power he began 
again would not take prisoners why take prisoners chivalry the french have destroyed my home 
and are on their way to destroy moscow they have outraged and are outraging me 
every moment they are my enemies in my opinion they are all criminals and so 
thinks timókhin and the whole army they should be executed since they are my foes 
they cannot be my friends whatever may have been said at tilsit yes muttered pierre 
looking with shining eyes at prince andrew quite agree with you the question that had 
perturbed pierre on the mozháysk hill and all that day now seemed to him quite 
clear and completely solved he now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war 
and of the impending battle all he had seen that day all the significant and 
stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing were lit up for him 
by a new light he understood that latent heat as they say in physics of 
patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen and this explained to 
him why they all prepared for death calmly and as it were lightheartedly take prisoners 
prince andrew continued by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less 
cruel as it is we have played at vile we play at magnanimity and all 
that stuff such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady 
who faints when she sees a calf being killed she is so kindhearted that she 
look at blood but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce they talk to 
us of the rules of war of chivalry of flags of truce of mercy to 
the unfortunate and so on all rubbish i saw chivalry and flags of truce in 
1805 they humbugged us and we humbugged them they plunder other houses issue false paper 
money and worst of all they kill my children and my father and then talk 
of rules of war and magnanimity to foes take no prisoners but kill and be 
killed he who has come to this as i have through the same sufferings prince 
andrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not moscow 
was taken as smolénsk had been was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected 
cramp in his throat he paced up and down a few times in silence but 
his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking there was none 
of this magnanimity in war we should go to war only when it was worth 
while going to certain death as now then there would not be war because paul 
ivánovich had offended michael ivánovich and when there was a war like this one it 
would be war and then the determination of the troops would be quite different then 
all these westphalians and hessians whom napoleon is leading would not follow him into russia 
and we should not go to fight in austria and prussia without knowing why war 
is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life and we ought to understand 
that and not play at war we ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and 
seriously it all lies in that get rid of falsehood and let war be war 
and not a game as it is now war is the favorite pastime of the 
idle and frivolous the military calling is the most highly honored what is war what 
is needed for success in warfare what are the habits of the military the aim 
of war is murder the methods of war are spying treachery and their encouragement the 
ruin of a inhabitants robbing them or stealing to provision the army and fraud and 
falsehood termed military craft the habits of the military class are the absence of freedom 
that is discipline idleness ignorance cruelty debauchery and drunkenness and in spite of all this 
it is the highest class respected by everyone all the kings except the chinese wear 
military uniforms and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards meet as we 
shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they kill and maim tens of thousands and 
then have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people they even exaggerate the number 
and they announce a victory supposing that the more people they have killed the greater 
their achievement how does god above look at them and hear them exclaimed prince andrew 
in a shrill piercing voice my friend it has of late become hard for me 
to live i see that i have begun to understand too much and it do 
for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil ah well 
not for long he added sleepy and time for me to sleep go back to 
górki said prince andrew suddenly no pierre replied looking at prince andrew with frightened compassionate 
eyes go before a battle one must have sleep out repeated prince andrew he came 
quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed him by be off he shouted we 
meet again or not and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed it was already 
dark and pierre could not make out whether the expression of prince face was angry 
or tender for some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him 
or go away he does not want it pierre concluded i know that this is 
our last meeting he sighed deeply and rode back to górki on re entering the 
shed prince andrew lay down on a rug but he could not sleep he closed 
his eyes one picture succeeded another in his imagination on one of them he dwelt 
long and joyfully he vividly recalled an evening in petersburg natásha with animated and excited 
face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer 
and had lost her way in the big forest she incoherently described the depths of 
the forest her feelings and a talk with a beekeeper she met and constantly interrupted 
her story to say i not telling it right no you understand though he encouraged 
her by saying that he did understand and he really had understood all she wanted 
to say but natásha was not satisfied with her own words she felt that they 
did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and wished to 
convey was such a delightful old man and it was so dark in the forest 
and he had such kind no i describe it she had said flushed and excited 
prince andrew smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into 
her eyes understood her he thought not only understood her but it was just that 
inner spiritual force that sincerity that frankness of very soul of hers which seemed to 
be fettered by her was that soul i loved in her loved so strongly and 
happily and suddenly he remembered how his love had ended did not need anything of 
that kind he neither saw nor understood anything of the sort he only saw in 
her a pretty and fresh young girl with whom he did not deign to unite 
his fate and i and he is still alive and gay prince andrew jumped up 
as if someone had burned him and again began pacing up and down in front 
of the shed chapter xxvi on august 25 the eve of the battle of borodinó 
m de beausset prefect of the french palace arrived at quarters at valúevo with colonel 
fabvier the former from paris and the latter from madrid donning his court uniform m 
de beausset ordered a box he had brought for the emperor to be carried before 
him and entered the first compartment of tent where he began opening the box while 
conversing with aides de camp who surrounded him fabvier not entering the tent remained at 
the entrance talking to some generals of his acquaintance the emperor napoleon had not yet 
left his bedroom and was finishing his toilet slightly snorting and grunting he presented now 
his back and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet 
was rubbing him down another valet with his finger over the mouth of a bottle 
was sprinkling eau de cologne on the pampered body with an expression which seemed to 
say that he alone knew where and how much eau de cologne should be sprinkled 
short hair was wet and matted on the forehead but his face though puffy and 
yellow expressed physical satisfaction on harder go on he muttered to the valet who was 
rubbing him slightly twitching and grunting an aide de camp who had entered the bedroom 
to report to the emperor the number of prisoners taken in action was standing by 
the door after delivering his message awaiting permission to withdraw napoleon frowning looked at him 
from under his brows prisoners said he repeating the aide de words are forcing us 
to exterminate them so much the worse for the russian army go on harder harder 
he muttered hunching his back and presenting his fat shoulders right let monsieur de beausset 
enter and fabvier too he said nodding to the aide de camp sire and the 
aide de camp disappeared through the door of the tent two valets rapidly dressed his 
majesty and wearing the blue uniform of the guards he went with firm quick steps 
to the reception room de hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present he had 
brought from the empress on two chairs directly in front of the entrance but napoleon 
had dressed and come out with such unexpected rapidity that he had not time to 
finish arranging the surprise napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that 
they were not ready he did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of 
giving him a surprise so he pretended not to see de beausset and called fabvier 
to him listening silently and with a stern frown to what fabvier told him of 
the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at salamanca at the other end of 
europe with but one be worthy of their but one fail to please him the 
result of that battle had been deplorable napoleon made ironic remarks during account as if 
he had not expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence must make up 
for that in moscow said napoleon see you later he added and summoned de beausset 
who by that time had prepared the surprise having placed something on the chairs and 
covered it with a cloth de beausset bowed low with that courtly french bow which 
only the old retainers of the bourbons knew how to make and approached him presenting 
an envelope napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear have hurried here i 
am very glad well what is paris saying he asked suddenly changing his former stern 
expression for a most cordial tone all paris regrets your absence replied de beausset as 
was proper but though napoleon knew that de beausset had to say something of this 
kind and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue he was pleased 
to hear it from him again he honored him by touching his ear am very 
sorry to have made you travel so far said he i expected nothing less than 
to find you at the gates of moscow replied de beausset napoleon smiled and lifting 
his head absent mindedly glanced to the right an aide de camp approached with gliding 
steps and offered him a gold snuffbox which he took it has happened luckily for 
you he said raising the open snuffbox to his nose are fond of travel and 
in three days you will see moscow you surely did not expect to see that 
asiatic capital you will have a pleasant journey de beausset bowed gratefully at this regard 
for his taste for travel of which he had not till then been aware this 
asked napoleon noticing that all the courtiers were looking at something concealed under a cloth 
with courtly adroitness de beausset half turned and without turning his back to the emperor 
retired two steps twitching off the cloth at the same time and said present to 
your majesty from the empress it was a portrait painted in bright colors by gérard 
of the son borne to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria the 
boy whom for some reason everyone called king of rome a very pretty curly headed 
boy with a look of the christ in the sistine madonna was depicted playing at 
stick and ball the ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other 
hand a scepter though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by 
depicting the so called king of rome spiking the earth with a stick the allegory 
apparently seemed to napoleon as it had done to all who had seen it in 
paris quite clear and very pleasing king of rome he said pointing to the portrait 
with a graceful gesture with the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression 
of his face at will he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look 
of pensive tenderness he felt that what he now said and did would be historical 
and it seemed to him that it would now be best for grandeur enabled his 
son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial show in contrast to that grandeur 
the simplest paternal tenderness his eyes grew dim he moved forward glanced round at a 
chair which seemed to place itself under him and sat down on it before the 
portrait at a single gesture from him everyone went out on tiptoe leaving the great 
man to himself and his emotion having sat still for a while he not knowing 
thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait rose and recalled de 
beausset and the officer on duty he ordered the portrait to be carried outside his 
tent that the old guard stationed round it might not be deprived of the pleasure 
of seeing the king of rome the son and heir of their adored monarch and 
while he was doing m de beausset the honor of breakfasting with him they heard 
as napoleon had anticipated the rapturous cries of the officers and men of the old 
guard who had run up to see the portrait vive le roi de rome vive 
came those ecstatic cries after breakfast napoleon in de presence dictated his order of the 
day to the army and energetic he remarked when he had read over the proclamation 
which he had dictated straight off without corrections it ran soldiers this is the battle 
you have so longed for victory depends on you it is essential for us it 
will give us all we need comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country 
behave as you did at austerlitz friedland vítebsk and smolénsk let our remotest posterity recall 
your achievements this day with pride let it be said of each of you was 
in the great battle before moscow moscow repeated napoleon and inviting m de beausset who 
was so fond of travel to accompany him on his ride he went out of 
the tent to where the horses stood saddled majesty is too kind replied de beausset 
to the invitation to accompany the emperor he wanted to sleep did not know how 
to ride and was afraid of doing so but napoleon nodded to the traveler and 
de beausset had to mount when napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of 
the guards before his portrait grew still louder napoleon frowned him away he said pointing 
with a gracefully majestic gesture to the portrait is too soon for him to see 
a field of battle de beausset closed his eyes bowed his head and sighed deeply 
to indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the words chapter xxvii on the twenty 
fifth of august so his historians tell us napoleon spent the whole day on horseback 
inspecting the locality considering plans submitted to him by his marshals and personally giving commands 
to his generals the original line of the russian forces along the river kolochá had 
been dislocated by the capture of the shevárdino redoubt on the twenty fourth and part 
of the left been drawn back that part of the line was not entrenched and 
in front of it the ground was more open and level than elsewhere it was 
evident to anyone military or not that it was here the french should attack it 
would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion nor any particular 
care or trouble on the part of the emperor and his marshals nor was there 
any need of that special and supreme quality called genius that people are so apt 
to ascribe to napoleon yet the historians who described the event later and the men 
who then surrounded napoleon and he himself thought otherwise napoleon rode over the plain and 
surveyed the locality with a profound air and in silence nodded with approval or shook 
his head dubiously and without communicating to the generals around him the profound course of 
ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final conclusions in the form of 
commands having listened to a suggestion from davout who was now called prince to turn 
the russian left wing napoleon said it should not be done without explaining why not 
to a proposal made by general campan who was to attack the flèches to lead 
his division through the woods napoleon agreed though the so called duke of elchingen ney 
ventured to remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the 
division having inspected the country opposite the shevárdino redoubt napoleon pondered a little in silence 
and then indicated the spots where two batteries should be set up by the morrow 
to act against the russian entrenchments and the places where in line with them the 
field artillery should be placed after giving these and other commands he returned to his 
tent and the dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation these dispositions 
of which the french historians write with enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect were 
as follows at dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain 
occupied by the prince will open fire on the opposing batteries of the enemy at 
the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st corps general pernetti with 
thirty cannon of division and all the howitzers of and divisions will move forward open 
fire and overwhelm with shellfire the battery against which will operate 24 guns of the 
artillery of the guards 30 guns of division and 8 guns of and divisions in 
all 62 guns the commander of the artillery of the 3rd corps general fouché will 
place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th corps sixteen in all on the flanks 
of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left which will have 
forty guns in all directed against it general sorbier must be ready at the first 
order to advance with all the howitzers of the artillery against either one or other 
of the entrenchments during the cannonade prince poniatowski is to advance through the wood on 
the village and turn the position general campan will move through the wood to seize 
the first fortification after the advance has begun in this manner orders will be given 
in accordance with the movements the cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon 
as the guns of the right wing are heard the sharpshooters of division and of 
the vice division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack commence on the 
right wing the vice king will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges 
advancing to the same heights as and divisions which under his leadership will be directed 
against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces all this 
must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordre et méthode as 
far as possible retaining troops in reserve the imperial camp near mozháysk september 6 1812 
these dispositions which are very obscure and confused if one allows oneself to regard the 
arrangements without religious awe of his genius related to orders to deal with four different 
orders not one of these was or could be carried out in the disposition it 
is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by napoleon with the 
guns of pernetti and fouché which were to come in line with them 102 guns 
in all were to open fire and shower shells on the russian flèches and redoubts 
this could not be done as from the spots selected by napoleon the projectiles did 
not carry to the russian works and those 102 guns shot into the air until 
the nearest commander contrary to instructions moved them forward the second order was that poniatowski 
moving to the village through the wood should turn the russian left flank this could 
not be done and was not done because poniatowski advancing on the village through the 
wood met túchkov there barring his way and could not and did not turn the 
russian position the third order was general campan will move through the wood to seize 
the first fortification general division did not seize the first fortification but was driven back 
for on emerging from the wood it had to reform under grapeshot of which napoleon 
was unaware the fourth order was the vice king will occupy the village borodinó and 
cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights as and divisions for whose 
movements no directions are given which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt 
and come into line with the rest of the forces as far as one can 
make out not so much from this unintelligible sentence as from the attempts the vice 
king made to execute the orders given him he was to advance from the left 
through borodinó to the redoubt while the divisions of morand and gérard were to advance 
simultaneously from the front all this like the other parts of the disposition was not 
and could not be executed after passing through borodinó the vice king was driven back 
to the kolochá and could get no farther while the divisions of morand and gérard 
did not take the redoubt but were driven back and the redoubt was only taken 
at the end of the battle by the cavalry a thing probably unforeseen and not 
heard of by napoleon so not one of the orders in the disposition was or 
could be executed but in the disposition it is said that after the fight has 
commenced in this manner orders will be given in accordance with the movements and so 
it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be made by napoleon during the 
battle but this was not and could not be done for during the whole battle 
napoleon was so far away that as appeared later he could not know the course 
of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed 
chapter xxviii many historians say that the french did not win the battle of borodinó 
because napoleon had a cold and that if he had not had a cold the 
orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of 
genius and russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been 
changed to historians who believe that russia was shaped by the will of one the 
that france from a republic became an empire and french armies went to russia at 
the will of one say that russia remained a power because napoleon had a bad 
cold on the twenty fourth of august may seem logical and convincing if it had 
depended on will to fight or not to fight the battle of borodinó and if 
this or that other arrangement depended on his will then evidently a cold affecting the 
manifestation of his will might have saved russia and consequently the valet who omitted to 
bring napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty fourth would have been the savior of 
russia along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable as indubitable as the 
deduction voltaire made in jest without knowing what he was jesting at when he saw 
that the massacre of st bartholomew was due to charles stomach being deranged but to 
men who do not admit that russia was formed by the will of one man 
peter i or that the french empire was formed and the war with russia begun 
by the will of one man napoleon that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational 
but contrary to all human reality to the question of what causes historic events another 
answer presents itself namely that the course of human events is predetermined from on on 
the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the events and that 
a influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious strange as 
at first glance it may seem to suppose that the massacre of st bartholomew was 
not due to charles will though he gave the order for it and thought it 
was done as a result of that order and strange as it may seem to 
suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand men at borodinó was not due to will 
though he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done 
because he ordered it strange as these suppositions appear yet human tells me that each 
of us is if not more at least not less a man than the great 
the acceptance of that solution of the question and historic investigation abundantly confirms it at 
the battle of borodinó napoleon shot at no one and killed no one that was 
all done by the soldiers therefore it was not he who killed people the french 
soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of borodinó not because of 
orders but by their own volition the whole italian german polish and ragged and weary 
of the campaign felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to moscow 
that the wine was drawn and must be drunk had napoleon then forbidden them to 
fight the russians they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the russians 
because it was inevitable when they heard proclamation offering them as compensation for mutilation and 
death the words of posterity about their having been in the battle before moscow they 
cried just as they had cried at the sight of the portrait of the boy 
piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick and just as they would have cried 
at any nonsense that might be told them there was nothing left for them to 
do but cry and go to fight in order to get food and rest as 
conquerors in moscow so it was not because of commands that they killed their fellow 
men and it was not napoleon who directed the course of the battle for none 
of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was 
going on before him so the way in which these people killed one another was 
not decided by will but occurred independently of him in accord with the will of 
hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common action it only seemed 
to napoleon that it all took place by his will and so the question whether 
he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than the cold 
of the least of the transport soldiers moreover the assertion made by various writers that 
his cold was the cause of his dispositions not being as well planned as on 
former occasions and of his orders during the battle not being as good as previously 
is quite baseless which again shows that cold on the twenty sixth of august was 
unimportant the dispositions cited above are not at all worse but are even better than 
previous dispositions by which he had won victories his pseudo orders during the battle were 
also no worse than formerly but much the same as usual these dispositions and orders 
only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of borodinó was the first napoleon 
did not win the profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad and 
every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance when they relate to a battle 
that has been lost and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good and 
serious people fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits when they relate to a battle 
that has been won the dispositions drawn up by weyrother for the battle of austerlitz 
were a model of perfection for that kind of composition but still they were for 
their very perfection for their excessive minuteness napoleon at the battle of borodinó fulfilled his 
office as representative of authority as well as and even better than at other battles 
he did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle he inclined to the most 
reasonable opinions he made no confusion did not contradict himself did not get frightened or 
run away from the field of battle but with his great tact and military experience 
carried out his role of appearing to command calmly and with dignity chapter xxix on 
returning from a second inspection of the lines napoleon remarked chessmen are set up the 
game will begin tomorrow having ordered punch and summoned de beausset he began to talk 
to him about paris and about some changes he meant to make in the household 
surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details relating to the court he showed 
an interest in trifles joked about de love of travel and chatted carelessly as a 
famous self confident surgeon who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and 
putting on his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table matter 
is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head when the time 
comes to set to work i shall do it as no one else could but 
now i can jest and the more i jest and the calmer i am the 
more tranquil and confident you ought to be and the more amazed at my genius 
having finished his second glass of punch napoleon went to rest before the serious business 
which he considered awaited him next day he was so much interested in that task 
that he was unable to sleep and in spite of his cold which had grown 
worse from the dampness of the evening he went into the large division of the 
tent at three in the morning loudly blowing his nose he asked whether the russians 
had not withdrawn and was told that the fires were still in the same places 
he nodded approval the adjutant in attendance came into the tent rapp do you think 
we shall do good business today napoleon asked him doubt sire replied rapp napoleon looked 
at him you remember sire what you did me the honor to say at smolénsk 
continued rapp wine is drawn and must be drunk napoleon frowned and sat silent for 
a long time leaning his head on his hand poor army he suddenly remarked has 
diminished greatly since smolénsk fortune is frankly a courtesan rapp i have always said so 
and i am beginning to experience it but the guards rapp the guards are intact 
he remarked interrogatively sire replied rapp napoleon took a lozenge put it in his mouth 
and glanced at his watch he was not sleepy and it was still not nearly 
morning it was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time for 
the orders had all been given and were now being executed the biscuits and rice 
been served out to the regiments of the guards asked napoleon sternly sire rice too 
rapp replied that he had given the order about the rice but napoleon shook his 
head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his order had been executed an attendant 
came in with punch napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for rapp and silently 
sipped his own have neither taste nor smell he remarked sniffing at his glass cold 
is tiresome they talk about is the good of medicine when it cure a cold 
corvisart gave me these lozenges but they help at all what can doctors cure one 
cure anything our body is a machine for living it is organized for that it 
is its nature let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself 
it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies our 
body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time the watchmaker 
cannot open it he can only adjust it by fumbling and that blindfold yes our 
body is just a machine for living that is all and having entered on the 
path of definition of which he was fond napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new 
one you know rapp what military art is asked he is the art of being 
stronger than the enemy at a given moment all rapp made no reply we shall 
have to deal with kutúzov said napoleon shall see do you remember at braunau he 
commanded an army for three weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect 
his entrenchments we shall see he looked at his watch it was still only four 
he did not feel sleepy the punch was finished and there was still nothing to 
do he rose walked to and fro put on a warm overcoat and a hat 
and went out of the tent the night was dark and damp a scarcely perceptible 
moisture was descending from above near by the campfires were dimly burning among the french 
guards and in the distance those of the russian line shone through the smoke the 
weather was calm and the rustle and tramp of the french troops already beginning to 
move to take up their positions were clearly audible napoleon walked about in front of 
his tent looked at the fires and listened to these sounds and as he was 
passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy cap who was standing sentinel before his tent 
and had drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the emperor napoleon 
stopped in front of him year did you enter the service he asked with that 
affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the soldiers the man 
answered the question one of the old ones has your regiment had its rice has 
your majesty napoleon nodded and walked away at half past five napoleon rode to the 
village of shevárdino it was growing light the sky was clearing only a single cloud 
lay in the east the abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint morning 
light on the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away 
in the prevailing silence some minutes passed a second and a third report shook the 
air then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right the 
first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out and yet more 
were heard mingling with and overtaking one another napoleon with his suite rode up to 
the shevárdino redoubt where he dismounted the game had begun chapter xxx on returning to 
górki after having seen prince andrew pierre ordered his groom to get the horses ready 
and to call him early in the morning and then immediately fell asleep behind a 
partition in a corner borís had given up to him before he was thoroughly awake 
next morning everybody had already left the hut the panes were rattling in the little 
windows and his groom was shaking him excellency your excellency your excellency he kept repeating 
pertinaciously while he shook pierre by the shoulder without looking at him having apparently lost 
hope of getting him to wake up has it begun is it time pierre asked 
waking up the firing said the groom a discharged soldier the gentlemen have gone out 
and his serene highness himself rode past long ago pierre dressed hastily and ran out 
to the porch outside all was bright fresh dewy and cheerful the sun just bursting 
forth from behind a cloud that had concealed it was shining with rays still half 
broken by the clouds over the roofs of the street opposite on the dew besprinkled 
dust of the road on the walls of the houses on the windows the fence 
and on horses standing before the hut the roar of guns sounded more distinct outside 
an adjutant accompanied by a cossack passed by at a sharp trot time count time 
cried the adjutant telling the groom to follow him with the horses pierre went down 
the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle 
the day before a crowd of military men was assembled there members of the staff 
could be heard conversing in french and gray head in a white cap with a 
red band was visible his gray nape sunk between his shoulders he was looking through 
a field glass down the highroad before him mounting the steps to the knoll pierre 
looked at the scene before him spellbound by beauty it was the same panorama he 
had admired from that spot the day before but now the whole place was full 
of troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns and the slanting rays of 
the bright sun rising slightly to the left behind pierre cast upon it through the 
clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy golden tinted light and long dark shadows the 
forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of 
a yellowish green color its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced 
beyond valúevo by the smolénsk highroad crowded with troops nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields 
interspersed with copses there were troops to be seen everywhere in front and to the 
right and left all this was vivid majestic and unexpected but what impressed pierre most 
of all was the view of the battlefield itself of borodinó and the hollows on 
both sides of the kolochá above the kolochá in borodinó and on both sides of 
it especially to the left where the vóyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into 
the kolochá a mist had spread which seemed to melt to dissolve and to become 
translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored and outlined everything the smoke of 
the guns mingled with this mist and over the whole expanse and through that mist 
the rays of the morning sun were reflected flashing back like lightning from the water 
from the dew and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks 
and in borodinó a white church could be seen through the mist and here and 
there the roofs of huts in borodinó as well as dense masses of soldiers or 
green ammunition chests and ordnance and all this moved or seemed to move as the 
smoke and mist spread out over the whole space just as in the mist enveloped 
hollow near borodinó so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in 
the woods and fields to the left in the valleys and on the summits of 
the high ground clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing 
now singly now several at a time some translucent others dense which swelling growing rolling 
and blending extended over the whole expanse these puffs of smoke and strange to say 
the sound of the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle a round compact 
cloud of smoke was seen merging from violet into gray and milky white and came 
the report a second later puff two clouds arose pushing one another and blending together 
and boom came the sounds confirming what the eye had seen pierre glanced round at 
the first cloud which he had seen as a round compact ball and in its 
place already were balloons of smoke floating to one side with a pause puff three 
and then four more appeared and then from each with the same boom came the 
fine firm precise sounds in reply it seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran 
and sometimes stood still while woods fields and glittering bayonets ran past them from the 
left over fields and bushes those large balls of smoke were continually appearing followed by 
their solemn reports while nearer still in the hollows and woods there burst from the 
muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls but had their little echoes 
in just the same way ta ta takh came the frequent crackle of musketry but 
it was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon pierre wished 
to be there with that smoke those shining bayonets that movement and those sounds he 
turned to look at kutúzov and his suite to compare his impressions with those of 
others they were all looking at the field of battle as he was and as 
it seemed to him with the same feelings all their faces were now shining with 
that latent warmth of feeling pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood 
after his talk with prince andrew my dear fellow go and christ be with you 
kutúzov was saying to a general who stood beside him not taking his eye from 
the battlefield having received this order the general passed by pierre on his way down 
the knoll the crossing said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of 
the staff who asked where he was going go there too i too thought pierre 
and followed the general the general mounted a horse a cossack had brought him pierre 
went to his groom who was holding his horses and asking which was the quietest 
clambered onto it seized it by the mane and turning out his toes pressed his 
heels against its sides and feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable to 
let go of the mane and reins he galloped after the general causing the staff 
officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll chapter xxxi having descended the 
hill the general after whom pierre was galloping turned sharply to the left and pierre 
losing sight of him galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him 
he tried to pass either in front of them or to the right or left 
but there were soldiers everywhere all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with some 
unseen but evidently important task they all gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression 
at this stout man in a white hat who for some unknown reason threatened to 
trample them under his hoofs ride into the middle of the battalion one of them 
shouted at him another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket and 
pierre bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse galloped ahead 
of the soldiers where there was a free space there was a bridge ahead of 
him where other soldiers stood firing pierre rode up to them without being aware of 
it he had come to the bridge across the kolochá between górki and borodinó which 
the french having occupied borodinó were attacking in the first phase of the battle pierre 
saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing 
something on both sides of it and in the meadow among the rows of new 
mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires 
the day before but despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea 
that this was the field of battle he did not notice the sound of the 
bullets whistling from every side or the projectiles that flew over him did not see 
the enemy on the other side of the river and for a long time did 
not notice the killed and wounded though many fell near him he looked about him 
with a smile which did not leave his face that fellow in front of the 
line shouted somebody at him again the left keep to the right the men shouted 
to him pierre went to the right and unexpectedly encountered one of adjutants whom he 
knew the adjutant looked angrily at him evidently also intending to shout at him but 
on recognizing him he nodded have you got here he said and galloped on pierre 
feeling out of place there having nothing to do and afraid of getting in way 
again galloped after the adjutant happening here may i come with you he asked moment 
one moment replied the adjutant and riding up to a stout colonel who was standing 
in the meadow he gave him some message and then addressed pierre have you come 
here count he asked with a smile inquisitive yes assented pierre but the adjutant turned 
his horse about and rode on tolerable said he with bagratión on the left flank 
getting it frightfully hot said pierre is that along with me to our knoll we 
can get a view from there and in our battery it is still bearable said 
the adjutant you come come with you replied pierre looking round for his groom it 
was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being carried on stretchers 
on that very meadow he had ridden over the day before a soldier was lying 
athwart the rows of scented hay with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako 
off they carried him away pierre was about to ask but seeing the stern expression 
of the adjutant who was also looking that way he checked himself pierre did not 
find his groom and rode along the hollow with the adjutant to redoubt his horse 
lagged behind the and jolted him at every step seem to be used to riding 
count remarked the adjutant not that but her action seems so jerky said pierre in 
a puzzled tone wounded said the adjutant the off foreleg above the knee a bullet 
no doubt i congratulate you count on your baptism of fire having ridden in the 
smoke past the sixth corps behind the artillery which had been moved forward and was 
in action deafening them with the noise of firing they came to a small wood 
there it was cool and quiet with a scent of autumn pierre and the adjutant 
dismounted and walked up the hill on foot the general here asked the adjutant on 
reaching the knoll was here a minute ago but has just gone that way someone 
told him pointing to the right the adjutant looked at pierre as if puzzled what 
to do with him now trouble about me said pierre go up onto the knoll 
if i may do see everything from there and less dangerous and come for you 
pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on they did not meet again 
and only much later did pierre learn that he lost an arm that day the 
knoll to which pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known to the russians as 
the knoll battery or redoubt and to the french as la grande redoute la fatale 
redoute la redoute du centre around which tens of thousands fell and which the french 
regarded as the key to the whole position this redoubt consisted of a knoll on 
three sides of which trenches had been dug within the entrenchment stood ten guns that 
were being fired through openings in the earthwork in line with the knoll on both 
sides stood other guns which also fired incessantly a little behind the guns stood infantry 
when ascending that knoll pierre had no notion that this spot on which small trenches 
had been dug and from which a few guns were firing was the most important 
point of the battle on the contrary just because he happened to be there he 
thought it one of the least significant parts of the field having reached the knoll 
pierre sat down at one end of a trench surrounding the battery and gazed at 
what was going on around him with an unconsciously happy smile occasionally he rose and 
walked about the battery still with that same smile trying not to obstruct the soldiers 
who were loading hauling the guns and continually running past him with bags and charges 
the guns of that battery were being fired continually one after another with a deafening 
roar enveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke in contrast with the dread felt by 
the infantrymen placed in support here in the battery where a small number of men 
busy at their work were separated from the rest by a trench everyone experienced a 
common and as it were family feeling of animation the intrusion of nonmilitary figure in 
a white hat made an unpleasant impression at first the soldiers looked askance at him 
with surprise and even alarm as they went past him the senior artillery officer a 
tall long legged pockmarked man moved over to pierre as if to see the action 
of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity a young round faced officer 
quite a boy still and evidently only just out of the cadet college who was 
zealously commanding the two guns entrusted to him addressed pierre sternly he said me to 
ask you to stand aside you must not be here the soldiers shook their heads 
disapprovingly as they looked at pierre but when they had convinced themselves that this man 
in the white hat was doing no harm but either sat quietly on the slope 
of the trench with a shy smile or politely making way for the soldiers paced 
up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a 
boulevard their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering 
sympathy such as soldiers feel for their dogs cocks goats and in general for the 
animals that live with the regiment the men soon accepted pierre into their family adopted 
him gave him a nickname and made kindly fun of him among themselves a shell 
tore up the earth two paces from pierre and he looked around with a smile 
as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up it not afraid 
sir really now a red faced broad shouldered soldier asked pierre with a grin that 
disclosed a set of sound white teeth you afraid then said pierre else do you 
expect answered the soldier has no mercy you know when she comes spluttering down out 
go your innards one help being afraid he said laughing several of the men with 
bright kindly faces stopped beside pierre they seemed not to have expected him to talk 
like anybody else and the discovery that he did so delighted them the business of 
us soldiers but in a gentleman wonderful a gentleman for you your places cried the 
young officer to the men gathered round pierre the young officer was evidently exercising his 
duties for the first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the 
men with great precision and formality the booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were 
growing more intense over the whole field especially to the left where flèches were but 
where pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost impossible to distinguish anything 
moreover his whole attention was engrossed by watching the family from all by the men 
in the battery his first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and 
sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by another especially since he had seen that 
soldier lying alone in the hayfield now seated on the slope of the trench he 
observed the faces of those around him by ten some twenty men had already been 
carried away from the battery two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and 
more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around but the men 
in the battery seemed not to notice this and merry voices and jokes were heard 
on all sides live one shouted a man as a whistling shell approached this way 
to the infantry added another with loud laughter seeing the shell fly past and fall 
into the ranks of the supports you bowing to a friend eh remarked another chaffing 
a peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over several soldiers gathered by 
the wall of the trench looking out to see what was happening in front withdrawn 
the front line it has retired said they pointing over the earthwork your own business 
an old sergeant shouted at them retired because work for them to do farther back 
and the sergeant taking one of the men by the shoulders gave him a shove 
with his knee this was followed by a burst of laughter the fifth gun wheel 
it up came shouts from one side then all together like bargees rose the merry 
voices of those who were moving the gun she nearly knocked our hat off cried 
the red faced humorist showing his teeth chaffing pierre baggage he added reproachfully to a 
cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a leg then you foxes said another 
laughing at some militiamen who stooping low entered the battery to carry away the wounded 
man this gruel to your taste oh you crows scared they shouted at the militiamen 
who stood hesitating before the man whose leg had been torn off lads oh oh 
they mimicked the peasants like it at all pierre noticed that after every ball that 
hit the redoubt and after every loss the liveliness increased more and more as the 
flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and rapidly from an 
approaching thundercloud so as if in opposition to what was taking place the lightning of 
hidden fire growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these men pierre 
did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know what was 
happening there he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire which burned ever more brightly 
and which he felt was flaming up in the same way in his own soul 
at ten the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of the battery 
and along the kámenka streamlet retreated from the battery they could be seen running back 
past it carrying their wounded on their muskets a general with his suite came to 
the battery and after speaking to the colonel gave pierre an angry look and went 
away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down so as 
to be less exposed to fire after this from amid the ranks of infantry to 
the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of command 
and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry moved forward pierre looked 
over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck by a pale young officer 
who letting his sword hang down was walking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around the 
ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their long drawn shout and rapid 
musketry firing could still be heard a few minutes later crowds of wounded men and 
stretcher bearers came back from that direction projectiles began to fall still more frequently in 
the battery several men were lying about who had not been removed around the cannon 
the men moved still more briskly and busily no one any longer took notice of 
pierre once or twice he was shouted at for being in the way the senior 
officer moved with big rapid strides from one gun to another with a frowning face 
the young officer with his face still more flushed commanded the men more scrupulously than 
ever the soldiers handed up the charges turned loaded and did their business with strained 
smartness they gave little jumps as they walked as though they were on springs the 
stormcloud had come upon them and in every face the fire which pierre had watched 
kindle burned up brightly pierre standing beside the commanding officer the young officer his hand 
to his shako ran up to his superior have the honor to report sir that 
only eight rounds are left are we to continue firing he asked the senior shouted 
without answering the question looking over the wall of the trench suddenly something happened the 
young officer gave a gasp and bending double sat down on the ground like a 
bird shot on the wing everything became strange confused and misty in eyes one cannon 
ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork a soldier or a gun pierre 
who had not noticed these sounds before now heard nothing else on the right of 
the battery soldiers shouting were running not forwards but backwards it seemed to pierre a 
cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing 
crumbling down the earth a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same 
instant plumped into something some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back with grapeshot 
shouted the officer the sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper 
informed him as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more 
of some wine asked for that there were no more charges scoundrels what are they 
doing shouted the officer turning to pierre the face was red and perspiring and his 
eyes glittered under his frowning brow to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes 
he yelled angrily avoiding pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men go said 
pierre the officer without answering him strode across to the opposite side fire wait he 
shouted the man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against pierre sir 
this is no place for you said he and ran down the slope pierre ran 
after him avoiding the spot where the young officer was sitting one cannon ball another 
and a third flew over him falling in front beside and behind him pierre ran 
down the slope am i going he suddenly asked himself when he was already near 
the green ammunition wagons he halted irresolutely not knowing whether to return or go on 
suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground at the same instant he 
was dazzled by a great flash of flame and immediately a deafening roar crackling and 
whistling made his ears tingle when he came to himself he was sitting on the 
ground leaning on his hands the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed 
only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass and a horse dangling fragments 
of its shaft behind it galloped past while another horse lay like pierre on the 
ground uttering prolonged and piercing cries chapter xxxii beside himself with terror pierre jumped up 
and ran back to the battery as to the only refuge from the horrors that 
surrounded him on entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something there 
but that no shots were being fired from the battery he had no time to 
realize who these men were he saw the senior officer lying on the earth wall 
with his back turned as if he were examining something down below and that one 
of the soldiers he had noticed before was struggling forward shouting and trying to free 
himself from some men who were holding him by the arm he also saw something 
else that was strange but he had not time to realize that the colonel had 
been killed that the soldier shouting was a prisoner and that another man had been 
bayoneted in the back before his eyes for hardly had he run into the redoubt 
before a thin sallow faced perspiring man in a blue uniform rushed on him sword 
in hand shouting something instinctively guarding against the they had been running together at full 
speed before they saw one put out his hands and seized the man a french 
officer by the shoulder with one hand and by the throat with the other the 
officer dropping his sword seized pierre by his collar for some seconds they gazed with 
frightened eyes at one unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done 
and what they were to do next i taken prisoner or have i taken him 
prisoner each was thinking but the french officer was evidently more inclined to think he 
had been taken prisoner because strong hand impelled by instinctive fear squeezed his throat ever 
tighter and tighter the frenchman was about to say something when just above their heads 
terrible and low a cannon ball whistled and it seemed to pierre that the french 
head had been torn off so swiftly had he ducked it pierre too bent his 
head and let his hands fall without further thought as to who had taken whom 
prisoner the frenchman ran back to the battery and pierre ran down the slope stumbling 
over the dead and wounded who it seemed to him caught at his feet but 
before he reached the foot of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd 
of russian soldiers who stumbling tripping up and shouting ran merrily and wildly toward the 
battery this was the attack for which ermólov claimed the credit declaring that only his 
courage and good luck made such a feat possible it was the attack in which 
he was said to have thrown some st crosses he had in his pocket into 
the battery for the first soldiers to take who got there the french who had 
occupied the battery fled and our troops shouting pursued them so far beyond the battery 
that it was difficult to call them back the prisoners were brought down from the 
battery and among them was a wounded french general whom the officers surrounded crowds of 
known to pierre and some and french with faces distorted by suffering walked crawled and 
were carried on stretchers from the battery pierre again went up onto the knoll where 
he had spent over an hour and of that family circle which had received him 
as a member he did not find a single one there were many dead whom 
he did not know but some he recognized the young officer still sat in the 
same way bent double in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth 
wall the red faced man was still twitching but they did not carry him away 
pierre ran down the slope once more they will stop it now they will be 
horrified at what they have done he thought aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher 
bearers moving from the battlefield but behind the veil of smoke the sun was still 
high and in front and especially to the left near semënovsk something seemed to be 
seething in the smoke and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish but 
even increased to desperation like a man who straining himself shrieks with all his remaining 
strength chapter xxxiii the chief action of the battle of borodinó was fought within the 
seven thousand feet between borodinó and flèches beyond that space there was on the one 
side a demonstration made by the russians with cavalry at midday and on the other 
side beyond utítsa collision with túchkov but these two were detached and feeble actions in 
comparison with what took place in the center of the battlefield on the field between 
borodinó and the flèches beside the wood the chief action of the day took place 
on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and 
most artless way the battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred 
guns then when the whole field was covered with smoke two divisions and advanced from 
the french right while troops advanced on borodinó from their left from the shevárdino redoubt 
where napoleon was standing the flèches were two thirds of a mile away and it 
was more than a mile as the crow flies to borodinó so that napoleon could 
not see what was happening there especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid 
the whole locality the soldiers of division advancing against the flèches could only be seen 
till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the flèches as soon 
as they had descended into that hollow the smoke of the guns and musketry on 
the flèches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that side of 
it through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something at times the glint of 
bayonets but whether they were moving or stationary whether they were french or russian could 
not be discovered from the shevárdino redoubt the sun had risen brightly and its slanting 
rays struck straight into face as shading his eyes with his hand he looked at 
the flèches the smoke spread out before them and at times it looked as if 
the smoke were moving at times as if the troops moved sometimes shouts were heard 
through the firing but it was impossible to tell what was being done there napoleon 
standing on the knoll looked through a field glass and in its small circlet saw 
smoke and men sometimes his own and sometimes russians but when he looked again with 
the naked eye he could not tell where what he had seen was he descended 
the knoll and began walking up and down before it occasionally he stopped listened to 
the firing and gazed intently at the battlefield but not only was it impossible to 
make out what was happening from where he was standing down below or from the 
knoll above on which some of his generals had taken their stand but even from 
the flèches which by this time there were now russian and now french soldiers alternately 
or together dead wounded alive frightened or at those flèches themselves it was impossible to 
make out what was taking place there for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketry 
fire now russians were seen alone now frenchmen alone now infantry and now cavalry they 
appeared fired fell collided not knowing what to do with one another screamed and ran 
back again from the battlefield adjutants he had sent out and orderlies from his marshals 
kept galloping up to napoleon with reports of the progress of the action but all 
these reports were false both because it was impossible in the heat of battle to 
say what was happening at any given moment and because many of the adjutants did 
not go to the actual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from 
others and also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to napoleon 
circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming false thus an adjutant galloped 
up from murat with tidings that borodinó had been occupied and the bridge over the 
kolochá was in the hands of the french the adjutant asked whether napoleon wished the 
troops to cross it napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up on the 
farther side and wait but before that order was as soon in fact as the 
adjutant had left bridge had been retaken by the russians and burned in the very 
skirmish at which pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle an adjutant 
galloped up from the flèches with a pale and frightened face and reported to napoleon 
that their attack had been repulsed campan wounded and davout killed yet at the very 
time the adjutant had been told that the french had been repulsed the flèches had 
in fact been recaptured by other french troops and davout was alive and only slightly 
bruised on the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy reports napoleon gave his orders which had 
either been executed before he gave them or could not be and were not executed 
the marshals and generals who were nearer to the field of battle but like napoleon 
did not take part in the actual fighting and only occasionally went within musket range 
made their own arrangements without asking napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction 
to fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run but even their orders 
like were seldom carried out and then but partially for the most part things happened 
contrary to their orders soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot soldiers ordered 
to remain where they were suddenly seeing russians unexpectedly before them sometimes rushed back and 
sometimes forward and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying russians in 
this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the semënovsk hollow and as soon as they 
reached the top of the incline turned round and galloped full speed back again the 
infantry moved in the same way sometimes running to quite other places than those they 
were ordered to go to all orders as to where and when to move the 
guns when to send infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the russian such 
orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the units concerned without 
asking either ney davout or murat much less napoleon they did not fear getting into 
trouble for not fulfilling orders or for acting on their own initiative for in battle 
what is at stake is what is dearest to own it sometimes seems that safety 
lies in running back sometimes in running forward and these men who were right in 
the heat of the battle acted according to the mood of the moment in reality 
however all these movements forward and backward did not improve or alter the position of 
the troops all their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm the harm 
of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over the 
fields on which these men were floundering about as soon as they left the place 
where the balls and bullets were flying about their superiors located in the background re 
formed them and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led 
them back to the zone of fire where under the influence of fear of death 
they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance promptings of the throng 
chapter xxxiv ney and murat who were near that region of fire and sometimes even 
entered led into it huge masses of well ordered troops but contrary to what had 
always happened in their former battles instead of the news they expected of the flight 
these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs the generals re formed them 
but their numbers constantly decreased in the middle of the day murat sent his adjutant 
to napoleon to demand reinforcements napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll drinking punch 
when adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the russians would be routed if his 
majesty would let him have another division said napoleon in a tone of stern surprise 
looking at the handsome lad with long black curls arranged like though he did not 
understand his words thought napoleon to himself can they need reinforcements when they already have 
half the army directed against a weak unentrenched russian wing the king of naples said 
he sternly it is not noon yet and i yet see my chessboard clearly go 
the handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without removing his hand from 
his hat and galloped back to where men were being slaughtered napoleon rose and having 
summoned caulaincourt and berthier began talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle in 
the midst of this conversation which was beginning to interest napoleon eyes turned to look 
at a general with a suite who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering 
horse it was belliard having dismounted he went up to the emperor with rapid strides 
and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending reinforcements he swore 
on his honor that the russians were lost if the emperor would give another division 
napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down without replying belliard began 
talking loudly and eagerly to the generals of the suite around him are very fiery 
belliard said napoleon when he again came up to the general the heat of a 
battle it is easy to make a mistake go and have another look and then 
come back to me before belliard was out of sight a messenger from another part 
of the battlefield galloped up then what do you want asked napoleon in the tone 
of a man irritated at being continually disturbed the prince began the adjutant for reinforcements 
said napoleon with an angry gesture the adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to 
report but the emperor turned from him took a couple of steps stopped came back 
and called berthier must give reserves he said moving his arms slightly apart do you 
think should be sent there he asked of berthier whom he subsequently termed gosling i 
have made an division sire replied berthier who knew all the regiments and battalions by 
heart napoleon nodded assent the adjutant galloped to division and a few minutes later the 
young guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward napoleon gazed silently in that direction he 
suddenly said to berthier send claparède send division though there was no advantage in sending 
division instead of and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping claparède and sending 
friant now the order was carried out exactly napoleon did not notice that in regard 
to his army he was playing the part of a doctor who hinders by his 
role he so justly understood and condemned division disappeared as the others had done into 
the smoke of the battlefield from all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a gallop 
and as if by agreement all said the same thing they all asked for reinforcements 
and all said that the russians were holding their positions and maintaining a hellish fire 
under which the french army was melting away napoleon sat on a campstool wrapped in 
thought m de beausset the man so fond of travel having fasted since morning came 
up to the emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to his majesty hope i 
may now congratulate your majesty on a victory said he napoleon silently shook his head 
in negation assuming the negation to refer only to the victory and not to the 
lunch m de beausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason 
for not having lunch when one can get it away exclaimed napoleon suddenly and morosely 
and turned aside a beatific smile of regret repentance and ecstasy beamed on m de 
face and he glided away to the other generals napoleon was experiencing a feeling of 
depression like that of an ever lucky gambler who after recklessly flinging money about and 
always winning suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the game finds 
that the more he considers his play the more surely he loses his troops were 
the same his generals the same the same preparations had been made the same dispositions 
and the same proclamation courte et énergique he himself was still the same he knew 
that and knew that he was now even more experienced and skillful than before even 
the enemy was the same as at austerlitz and the terrible stroke of his arm 
had supernaturally become impotent all the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success 
the concentration of batteries on one point an attack by reserves to break the line 
and a cavalry attack by men of iron all these methods had already been employed 
yet not only was there no victory but from all sides came the same news 
of generals killed and wounded of reinforcements needed of the impossibility of driving back the 
russians and of disorganization among his own troops formerly after he had given two or 
three orders and uttered a few phrases marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with 
congratulations and happy faces announcing the trophies taken the corps of prisoners bundles of enemy 
eagles and standards cannon and stores and murat had only begged leave to loose the 
cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons so it had been at lodi marengo arcola 
jena austerlitz wagram and so on but now something strange was happening to his troops 
despite news of the capture of the flèches napoleon saw that this was not the 
same not at all the same as what had happened in his former battles he 
saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him experienced 
in the art of war all their faces looked dejected and they all shunned one 
a de beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening but napoleon 
with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a battle not gained 
by the attacking side in eight hours after all efforts had been expended he knew 
that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might the fight balanced 
on such a strained him and his army when he ran his mind over the 
whole of this strange russian campaign in which not one battle had been won and 
in which not a flag or cannon or army corps had been captured in two 
months when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard 
reports of the russians still holding their terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of 
him and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to his mind the 
russians might fall on his left wing might break through his center he himself might 
be killed by a stray cannon ball all this was possible in former battles he 
had only considered the possibilities of success but now innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves and 
he expected them all yes it was like a dream in which a man fancies 
that a ruffian is coming to attack him and raises his arm to strike that 
ruffian a terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him but then feels that his 
arm drops powerless and limp like a rag and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes 
him in his helplessness the news that the russians were attacking the left flank of 
the french army aroused that horror in napoleon he sat silently on a campstool below 
the knoll with head bowed and elbows on his knees berthier approached and suggested that 
they should ride along the line to ascertain the position of affairs what do you 
say asked napoleon tell them to bring me my horse he mounted and rode toward 
semënovsk amid the powder smoke slowly dispersing over the whole space through which napoleon rode 
horses and men were lying in pools of blood singly or in heaps neither napoleon 
nor any of his generals had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain 
in such a small area the roar of guns that had not ceased for ten 
hours wearied the ear and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle as music does 
to tableaux vivants napoleon rode up the high ground at semënovsk and through the smoke 
saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him they were russians 
the russians stood in serried ranks behind semënovsk village and its knoll and their guns 
boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth clouds of smoke it was no longer 
a battle it was a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to 
the french or the russians napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie 
from which berthier had aroused him he could not stop what was going on before 
him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to depend 
on him and from its lack of success this affair for the first time seemed 
to him unnecessary and horrible one of the generals rode up to napoleon and ventured 
to offer to lead the old guard into action ney and berthier standing near napoleon 
exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this senseless offer napoleon bowed his head and remained 
silent a long time eight hundred leagues from france i will not have my guard 
destroyed he said and turning his horse rode back to shevárdino chapter xxxv on the 
rug covered bench where pierre had seen him in the morning sat kutúzov his gray 
head hanging his heavy body relaxed he gave no orders but only assented to or 
dissented from what others suggested yes do that he replied to various proposals yes go 
dear boy and have a look he would say to one or another of those 
about him or better wait he listened to the reports that were brought him and 
gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of him but when listening to the reports 
it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words spoken 
but rather in something the expression of face and tone of voice of those who 
were reporting by long years of military experience he knew and with the wisdom of 
age understood that it is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of 
others struggling with death and he knew that the result of a battle is decided 
not by the orders of a commander in chief nor the place where the troops 
are stationed nor by the number of cannon or of slaughtered men but by that 
intangible force called the spirit of the army and he watched this force and guided 
it in as far as that was in his power general expression was one of 
concentrated quiet attention and his face wore a strained look as if he found it 
difficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body at eleven they brought 
him news that the flèches captured by the french had been retaken but that prince 
bagratión was wounded kutúzov groaned and swayed his head over to prince peter ivánovich and 
find out about it exactly he said to one of his adjutants and then turned 
to the duke of württemberg who was standing behind him your highness please take command 
of the first army soon after the he could possibly have reached adjutant came back 
from him and told kutúzov that the duke asked for more troops kutúzov made a 
grimace and sent an order to dokhtúrov to take over the command of the first 
army and a request to the he said he could not spare at such an 
important return to him when they brought him news that murat had been taken prisoner 
and the staff officers congratulated him kutúzov smiled a little gentlemen said he battle is 
won and there is nothing extraordinary in the capture of murat still it is better 
to wait before we rejoice but he sent an adjutant to take the news round 
the army when scherbínin came galloping from the left flank with news that the french 
had captured the flèches and the village of semënovsk kutúzov guessing by the sounds of 
the battle and by looks that the news was bad rose as if to stretch 
his legs and taking arm led him aside my dear fellow he said to ermólov 
see whether something be done kutúzov was in górki near the center of the russian 
position the attack directed by napoleon against our left flank had been several times repulsed 
in the center the french had not got beyond borodinó and on their left flank 
cavalry had put the french to flight toward three the french attacks ceased on the 
faces of all who came from the field of battle and of those who stood 
around him kutúzov noticed an expression of extreme tension he was satisfied with the success 
exceeding his expectations but the old strength was failing him several times his head dropped 
low as if it were falling and he dozed off dinner was brought him adjutant 
general wolzogen the man who when riding past prince andrew had said war should be 
extended widely and whom bagratión so detested rode up while kutúzov was at dinner wolzogen 
had come from barclay de tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the 
left flank the sagacious barclay de tolly seeing crowds of wounded men running back and 
the disordered rear of the army weighed all the circumstances concluded that the battle was 
lost and sent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news kutúzov 
was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced at wolzogen with eyes 
that brightened under their puckering lids wolzogen nonchalantly stretching his legs approached kutúzov with a 
half contemptuous smile on his lips scarcely touching the peak of his cap he treated 
his serene highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance intended to show that as a highly 
trained military man he left it to russians to make an idol of this useless 
old man but that he knew whom he was dealing with alte as in their 
own set the germans called kutúzov making himself very comfortable thought wolzogen and looking severely 
at the dishes in front of kutúzov he began to report to old the position 
of affairs on the left flank as barclay had ordered him to and as he 
himself had seen and understood it the points of our position are in the hands 
and we cannot dislodge them for lack of troops the men are running away and 
it is impossible to stop them he reported kutúzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished 
gaze on wolzogen as if not understanding what was said to him wolzogen noticing old 
agitation said with a smile have not considered it right to conceal from your serene 
highness what i have seen the troops are in complete disorder have seen you have 
seen kutúzov shouted frowning and rising quickly he went up to wolzogen how dare you 
he shouted choking and making a threatening gesture with his trembling arms dare you sir 
say that to me you know nothing about it tell general barclay from me that 
his information is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known 
to me the commander in chief than to him wolzogen was about to make a 
rejoinder but kutúzov interrupted him enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on 
the right flank if you have seen amiss sir do not allow yourself to say 
what you know be so good as to ride to general barclay and inform him 
of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow said kutúzov sternly all were silent 
and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of the panting old general are 
repulsed everywhere for which i thank god and our brave army the enemy is beaten 
and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred soil of russia said kutúzov crossing 
himself and he suddenly sobbed as his eyes filled with tears wolzogen shrugging his shoulders 
and curling his lips stepped silently aside marveling at old conceited stupidity here he is 
my hero said kutúzov to a portly handsome dark haired general who was just ascending 
the knoll this was raévski who had spent the whole day at the most important 
part of the field of borodinó raévski reported that the troops were firmly holding their 
ground and that the french no longer ventured to attack after hearing him kutúzov said 
in french you do not think like some others that we must retreat the contrary 
your highness in indecisive actions it is always the most stubborn who remain victors replied 
raévski in my opinion kutúzov called to his adjutant down and write out the order 
of the day for tomorrow and you he continued addressing another along the line and 
announce that tomorrow we attack while kutúzov was talking to raévski and dictating the order 
of the day wolzogen returned from barclay and said that general barclay wished to have 
written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given kutúzov without looking at wolzogen 
gave directions for the order to be written out which the former commander in chief 
to avoid personal responsibility very judiciously wished to receive and by means of that mysterious 
indefinable bond which maintains throughout an army one and the same temper known as spirit 
of the army and which constitutes the sinew of war words his order for a 
battle next day immediately became known from one end of the army to the other 
it was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the 
farthest links of that chain the tales passing from mouth to mouth at different ends 
of the army did not even resemble what kutúzov had said but the sense of 
his words spread everywhere because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations 
but of a feeling that lay in the commander in soul as in that of 
every russian and on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy and hearing 
from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe the exhausted wavering 
men felt comforted and inspirited chapter xxxvi prince regiment was among the reserves which till 
after one were stationed inactive behind semënovsk under heavy artillery fire toward two the regiment 
having already lost more than two hundred men was moved forward into a trampled oatfield 
in the gap between semënovsk and the knoll battery where thousands of men perished that 
day and on which an intense concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed 
between one and two without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the 
regiment here lost another third of its men from in front and especially from the 
right in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed and out of the mysterious domain of 
smoke that overlay the whole space in front quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling 
shells flew unceasingly at times as if to allow them a respite a quarter of 
an hour passed during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead but sometimes 
several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually 
being dragged away and the wounded carried off with each fresh blow less and less 
chance of life remained for those not yet killed the regiment stood in columns of 
battalion three hundred paces apart but nevertheless the men were always in one and the 
same mood all alike were taciturn and morose talk was rarely heard in the ranks 
and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot and the cry 
of was heard most of the time by their order the men sat on the 
ground one having taken off his shako carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and 
drew them tight again another rubbing some dry clay between his palms polished his bayonet 
another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his bandolier while another smoothed and 
refolded his leg bands and put his boots on again some built little houses of 
the tufts in the plowed ground or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield 
all seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits when men were killed or wounded when rows 
of stretchers went past when some troops retreated and when great masses of the enemy 
came into view through the smoke no one paid any attention to these things but 
when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of our infantry were seen to move 
forward words of approval were heard on all sides but the liveliest attention was attracted 
by occurrences quite apart from and unconnected with the battle it was as if the 
minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday commonplace occurrences a battery of 
artillery was passing in front of the regiment the horse of an ammunition cart put 
its leg over a trace look at the trace horse get her leg out fall 
ah they see it came identical shouts from the ranks all along the regiment another 
time general attention was attracted by a small brown dog coming heaven knows whence which 
trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till 
suddenly a shell fell close by when it yelped tucked its tail between its legs 
and darted aside yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment but such 
distractions lasted only a moment and for eight hours the men had been inactive without 
food in constant fear of death and their pale and gloomy faces grew ever paler 
and gloomier prince andrew pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment paced up and 
down from the border of one patch to another at the edge of the meadow 
beside an oatfield with head bowed and arms behind his back there was nothing for 
him to do and no orders to be given everything went on of itself the 
killed were dragged from the front the wounded carried away and the ranks closed up 
if any soldiers ran to the rear they returned immediately and hastily at first prince 
andrew considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set 
them an example walked about among the ranks but he soon became convinced that this 
was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach them all the powers of 
his soul as of every soldier there were unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of 
the horrors of their situation he walked along the meadow dragging his feet rustling the 
grass and gazing at the dust that covered his boots now he took big strides 
trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the mowers then he 
counted his steps calculating how often he must walk from one strip to another to 
walk a mile then he stripped the flowers from the wormwood that grew along a 
boundary rut rubbed them in his palms and smelled their pungent sweetly bitter scent nothing 
remained of the previous thoughts he thought of nothing he listened with weary ears to 
the ever recurring sounds distinguishing the whistle of flying projectiles from the booming of the 
reports glanced at the tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion and 
waited it comes this one is coming our way again he thought listening to an 
approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke another again it has hit he stopped 
and looked at the ranks it has gone over but this one has hit and 
again he started trying to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces a whizz and 
a thud five paces from him a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and 
disappeared a chill ran down his back again he glanced at the ranks probably many 
had been large crowd had gathered near the second battalion he shouted them not to 
crowd together the adjutant having obeyed this instruction approached prince andrew from the other side 
a battalion commander rode up out came a frightened cry from a soldier and like 
a bird whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground a shell dropped with 
little noise within two steps of prince andrew and close to the battalion horse the 
horse first regardless of whether it was right or wrong to show fear snorted reared 
almost throwing the major and galloped aside the terror infected the men down cried the 
adjutant throwing himself flat on the ground prince andrew hesitated the smoking shell spun like 
a top between him and the prostrate adjutant near a wormwood plant between the field 
and the meadow this be death thought prince andrew looking with a quite new envious 
glance at the grass the wormwood and the streamlet of smoke that curled up from 
the rotating black ball cannot i do not wish to die i love love this 
grass this earth this air he thought this and at the same time remembered that 
people were looking at him shameful sir he said to the adjutant he did not 
finish speaking at one and the same moment came the sound of an explosion a 
whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame a suffocating smell of powder and 
prince andrew started to one side raising his arm and fell on his chest several 
officers ran up to him from the right side of his abdomen blood was welling 
out making a large stain on the grass the militiamen with stretchers who were called 
up stood behind the officers prince andrew lay on his chest with his face in 
the grass breathing heavily and noisily are you waiting for come along the peasants went 
up and took him by his shoulders and legs but he moaned piteously and exchanging 
looks they set him down again him up lift him all the same cried someone 
they again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher god my 
god what is it the stomach that means death my god among the officers were 
heard saying flew a breadth past my ear said the adjutant the peasants adjusting the 
stretcher to their shoulders started hurriedly along the path they had trodden down to the 
dressing station in step ah those peasants shouted an officer seizing by their shoulders and 
checking the peasants who were walking unevenly and jolting the stretcher into step fëdor i 
say fëdor said the foremost peasant right said the one behind joyfully when he had 
got into step excellency eh prince said the trembling voice of timókhin who had run 
up and was looking down on the stretcher prince andrew opened his eyes and looked 
up at the speaker from the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and 
again his eyelids drooped the militiamen carried prince andrew to the dressing station by the 
wood where wagons were stationed the dressing station consisted of three tents with flaps turned 
back pitched at the edge of a birch wood in the wood wagons and horses 
were standing the horses were eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down 
and pecked the grains that fell some crows scenting blood flew among the birch trees 
cawing impatiently around the tents over more than five acres bloodstained men in various garbs 
stood sat or lay around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher bearers with dismal 
and attentive faces whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the 
spot disregarding the orders the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently as 
if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them from 
the tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans occasionally dressers ran out 
to fetch water or to point out those who were to be brought in next 
the wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned sighed wept screamed swore or 
asked for vodka some were delirious prince bearers stepping over the wounded who had not 
yet been bandaged took him as a regimental commander close up to one of the 
tents and there stopped awaiting instructions prince andrew opened his eyes and for a long 
time could not make out what was going on around him he remembered the meadow 
the wormwood the field the whirling black ball and his sudden rush of passionate love 
of life two steps from him leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting 
general attention stood a tall handsome black haired noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head he 
had been wounded in the head and leg by bullets around him eagerly listening to 
his talk a crowd of wounded and stretcher bearers was gathered kicked him out from 
there so that he chucked everything we grabbed the king himself cried he looking around 
him with eyes that glittered with fever only reserves had come up just then lads 
there have been nothing left of him i tell you surely like all the others 
near the speaker prince andrew looked at him with shining eyes and experienced a sense 
of comfort it all the same now thought he what will be there and what 
has there been here why was i so reluctant to part with life there was 
something in this life i did not and do not understand chapter xxxvii one of 
the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron holding a cigar between 
the thumb and little finger of one of his small bloodstained hands so as not 
to smear it he raised his head and looked about him but above the level 
of the wounded men he evidently wanted a little respite after turning his head from 
right to left for some time he sighed and looked down right immediately he replied 
to a dresser who pointed prince andrew out to him and he told them to 
carry him into the tent murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting seems that 
even in the next world only the gentry are to have a chance remarked one 
prince andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been 
cleared and which a dresser was washing down prince andrew could not make out distinctly 
what was in that tent the pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain 
in his thigh stomach and back distracted him all he saw about him merged into 
a general impression of naked bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of 
the low tent as a few weeks previously on that hot august day such bodies 
had filled the dirty pond beside the smolénsk road yes it was the same flesh 
the same chair à canon the sight of which had even then filled him with 
horror as by a presentiment there were three operating tables in the tent two were 
occupied and on the third they placed prince andrew for a little while he was 
left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables on 
the nearest one sat a tartar probably a cossack judging by the uniform thrown down 
beside him four soldiers were holding him and a spectacled doctor was cutting into his 
muscular brown back ooh ooh grunted the tartar and suddenly lifting up his swarthy snub 
nosed face with its high cheekbones and baring his white teeth he began to wriggle 
and twitch his body and utter piercing ringing and prolonged yells on the other table 
round which many people were crowding a tall well fed man lay on his back 
with his head thrown back his curly hair its color and the shape of his 
head seemed strangely familiar to prince andrew several dressers were pressing on his chest to 
hold him down one large white plump leg twitched rapidly all the time with a 
feverish tremor the man was sobbing and choking convulsively two of whom was pale and 
silently doing something to this other gory leg when he had finished with the tartar 
whom they covered with an overcoat the spectacled doctor came up to prince andrew wiping 
his hands he glanced at prince face and quickly turned away him what are you 
waiting for he cried angrily to the dressers his very first remotest recollections of childhood 
came back to prince mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to 
undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him the doctor bent down over the 
wound felt it and sighed deeply then he made a sign to someone and the 
torturing pain in his abdomen caused prince andrew to lose consciousness when he came to 
himself the splintered portions of his thighbone had been extracted the torn flesh cut away 
and the wound bandaged water was being sprinkled on his face as soon as prince 
andrew opened his eyes the doctor bent over kissed him silently on the lips and 
hurried away after the sufferings he had been enduring prince andrew enjoyed a blissful feeling 
such as he had not experienced for a long time all the best and happiest 
moments of his his earliest childhood when he used to be undressed and put to 
bed and when leaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he burying 
his head in the pillow felt happy in the mere consciousness of to his memory 
not merely as something past but as something present the doctors were busily engaged with 
the wounded man the shape of whose head seemed familiar to prince andrew they were 
lifting him up and trying to quiet him it to me oh ooh oh oh 
ooh his frightened moans could be heard subdued by suffering and broken by sobs hearing 
those moans prince andrew wanted to weep whether because he was dying without glory or 
because he was sorry to part with life or because of those memories of a 
childhood that could not return or because he was suffering and others were suffering and 
that man near him was groaning so felt like weeping childlike kindly and almost happy 
tears the wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood and with 
the boot still on oh ooh he sobbed like a woman the doctor who had 
been standing beside him preventing prince andrew from seeing his face moved away god what 
is this why is he here said prince andrew to himself in the miserable sobbing 
enfeebled man whose leg had just been amputated he recognized anatole kurágin men were supporting 
him in their arms and offering him a glass of water but his trembling swollen 
lips could not grasp its rim anatole was sobbing painfully it is he yes that 
man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me thought prince andrew not yet clearly 
grasping what he saw before him is the connection of that man with my childhood 
and life he asked himself without finding an answer and suddenly a new unexpected memory 
from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him he remembered natásha 
as he had seen her for the first time at the ball in 1810 with 
her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture and 
love and tenderness for her stronger and more vivid than ever awoke in his soul 
he now remembered the connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly 
gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes he remembered everything and ecstatic 
pity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart prince andrew could no longer 
restrain himself and wept tender loving tears for his fellow men for himself and for 
his own and their errors love of our brothers for those who love us and 
for those who hate us love of our enemies yes that love which god preached 
on earth and which princess mary taught me and i did not is what made 
me sorry to part with life that is what remained for me had i lived 
but now it is too late i know it chapter xxxviii the terrible spectacle of 
the battlefield covered with dead and wounded together with the heaviness of his head and 
the news that some twenty generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded and 
the consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm produced an unexpected impression on 
napoleon who usually liked to look at the killed and wounded thereby he considered testing 
his strength of mind this day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that strength 
of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his greatness he rode hurriedly from 
the battlefield and returned to the shevárdino knoll where he sat on his campstool his 
sallow face swollen and heavy his eyes dim his nose red and his voice hoarse 
involuntarily listening with downcast eyes to the sounds of firing with painful dejection he awaited 
the end of this action in which he regarded himself as a participant and which 
he was unable to arrest a personal human feeling for a brief moment got the 
better of the artificial phantasm of life he had served so long he felt in 
his own person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield the heaviness 
of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for 
himself at that moment he did not desire moscow or victory or glory what need 
had he for any more glory the one thing he wished for was rest tranquillity 
and freedom but when he had been on the semënovsk heights the artillery commander had 
proposed to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen 
the fire on the russian troops crowded in front of knyazkóvo napoleon had assented and 
had given orders that news should be brought to him of the effect those batteries 
produced an adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns 
had been concentrated on the russians as he had ordered but that they still held 
their ground fire is mowing them down by rows but still they hold on said 
the adjutant want more said napoleon in a hoarse voice asked the adjutant who had 
not heard the remark want more croaked napoleon frowning them have it even before he 
gave that order the thing he did not desire and for which he gave the 
order only because he thought it was expected of him was being done and he 
fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary greatness and a horse walking a treadmill 
thinks it is doing something for submissively fulfilled the cruel sad gloomy and inhuman role 
predestined for him and not for that day and hour alone were the mind and 
conscience darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening lay more 
than on all the others who took part in it never to the end of 
his life could he understand goodness beauty or truth or the significance of his actions 
which were too contrary to goodness and truth too remote from everything human for him 
ever to be able to grasp their meaning he could not disavow his actions belauded 
as they were by half the world and so he had to repudiate truth goodness 
and all humanity not only on that day as he rode over the battlefield strewn 
with men killed and maimed by his will as he believed did he reckon as 
he looked at them how many russians there were for each frenchman and deceiving himself 
find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that there were five russians for every frenchman 
not on that day alone did he write in a letter to paris that battle 
field was superb because fifty thousand corpses lay there but even on the island of 
st helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his leisure 
to an account of the great deeds he had done he wrote the russian war 
should have been the most popular war of modern times it was a war of 
good sense for real interests for the tranquillity and security of all it was purely 
pacific and conservative it was a war for a great cause the end of uncertainties 
and the beginning of security a new horizon and new labors were opening out full 
of well being and prosperity for all the european system was already founded all that 
remained was to organize it satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere i 
too should have had my congress and my holy alliance those ideas were stolen from 
me in that reunion of great sovereigns we should have discussed our interests like one 
family and have rendered account to the peoples as clerk to master europe would in 
this way soon have been in fact but one people and anyone who traveled anywhere 
would have found himself always in the common fatherland i should have demanded the freedom 
of all navigable rivers for everybody that the seas should be common to all and 
that the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards for the sovereigns 
on returning to france to the bosom of the great strong magnificent peaceful and glorious 
fatherland i should have proclaimed her frontiers immutable all future wars purely defensive all aggrandizement 
antinational i should have associated my son in the empire my dictatorship would have been 
finished and his constitutional reign would have begun paris would have been the capital of 
the world and the french the envy of the nations my leisure then and my 
old age would have been devoted in company with the empress and during the royal 
apprenticeship of my son to leisurely visiting with our own horses and like a true 
country couple every corner of the empire receiving complaints redressing wrongs and scattering public buildings 
and benefactions on all sides and everywhere napoleon predestined by providence for the gloomy role 
of executioner of the peoples assured himself that the aim of his actions had been 
the welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by the employment 
of power confer benefactions four hundred thousand who crossed the vistula he wrote further of 
the russian war were austrians prussians saxons poles bavarians württembergers mecklenburgers spaniards italians and neapolitans 
the imperial army strictly speaking was one third composed of dutch belgians men from the 
borders of the rhine piedmontese swiss genevese tuscans romans inhabitants of the thirty second military 
division of bremen of hamburg and so on it included scarcely a hundred and forty 
thousand who spoke french the russian expedition actually cost france less than fifty thousand men 
the russian army in its retreat from vílna to moscow lost in the various battles 
four times more men than the french army the burning of moscow cost the lives 
of a hundred thousand russians who died of cold and want in the woods finally 
in its march from moscow to the oder the russian army also suffered from the 
severity of the season so that by the time it reached vílna it numbered only 
fifty thousand and at kálisch less than eighteen thousand he imagined that the war with 
russia came about by his will and the horrors that occurred did not stagger his 
soul he boldly took the whole responsibility for what happened and his darkened mind found 
justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who perished there were fewer 
frenchmen than hessians and bavarians chapter xxxix several tens of thousands of the slain lay 
in diverse postures and various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the davýdov 
family and to the crown fields and meadows where for hundreds of years the peasants 
of borodinó górki shevárdino and semënovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle at 
the dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space of 
some three acres around crowds of men of various arms wounded and unwounded with frightened 
faces dragged themselves back to mozháysk from the one army and back to valúevo from 
the other other crowds exhausted and hungry went forward led by their officers others held 
their ground and continued to fire over the whole field previously so gaily beautiful with 
the glitter of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun there now spread 
a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood 
clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded on 
the frightened exhausted and hesitating men as if to say men enough cease bethink yourselves 
what are you doing to the men of both sides alike worn out by want 
of food and rest it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to 
slaughter one another all the faces expressed hesitation and the question arose in every soul 
what for whom must i kill and be killed you may go and kill whom 
you please but i want to do so any more by evening this thought had 
ripened in every soul at any moment these men might have been seized with horror 
at what they were doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere 
but though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of 
what they were doing though they would have been glad to leave off some incomprehensible 
mysterious power continued to control them and they still brought up the charges loaded aimed 
and applied the match though only one artilleryman survived out of every three and though 
they stumbled and panted with fatigue perspiring and stained with blood and powder the cannon 
balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides crushing human bodies and that 
terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but at the 
will of him who governs men and worlds continued anyone looking at the disorganized rear 
of the russian army would have said that if only the french made one more 
slight effort it would disappear and anyone looking at the rear of the french army 
would have said that the russians need only make one more slight effort and the 
french would be destroyed but neither the french nor the russians made that effort and 
the flame of battle burned slowly out the russians did not make that effort because 
they were not attacking the french at the beginning of the battle they stood blocking 
the way to moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle 
as at the beginning but even had the aim of the russians been to drive 
the french from their positions they could not have made this last effort for all 
the russian troops had been broken up there was no part of the russian army 
that had not suffered in the battle and though still holding their positions they had 
lost one half of their army the french with the memory of all their former 
victories during fifteen years with the assurance of invincibility with the consciousness that they had 
captured part of the battlefield and had lost only a quarter of their men and 
still had their guards intact twenty thousand strong might easily have made that effort the 
french who had attacked the russian army in order to drive it from its position 
ought to have made that effort for as long as the russians continued to block 
the road to moscow as before the aim of the french had not been attained 
and all their efforts and losses were in vain but the french did not make 
that effort some historians say that napoleon need only have used his old guards who 
were intact and the battle would have been won to speak of what would have 
happened had napoleon sent his guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn 
became spring it could not be napoleon did not give his guards not because he 
did not want to but because it could not be done all the generals officers 
and soldiers of the french army knew it could not be done because the flagging 
spirit of the troops would not permit it it was not napoleon alone who had 
experienced that nightmare feeling of the mighty arm being stricken powerless but all the generals 
and soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not 
after all their experience of previous after one tenth of such efforts the enemy had 
a similar feeling of terror before an enemy who after losing half his men stood 
as threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle the moral force 
of the attacking french army was exhausted not that sort of victory which is defined 
by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks called standards and of the 
ground on which the troops had stood and were standing but a moral victory that 
convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence 
was gained by the russians at borodinó the french invaders like an infuriated animal that 
has in its onslaught received a mortal wound felt that they were perishing but could 
not stop any more than the russian army weaker by one half could help swerving 
by impetus gained the french army was still able to roll forward to moscow but 
there without further effort on the part of the russians it had to perish bleeding 
from the mortal wound it had received at borodinó the direct consequence of the battle 
of borodinó was senseless flight from moscow his retreat along the old smolénsk road the 
destruction of the invading army of five hundred thousand men and the downfall of napoleonic 
france on which at borodinó for the first time the hand of an opponent of 
stronger spirit had been laid book eleven 1812 chapter i absolute continuity of motion is 
not comprehensible to the human mind laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to 
man only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion but at the same 
time a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary division of continuous motion 
into discontinuous elements there is a well known so called sophism of the ancients consisting 
in this that achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following in 
spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise by 
the time achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise the tortoise 
has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him when achilles has covered that 
tenth the tortoise has covered another one hundredth and so on forever this problem seemed 
to the ancients insoluble the absurd answer that achilles could never overtake the tortoise resulted 
from this that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements whereas the motion both of 
achilles and of the tortoise was continuous by adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion 
we only approach a solution of the problem but never reach it only when we 
have admitted the conception of the infinitely small and the resulting geometrical progression with a 
common ratio of one tenth and have found the sum of this progression to infinity 
do we reach a solution of the problem a modern branch of mathematics having achieved 
the art of dealing with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more 
complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble this modern branch of mathematics unknown 
to the ancients when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely 
small and so conforms to the chief condition of motion absolute continuity and thereby corrects 
the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements 
of motion instead of examining continuous motion in seeking the laws of historical movement just 
the same thing happens the movement of humanity arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary 
human wills is continuous to understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim 
of history but to arrive at these laws resulting from the sum of all those 
human wills mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected units the first method of history is to 
take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others though 
there is and can be no beginning to any event for one event always flows 
uninterruptedly from another the second method is to consider the actions of some one king 
or a equivalent to the sum of many individual wills whereas the sum of individual 
wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage historical science in 
its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination 
but however small the units it takes we feel that to take any unit disconnected 
from others or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon or to say that the 
will of many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage is 
in itself false it needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions 
drawn from history it is merely necessary to select some larger or smaller unit as 
the subject of criticism has every right to do seeing that whatever unit history observes 
must always be arbitrarily selected only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation the differential 
of history that is the individual tendencies of men and attaining to the art of 
integrating them that is finding the sum of these infinitesimals can we hope to arrive 
at the laws of history the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in europe 
present an extraordinary movement of millions of people men leave their customary pursuits hasten from 
one side of europe to the other plunder and slaughter one another triumph and are 
plunged in despair and for some years the whole course of life is altered and 
presents an intensive movement which first increases and then slackens what was the cause of 
this movement by what laws was it governed asks the mind of man the historians 
replying to this question lay before us the sayings and doings of a few dozen 
men in a building in the city of paris calling these sayings and doings then 
they give a detailed biography of napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to 
him tell of the influence some of these people had on others and say that 
is why this movement took place and those are its laws but the mind of 
man not only refuses to believe this explanation but plainly says that this method of 
explanation is fallacious because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of 
a stronger the sum of human wills produced the revolution and napoleon and only the 
sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them every time there have been 
conquests there have been conquerors every time there has been a revolution in any state 
there have been great men says history and indeed human reason replies every time conquerors 
appear there have been wars but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the 
wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the 
personal activity of a single man whenever i look at my watch and its hands 
point to ten i hear the bells of the neighboring church but because the bells 
begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten i have no right 
to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the 
hands of the watch whenever i see the movement of a locomotive i hear the 
whistle and see the valves opening and wheels turning but i have no right to 
conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement 
of the engine the peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because 
the oaks are budding and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak 
is budding but though i do not know what causes the cold winds to blow 
when the oak buds unfold i cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding of 
the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind for the force of the 
wind is beyond the influence of the buds i see only a coincidence of occurrences 
such as happens with all the phenomena of life and i see that however much 
and however carefully i observe the hands of the watch and the valves and wheels 
of the engine and the oak i shall not discover the cause of the bells 
ringing the engine moving or of the winds of spring to that i must entirely 
change my point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam of 
the bells and of the wind history must do the same and attempts in this 
direction have already been made to study the laws of history we must completely change 
the subject of our observation must leave aside kings ministers and generals and study the 
common infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved no one can say in 
how far it is possible for man to advance in this way toward an understanding 
of the laws of history but it is evident that only along that path does 
the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie and that as yet not a 
millionth part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as 
has been devoted to describing the actions of various kings commanders and ministers and propounding 
the own reflections concerning these actions chapter ii the forces of a dozen european nations 
burst into russia the russian army and people avoided a collision till smolénsk was reached 
and again from smolénsk to borodinó the french army pushed on to moscow its goal 
its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim just as the velocity of a 
falling body increases as it approaches the earth behind it were seven hundred miles of 
hunger stricken hostile country ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal 
every soldier in army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum 
the more the russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred of the 
enemy flared up and while it retreated the army increased and consolidated at borodinó a 
collision took place neither army was broken up but the russian army retreated immediately after 
the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another having a greater 
momentum and with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum 
rolled on for some distance though the collision had deprived it of all its force 
the russians retreated eighty beyond the french reached moscow and there came to a standstill 
for five weeks after that there was not a single battle the french did not 
move as a bleeding mortally wounded animal licks its wounds they remained inert in moscow 
for five weeks and then suddenly with no fresh reason fled back they made a 
dash for the kalúga road and after a at málo yaroslávets the field of conflict 
again remained theirs without undertaking a single serious battle they fled still more rapidly back 
to smolénsk beyond smolénsk beyond the berëzina beyond vílna and farther still on the evening 
of the twenty sixth of august kutúzov and the whole russian army were convinced that 
the battle of borodinó was a victory kutúzov reported so to the emperor he gave 
orders to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not 
to deceive anyone but because he knew that the enemy was beaten as everyone who 
had taken part in the battle knew it but all that evening and next day 
reports came in one after another of unheard of losses of the loss of half 
the army and a fresh battle proved physically impossible it was impossible to give battle 
before information had been collected the wounded gathered in the supplies of ammunition replenished the 
slain reckoned up new officers appointed to replace those who had been killed and before 
the men had had food and sleep and meanwhile the very next morning after the 
battle the french army advanced of itself upon the russians carried forward by the force 
of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the 
distance from its aim wish was to attack next day and the whole army desired 
to do so but to make an attack the wish to do so is not 
sufficient there must also be a possibility of doing it and that possibility did not 
exist it was impossible not to retreat a march and then in the same way 
it was impossible not to retreat another and a third march and at last on 
the first of september when the army drew near the strength of the feeling that 
had arisen in all force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond moscow and the 
troops retired one more last march and abandoned moscow to the enemy for people accustomed 
to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by anyone of us sitting 
over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in 
this or that questions present themselves why did kutúzov during the retreat not do this 
or that why did he not take up a position before reaching filí why did 
he not retire at once by the kalúga road abandoning moscow and so on people 
accustomed to think in that way forget or do not know the inevitable conditions which 
always limit the activities of any commander in chief the activity of a commander in 
chief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit 
at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map with a certain number 
of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality and begin our 
plans from some given moment a commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning 
of any position from which we always contemplate it the commander in chief is always 
in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at 
any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring moment by moment 
the event is imperceptibly shaping itself and at every moment of this continuous uninterrupted shaping 
of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play 
of intrigues worries contingencies authorities projects counsels threats and deceptions and is continually obliged to 
reply to innumerable questions addressed to him which constantly conflict with one another learned military 
authorities quite seriously tell us that kutúzov should have moved his army to the kalúga 
road long before reaching filí and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him 
but a commander in chief especially at a difficult moment has always before him not 
one proposal but dozens simultaneously and all these proposals based on strategics and tactics contradict 
each other a commander in business it would seem is simply to choose one of 
these projects but even that he cannot do events and time do not wait for 
instance on the twenty eighth it is suggested to him to cross to the kalúga 
road but just then an adjutant gallops up from milorádovich asking whether he is to 
engage the french or retire an order must be given him at once that instant 
and the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the kalúga road and 
after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken 
and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go and a 
courier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the 
possibility of abandoning moscow and the commander in rival the man who is undermining him 
and there are always not merely one but several such presents a new project diametrically 
opposed to that of turning to the kalúga road and the commander in chief himself 
needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has been 
overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain and the inhabitants of the district 
pray to be defended and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and 
gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent and 
a spy a prisoner and a general who has been on reconnaissance all describe the 
position of the army differently people accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions 
of a commander in actions describe to us for instance the position of the army 
at filí and assume that the commander in chief could on the first of september 
quite freely decide whether to abandon moscow or defend it whereas with the russian army 
less than four miles from moscow no such question existed when had that question been 
settled at drissa and at smolénsk and most palpably of all on the twenty fourth 
of august at shevárdino and on the twenty sixth at borodinó and each day and 
hour and minute of the retreat from borodinó to filí chapter iii when ermólov having 
been sent by kutúzov to inspect the position told the field marshal that it was 
impossible to fight there before moscow and that they must retreat kutúzov looked at him 
in silence me your hand said he and turning it over so as to feel 
the pulse added are not well my dear fellow think what you are saying kutúzov 
could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond moscow without a battle on the 
poklónny hill four miles from the dorogomílov gate of moscow kutúzov got out of his 
carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside a great crowd of generals 
gathered round him and count rostopchín who had come out from moscow joined them this 
brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the 
position the state of the army the plans suggested the situation of moscow and military 
questions generally though they had not been summoned for the purpose and though it was 
not so called they all felt that this was really a council of war the 
conversations all dealt with public questions if anyone gave or asked for personal news it 
was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters no jokes or 
laughter or smiles even were seen among all these men they evidently all made an 
effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded and all these groups while 
talking among themselves tried to keep near the commander in chief whose bench formed the 
center of the gathering and to speak so that he might overhear them the commander 
in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their 
remarks but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion after 
hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned 
away with an air of disappointment as though they were not speaking of anything he 
wished to hear some discussed the position that had been chosen criticizing not the position 
itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it others argued 
that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought 
two days before others again spoke of the battle of salamanca which was described by 
crosart a newly arrived frenchman in a spanish uniform this frenchman and one of the 
german princes serving with the russian army were discussing the siege of saragossa and considering 
the possibility of defending moscow in a similar manner count rostopchín was telling a fourth 
group that he was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls 
of the capital but that he still could not help regretting having been left in 
ignorance of what was happening and that had he known it sooner things would have 
been different a fifth group displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions discussed the direction 
the troops would now have to take a sixth group was talking absolute nonsense expression 
grew more and more preoccupied and gloomy from all this talk he saw only one 
thing that to defend moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of those 
words that is to say so utterly impossible that if any senseless commander were to 
give orders to fight confusion would result but the battle would still not take place 
it would not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to 
be impossible but in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its inevitable 
abandonment how could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered 
impossible to hold the lower grade officers and even the soldiers who too reason also 
considered the position impossible and therefore could not go to fight fully convinced as they 
were of defeat if bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed 
it the question was no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for 
disputes and intrigue this kutúzov knew well bennigsen who had chosen the position warmly displayed 
his russian patriotism kutúzov could not listen to this without wincing by insisting that moscow 
must be defended his aim was as clear as daylight to kutúzov if the defense 
failed to throw the blame on kutúzov who had brought the army as far as 
the sparrow hills without giving battle if it succeeded to claim the success as his 
own or if battle were not given to clear himself of the crime of abandoning 
moscow but this intrigue did not now occupy the old mind one terrible question absorbed 
him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone the question for him 
now was i really allowed napoleon to reach moscow and when did i do so 
when was it decided can it have been yesterday when i ordered plátov to retreat 
or was it the evening before when i had a nap and told bennigsen to 
issue orders or was it earlier still when when was this terrible affair decided moscow 
must be abandoned the army must retreat and the order to do so must be 
given to give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of 
the army and not only did he love power to which he was accustomed the 
honours awarded to prince prozoróvski under whom he had served in turkey galled him but 
he was convinced that he was destined to save russia and that that was why 
against the wish and by the will of the people he had been chosen commander 
in chief he was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in 
these difficult circumstances and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible 
napoleon without fear and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had 
to issue but something had to be decided and these conversations around him which were 
assuming too free a character must be stopped he called the most important generals to 
him head be it good or bad must depend on itself said he rising from 
the bench and he rode to filí where his carriages were waiting chapter iv the 
council of war began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the better and 
roomier part of andrew hut the men women and children of the large peasant family 
crowded into the back room across the passage only malásha six year old granddaughter whom 
his serene highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar 
while drinking his tea remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger 
room malásha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the faces uniforms and 
decorations of the generals who one after another came into the room and sat down 
on the broad benches in the corner under the icons himself as malásha in her 
own mind called kutúzov sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven he sat 
sunk deep in a folding armchair and continually cleared his throat and pulled at the 
collar of his coat which though it was unbuttoned still seemed to pinch his neck 
those who entered went up one by one to the field marshal he pressed the 
hands of some and nodded to others his adjutant kaysárov was about to draw back 
the curtain of the window facing kutúzov but the latter moved his hand angrily and 
kaysárov understood that his serene highness did not wish his face to be seen round 
the deal table on which lay maps plans pencils and papers so many people gathered 
that the orderlies brought in another bench and put it beside the table ermólov kaysárov 
and toll who had just arrived sat down on this bench in the foremost place 
immediately under the icons sat barclay de tolly his high forehead merging into his bald 
crown he had a st cross round his neck and looked pale and ill he 
had been feverish for two days and was now shivering and in pain beside him 
sat uvárov who with rapid gesticulations was giving him some information speaking in low tones 
as they all did chubby little dokhtúrov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised and arms 
folded on his stomach on the other side sat count ostermann tolstóy seemingly absorbed in 
his own thoughts his broad head with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting 
on his hand raévski twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his 
habit glanced now at kutúzov and now at the door with a look of impatience 
firm handsome and kindly face was lit up by a tender sly smile his glance 
met and the expression of his eyes caused the little girl to smile they were 
all waiting for bennigsen who on the pretext of inspecting the position was finishing his 
savory dinner they waited for him from four till six and did not begin their 
deliberations all that time but talked in low tones of other matters only when bennigsen 
had entered the hut did kutúzov leave his corner and draw toward the table but 
not near enough for the candles that had been placed there to light up his 
face bennigsen opened the council with the question we to abandon ancient and sacred capital 
without a struggle or are we to defend it a prolonged and general silence followed 
there was a frown on every face and only angry grunts and occasional cough broke 
the silence all eyes were gazing at him malásha too looked at she was nearest 
to him and saw how his face puckered he seemed about to cry but this 
did not last long ancient and sacred capital he suddenly said repeating words in an 
angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the false note in them me to tell 
you your excellency that that question has no meaning for a russian he lurched his 
heavy body forward a question cannot be put it is senseless the question i have 
asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one the question is that 
of saving russia is it better to give up moscow without a battle or by 
accepting battle to risk losing the army as well as moscow that is the question 
on which i want your opinion and he sank back in his chair the discussion 
began bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost admitting the view of barclay and 
others that a defensive battle at filí was impossible but imbued with russian patriotism and 
the love of moscow he proposed to move troops from the right to the left 
flank during the night and attack the french right flank the following day opinions were 
divided and arguments were advanced for and against that project ermólov dokhtúrov and raévski agreed 
with bennigsen whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital or 
guided by other personal considerations these generals seemed not to understand that this council could 
not alter the inevitable course of events and that moscow was in effect already abandoned 
the other generals however understood it and leaving aside the question of moscow spoke of 
the direction the army should take in its retreat malásha who kept her eyes fixed 
on what was going on before her understood the meaning of the council differently it 
seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between and as she termed 
bennigsen she saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one another and in 
her heart she sided with in the midst of the conversation she noticed give bennigsen 
a quick subtle glance and then to her joys she saw that said something to 
which settled him bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room what 
so affected him was calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of proposal 
to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to attack the 
french right wing said kutúzov cannot approve of the plan moving troops in close proximity 
to an enemy is always dangerous and military history supports that view for instance kutúzov 
seemed to reflect searching for an example then with a clear naïve look at bennigsen 
he added yes take the battle of friedland which i think the count well remembers 
and which was not fully successful only because our troops were rearranged too near the 
enemy there followed a momentary pause which seemed very long to them all the discussion 
recommenced but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to 
be said during one of these pauses kutúzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing 
to speak they all looked at him gentlemen i see that it is i who 
will have to pay for the broken crockery said he and rising slowly he moved 
to the table i have heard your views some of you will not agree with 
me but i he paused the authority entrusted to me by my sovereign and country 
order a retreat after that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and circumspect 
silence of people who are leaving after a funeral some of the generals in low 
tones and in a strain very different from the way they had spoken during the 
council communicated something to their commander in chief malásha who had long been expected for 
supper climbed carefully backwards down from the oven her bare little feet catching at its 
projections and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted out of the room 
when he had dismissed the generals kutúzov sat a long time with his elbows on 
the table thinking always of the same terrible question when did the abandonment of moscow 
become inevitable when was that done which settled the matter and who was to blame 
for it did not expect this said he to his adjutant schneider when the latter 
came in late that night did not expect this i did not think this would 
happen should take some rest your serene highness replied schneider no they shall eat horseflesh 
yet like the turks exclaimed kutúzov without replying striking the table with his podgy fist 
shall too if only chapter v at that very time in circumstances even more important 
than retreating without a battle namely the evacuation and burning of moscow rostopchín who is 
usually represented as being the instigator of that event acted in an altogether different manner 
from kutúzov after the battle of borodinó the abandonment and burning of moscow was as 
inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond moscow without fighting every russian might have 
predicted it not by reasoning but by the feeling implanted in each of us and 
in our fathers the same thing that took place in moscow had happened in all 
the towns and villages on russian soil beginning with smolénsk without the participation of count 
rostopchín and his broadsheets the people awaited the enemy unconcernedly did not riot or become 
excited or tear anyone to pieces but faced its fate feeling within it the strength 
to find what it should do at that most difficult moment and as soon as 
the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property while the poorer 
remained and burned and destroyed what was left the consciousness that this would be so 
and would always be so was and is present in the heart of every russian 
and a consciousness of this and a foreboding that moscow would be taken was present 
in russian moscow society in 1812 those who had quitted moscow already in july and 
at the beginning of august showed that they expected this those who went away taking 
what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings did so from the 
latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving children to save the 
fatherland and similar unnatural exploits but unobtrusively simply organically and therefore in the way that 
always produces the most powerful results is disgraceful to run away from danger only cowards 
are running away from moscow they were told in his broadsheets rostopchín impressed on them 
that to leave moscow was shameful they were ashamed to be called cowards ashamed to 
leave but still they left knowing it had to be done why did they go 
it is impossible to suppose that rostopchín had scared them by his accounts of horrors 
napoleon had committed in conquered countries the first people to go away were the rich 
educated people who knew quite well that vienna and berlin had remained intact and that 
during occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming 
frenchmen whom the russians and especially the russian ladies then liked so much they went 
away because for russians there could be no question as to whether things would go 
well or ill under french rule in moscow it was out of the question to 
be under french rule it would be the worst thing that could happen they went 
away even before the battle of borodinó and still more rapidly after it despite calls 
to defend moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder working icon 
of the iberian mother of god and go to fight or of the balloons that 
were to destroy the french and despite all the nonsense rostopchín wrote in his broadsheets 
they knew that it was for the army to fight and that if it could 
not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house serfs to the 
three hills quarter of moscow to fight napoleon and that they must go away sorry 
as they were to abandon their property to destruction they went away without thinking of 
the tremendous significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to destruction for 
a great city with wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be 
burned they went away each on his own account and yet it was only in 
consequence of their going away that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain 
the greatest glory of the russian people the lady who afraid of being stopped by 
count orders had already in june moved with her negroes and her women jesters from 
moscow to her sarátov estate with a vague consciousness that she was not servant was 
really simply and truly carrying out the great work which saved russia but count rostopchín 
who now taunted those who left moscow and now had the government offices removed now 
distributed quite useless weapons to the drunken rabble now had processions displaying the icons and 
now forbade father augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints now seized all 
the private carts in moscow and on one hundred and thirty six of them removed 
the balloon that was being constructed by leppich now hinted that he would burn moscow 
and related how he had set fire to his own house now wrote a proclamation 
to the french solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his orphanage now claimed the glory 
of having hinted that he would burn moscow and now repudiated the deed now ordered 
the people to catch all spies and bring them to him and now reproached them 
for doing so now expelled all the french residents from moscow and now allowed madame 
aubert chalmé the center of the whole french colony in moscow to remain but ordered 
the venerable old postmaster klyucharëv to be arrested and exiled for no particular offense now 
assembled the people at the three hills to fight the french and now to get 
rid of them handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove 
away by a back gate now declared that he would not survive the fall of 
moscow and now wrote french verses in albums concerning his share in the man did 
not understand the meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself 
that would astonish people to perform some patriotically heroic feat and like a child he 
made sport of the momentous and unavoidable abandonment and burning of tried with his puny 
hand now to speed and now to stay the enormous popular tide that bore him 
along with it chapter vi hélène having returned with the court from vílna to petersburg 
found herself in a difficult position in petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of 
a grandee who occupied one of the highest posts in the empire in vílna she 
had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince when she returned to petersburg both 
the magnate and the prince were there and both claimed their rights hélène was faced 
by a new to preserve her intimacy with both without offending either what would have 
seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did not cause the least embarrassment to 
countess bezúkhova who evidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman had she 
attempted concealment or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position by cunning she would 
have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself guilty but hélène like a really great man 
who can do whatever he pleases at once assumed her own position to be correct 
as she sincerely believed it to be and that everyone else was to blame the 
first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her she lifted her beautiful head 
and half turning to him said firmly just like a and cruel i expected nothing 
else a woman sacrifices herself for you she suffers and this is her reward what 
right have you monseigneur to demand an account of my attachments and friendships he is 
a man who has been more than a father to me the prince was about 
to say something but hélène interrupted him yes said she may be that he has 
other sentiments for me than those of a father but that is not a reason 
for me to shut my door on him i am not a man that i 
should repay kindness with ingratitude know monseigneur that in all that relates to my intimate 
feelings i render account only to god and to my conscience she concluded laying her 
hand on her beautiful fully expanded bosom and looking up to heaven for sake listen 
to me me and i will be your slave impossible deign to demean yourself by 
marrying me you said hélène beginning to cry the prince tried to comfort her but 
hélène as if quite distraught said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent 
her marrying that there were precedents there were up to that time very few but 
she mentioned napoleon and some other exalted personages that she had never been her wife 
and that she had been sacrificed the law religion said the prince already yielding law 
religion what have they been invented for if they arrange that said hélène the prince 
was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him and he applied 
for advice to the holy brethren of the society of jesus with whom he was 
on intimate terms a few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which hélène 
gave at her country house on the stone island the charming monsieur de jobert a 
man no longer young with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes a jesuit à 
robe courte was presented to her and in the garden by the light of the 
illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a long time of 
the love of god of christ of the sacred heart and of the consolations the 
one true catholic religion affords in this world and the next hélène was touched and 
more than once tears rose to her eyes and to those of monsieur de jobert 
and their voices trembled a dance for which her partner came to seek her put 
an end to her discourse with her future directeur de conscience but the next evening 
monsieur de jobert came to see hélène when she was alone and after that often 
came again lay member of the society of jesus one day he took the countess 
to a roman catholic church where she knelt down before the altar to which she 
was led the enchanting middle aged frenchman laid his hands on her head and as 
she herself afterward described it she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her 
soul it was explained to her that this was la grâce after that a long 
frocked abbé was brought to her she confessed to him and he absolved her from 
her sins next day she received a box containing the sacred host which was left 
at her house for her to partake of a few days later hélène learned with 
pleasure that she had now been admitted to the true catholic church and that in 
a few days the pope himself would hear of her and would send her a 
certain document all that was done around her and to her at this time all 
the attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant 
refined ways and the state of dove like purity she was now in she wore 
only white dresses and white ribbons all that time gave her pleasure but her pleasure 
did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim and as it always 
happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones 
realized that the main object of all these words and all this trouble was after 
converting her to catholicism to obtain money from her for jesuit institutions as to which 
she received indications parting with her money insisted that the various operations necessary to free 
her from her husband should be performed in her view the aim of every religion 
was merely to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to human desires and with this 
aim in one of her talks with her father confessor she insisted on an answer 
to the question in how far was she bound by her marriage they were sitting 
in the twilight by a window in the drawing room the scent of flowers came 
in at the window hélène was wearing a white dress transparent over her shoulders and 
bosom the abbé a well fed man with a plump clean shaven chin a pleasant 
firm mouth and white hands meekly folded on his knees sat close to hélène and 
with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her 
beauty occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the subject hélène 
with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his plump clean shaven blackish 
cheeks and every moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn but the abbé 
though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion was absorbed in his mastery of 
the matter the course of the father arguments ran as follows of the import of 
what you were undertaking you made a vow of conjugal fidelity to a man who 
on his part by entering the married state without faith in the religious significance of 
marriage committed an act of sacrilege that marriage lacked the dual significance it should have 
had yet in spite of this your vow was binding you swerved from it what 
did you commit by so acting a venial or a mortal sin a venial sin 
for you acted without evil intention if now you married again with the object of 
bearing children your sin might be forgiven but the question is again a twofold one 
firstly but suddenly hélène who was getting bored said with one of her bewitching smiles 
i think that having espoused the true religion i cannot be bound by what a 
false religion laid upon me the director of her conscience was astounded at having the 
case presented to him thus with the simplicity of egg he was delighted at the 
unexpected rapidity of his progress but could not abandon the edifice of argument he had 
laboriously constructed us understand one another countess said he with a smile and began refuting 
his spiritual arguments chapter vii hélène understood that the question was very simple and easy 
from the ecclesiastical point of view and that her directors were making difficulties only because 
they were apprehensive as to how the matter would be regarded by the secular authorities 
so she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society she provoked 
the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she had told her other 
suitor that is she put the matter so that the only way for him to 
obtain a right over her was to marry her the elderly magnate was at first 
as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage with a woman whose husband was 
alive as the younger man had been but imperturbable conviction that it was as simple 
and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him too had hélène herself 
shown the least sign of hesitation shame or secrecy her cause would certainly have been 
lost but not only did she show no signs of secrecy or shame on the 
contrary with good natured naïveté she told her intimate friends and these were all petersburg 
that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved 
both and was afraid of grieving either a rumor immediately spread in petersburg not that 
hélène wanted to be divorced from her husband had such a report spread many would 
have opposed so illegal an intention but simply that the unfortunate and interesting hélène was 
in doubt which of the two men she should marry the question was no longer 
whether this was possible but only which was the better match and how the matter 
would be regarded at court there were it is true some rigid individuals unable to 
rise to the height of such a question who saw in the project a desecration 
of the sacrament of marriage but there were not many such and they remained silent 
while the majority were interested in good fortune and in the question which match would 
be the more advantageous whether it was right or wrong to remarry while one had 
a husband living they did not discuss for that question had evidently been settled by 
people than you or me as they said and to doubt the correctness of that 
decision would be to risk exposing stupidity and incapacity to live in society only márya 
dmítrievna akhrosímova who had come to petersburg that summer to see one of her sons 
allowed herself plainly to express an opinion contrary to the general one meeting hélène at 
a ball she stopped her in the middle of the room and amid general silence 
said in her gruff voice wives of living men have started marrying again perhaps you 
think you have invented a novelty you have been forestalled my dear it was thought 
of long ago it is done in all the brothels and with these words márya 
dmítrievna turning up her wide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round 
moved across the room though people were afraid of márya dmítrievna she was regarded in 
petersburg as a buffoon and so of what she had said they only noticed and 
repeated in a whisper the one coarse word she had used supposing the whole sting 
of her remark to lie in that word prince vasíli who of late very often 
forgot what he had said and repeated one and the same thing a hundred times 
remarked to his daughter whenever he chanced to see her i have a word to 
say to you and he would lead her aside drawing her hand downward have heard 
of certain projects concerning you know well my dear child you know how your heart 
rejoices to know that you you have suffered so much but my dear child consult 
only your own heart that is all i have to say and concealing his unvarying 
emotion he would press his cheek against his and move away bilíbin who had not 
lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man and who was one of the disinterested 
friends so brilliant a woman as hélène always friends who can never change into gave 
her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering bilíbin said hélène 
she always called friends of that sort by their surnames and she touched his coat 
sleeve with her white beringed fingers me as you would a sister what i ought 
to do which of the two bilíbin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and 
pondered with a smile on his lips are not taking me unawares you know said 
he a true friend i have thought and thought again about your affair you see 
if you marry the meant the younger he crooked one finger forever lose the chance 
of marrying the other and you will displease the court besides you know there is 
some kind of connection but if you marry the old count you will make his 
last days happy and as widow of the grand the prince would no longer be 
making a mésalliance by marrying you and bilíbin smoothed out his forehead a true friend 
said hélène beaming and again touching sleeve i love them you know and want to 
distress either of them i would give my life for the happiness of them both 
bilíbin shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that not even he could help 
in that difficulty maîtresse femme what is called putting things squarely she would like to 
be married to all three at the same time thought he a masterly woman tell 
me how will your husband look at the matter bilíbin asked his reputation being so 
well established that he did not fear to ask so naïve a question he agree 
he loves me so said hélène who for some reason imagined that pierre too loved 
her will do anything for me bilíbin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty 
divorce you said he hélène laughed among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of 
the proposed marriage was mother princess kurágina she was continually tormented by jealousy of her 
daughter and now that jealousy concerned a subject near to her own heart she could 
not reconcile herself to the idea she consulted a russian priest as to the possibility 
of divorce and remarriage during a lifetime and the priest told her that it was 
impossible and to her delight showed her a text in the gospel which as it 
seemed to him plainly forbids remarriage while the husband is alive armed with these arguments 
which appeared to her unanswerable she drove to her early one morning so as to 
find her alone having listened to her objections hélène smiled blandly and ironically it says 
plainly shall marry her that is divorced said the old princess maman ne dites pas 
de bêtises vous ne comprenez rien dans ma position des devoirs said hélène changing from 
russian in which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear 
into french which suited it better mamma talk nonsense you understand anything in my position 
i have obligations my dear mamma how is it you understand that the holy father 
who has the right to grant dispensations just then the lady companion who lived with 
hélène came in to announce that his highness was in the ballroom and wished to 
see her dites lui que je ne veux pas le voir que je suis furieuse 
contre lui parce manqué parole tell him i wish to see him i am furious 
with him for not keeping his word to me à tout péché miséricorde said a 
fair haired young man with a long face and nose as he entered the room 
there is mercy for every sin the old princess rose respectfully and curtsied the young 
man who had entered took no notice of her the princess nodded to her daughter 
and sidled out of the room she is right thought the old princess all her 
convictions dissipated by the appearance of his highness is right but how is it that 
we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it yet it is so simple she 
thought as she got into her carriage by the beginning of august affairs were clearly 
defined and she wrote a letter to her as she imagined loved her very him 
of her intention to marry n n and of her having embraced the one true 
faith and asking him to carry out all the formalities necessary for a divorce which 
would be explained to him by the bearer of the letter and so i pray 
god to have you my friend in his holy and powerful friend hélène this letter 
was brought to house when he was on the field of borodinó chapter viii toward 
the end of the battle of borodinó pierre having run down from battery a second 
time made his way through a gully to knyazkóvo with a crowd of soldiers reached 
the dressing station and seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on still entangled 
in the crowds of soldiers the one thing he now desired with his whole soul 
was to get away quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that 
day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in 
his own bed he felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he 
be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt but such ordinary 
conditions of life were nowhere to be found though shells and bullets did not whistle 
over the road along which he was going still on all sides there was what 
there had been on the field of battle there were still the same suffering exhausted 
and sometimes strangely indifferent faces the same blood the same overcoats the same sounds of 
firing which though distant now still aroused terror and besides this there were the foul 
air and the dust having gone a couple of miles along the mozháysk road pierre 
sat down by the roadside dusk had fallen and the roar of guns died away 
pierre lay leaning on his elbow for a long time gazing at the shadows that 
moved past him in the darkness he was continually imagining that a cannon ball was 
flying toward him with a terrific whizz and then he shuddered and sat up he 
had no idea how long he had been there in the middle of the night 
three soldiers having brought some firewood settled down near him and began lighting a fire 
the soldiers who threw sidelong glances at pierre got the fire to burn and placed 
an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and put a 
little dripping the pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with the smell of smoke pierre 
sat up and sighed the three soldiers were eating and talking among themselves taking no 
notice of him who may you be one of them suddenly asked pierre evidently meaning 
what pierre himself had in mind namely you want to eat give you some food 
only let us know whether you are an honest man i said pierre feeling it 
necessary to minimize his social position as much as possible so as to be nearer 
to the soldiers and better understood by them rights i am a militia officer but 
my men are not here i came to the battle and have lost them now 
said one of the soldiers another shook his head you like a little mash the 
first soldier asked and handed pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean pierre sat 
down by the fire and began eating the mash as they called the food in 
the cauldron and he thought it more delicious than any food he had ever tasted 
as he sat bending greedily over it helping himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one 
after another his face was lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at 
him in silence have you to go to tell us said one of them mozháysk 
a gentleman you your name kirílych then peter kirílych come along with us take you 
there in the total darkness the soldiers walked with pierre to mozháysk by the time 
they got near mozháysk and began ascending the steep hill into the town the cocks 
were already crowing pierre went on with the soldiers quite forgetting that his inn was 
at the bottom of the hill and that he had already passed it he would 
not soon have remembered this such was his state of forgetfulness had he not halfway 
up the hill stumbled upon his groom who had been to look for him in 
the town and was returning to the inn the groom recognized pierre in the darkness 
by his white hat excellency he said we were beginning to despair how is it 
you are on foot and where are you going please yes said pierre the soldiers 
stopped found your folk said one of them good by peter it by peter kirílych 
pierre heard the other voices repeat by he said and turned with his groom toward 
the inn ought to give them something he thought and felt in his pocket better 
not said another inner voice there was not a room to be had at the 
inn they were all occupied pierre went out into the yard and covering himself up 
head and all lay down in his carriage chapter ix scarcely had pierre laid his 
head on the pillow before he felt himself falling asleep but suddenly almost with the 
distinctness of reality he heard the boom boom boom of firing the thud of projectiles 
groans and cries and smelled blood and powder and a feeling of horror and dread 
of death seized him filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head 
from under his cloak all was tranquil in the yard only orderly passed through the 
gateway splashing through the mud and talked to the innkeeper above head some pigeons disturbed 
by the movement he had made in sitting up fluttered under the dark roof of 
the penthouse the whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards 
delightful to pierre at that moment he could see the clear starry sky between the 
dark roofs of two penthouses god there is no more of that he thought covering 
up his head again what a terrible thing is fear and how shamefully i yielded 
to it but they they were steady and calm all the time to the end 
thought he they in mind were the soldiers those who had been at the battery 
those who had given him food and those who had prayed before the icon they 
those strange men he had not previously known stood out clearly and sharply from everyone 
else be a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he fell asleep enter communal 
life completely to be imbued by what makes them what they are but how to 
cast off all the superfluous devilish burden of my outer man there was a time 
when i could have done it i could have run away from my father as 
i wanted to or i might have been sent to serve as a soldier after 
the duel with dólokhov and the memory of the dinner at the english club when 
he had challenged dólokhov flashed through mind and then he remembered his benefactor at torzhók 
and now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his 
mind it was taking place at the english club and someone near and dear to 
him sat at the end of the table that is he it is my benefactor 
but he died thought pierre he died and i did not know he was alive 
how sorry i am that he died and how glad i am that he is 
alive again on one side of the table sat anatole dólokhov nesvítski denísov and others 
like them in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as clearly 
defined in his mind as the category of those he termed they and he heard 
those people anatole and dólokhov shouting and singing loudly yet through their shouting the voice 
of his benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words 
was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield but pleasant and comforting 
pierre did not understand what his benefactor was saying but he knew the categories of 
thoughts were also quite distinct in his dream that he was talking of goodness and 
the possibility of being what they were and they with their simple kind firm faces 
surrounded his benefactor on all sides but though they were kindly they did not look 
at pierre and did not know him wishing to speak and to attract their attention 
he got up but at that moment his legs grew cold and bare he felt 
ashamed and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact 
slipped for a moment as he was rearranging his cloak pierre opened his eyes and 
saw the same penthouse roofs posts and yard but now they were all bluish lit 
up and glittering with frost or dew is dawn thought pierre not what i want 
i want to hear and understand my words again he covered himself up with his 
cloak but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there there were only thoughts 
clearly expressed in words thoughts that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating 
afterwards when he recalled those thoughts pierre was convinced that someone outside himself had spoken 
them though the impressions of that day had evoked them he had never it seemed 
to him been able to think and express his thoughts like that when awake endure 
war is the most difficult subordination of freedom to the law of god the voice 
had said is submission to the will of god you cannot escape from him and 
they are simple they do not talk but act the spoken word is silver but 
the unspoken is golden man can be master of nothing while he fears death but 
he who does not fear it possesses all if there were no suffering man would 
not know his limitations would not know himself the hardest thing pierre went on thinking 
or hearing in his dream is to be able in your soul to unite the 
meaning of all to unite all he asked himself not to unite thoughts cannot be 
united but to harness all these thoughts together is what we need yes one must 
harness them must harness them he repeated to himself with inward rapture feeling that these 
words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the question that 
tormented him one must harness it is time to harness to harness time to harness 
your excellency your excellency some voice was repeating must harness it is time to harness 
it was the voice of the groom trying to wake him the sun shone straight 
into face he glanced at the dirty innyard in the middle of which soldiers were 
watering their lean horses at the pump while carts were passing out of the gate 
pierre turned away with repugnance and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage 
seat i want that i want to see and understand that i want to understand 
what was revealing itself to me in my dream one second more and i should 
have understood it all but what am i to do harness but how can i 
harness everything and pierre felt with horror that the meaning of all he had seen 
and thought in the dream had been destroyed the groom the coachman and the innkeeper 
told pierre that an officer had come with news that the french were already near 
mozháysk and that our men were leaving it pierre got up and having told them 
to harness and overtake him went on foot through the town the troops were moving 
on leaving about ten thousand wounded behind them there were wounded in the yards at 
the windows of the houses and the streets were crowded with them in the streets 
around carts that were to take some of the wounded away shouts curses and blows 
could be heard pierre offered the use of his carriage which had overtaken him to 
a wounded general he knew and drove with him to moscow on the way pierre 
was told of the death of his brother in law anatole and of that of 
prince andrew chapter x on the thirtieth of august pierre reached moscow close to the 
gates of the city he was met by count adjutant have been looking for you 
everywhere said the adjutant count wants to see you particularly he asks you to come 
to him at once on a very important matter without going home pierre took a 
cab and drove to see the moscow commander in chief count rostopchín had only that 
morning returned to town from his summer villa at sokólniki the anteroom and reception room 
of his house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for 
orders vasílchikov and plátov had already seen the count and explained to him that it 
was impossible to defend moscow and that it would have to be surrendered though this 
news was being concealed from the inhabitants the heads of the various government that moscow 
would soon be in the hands just as count rostopchín himself knew it and to 
escape personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how they were 
to deal with their various departments as pierre was entering the reception room a courier 
from the army came out of private room in answer to questions with which he 
was greeted the courier made a despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the 
room while waiting in the reception room pierre with weary eyes watched the various officials 
old and young military and civilian who were there they all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy 
pierre went up to a group of men one of whom he knew after greeting 
pierre they continued their conversation sent out and brought back again later on it will 
do no harm but as things are now one answer for anything you see what 
he writes said another pointing to a printed sheet he held in his hand another 
matter necessary for the people said the first is it asked pierre a fresh broadsheet 
pierre took it and began reading his serene highness has passed through mozháysk in order 
to join up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong 
position where the enemy will not soon attack him forty eight guns with ammunition have 
been sent him from here and his serene highness says he will defend moscow to 
the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in the streets do 
not be upset brothers that the law courts are closed things have to be put 
in order and we will deal with villains in our own way when the time 
comes i shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a 
day or two beforehand but they are not wanted yet so i hold my peace 
an ax will be useful a hunting spear not bad but a three pronged fork 
will be best of all a frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye 
tomorrow after dinner i shall take the iberian icon of the mother of god to 
the wounded in the catherine hospital where we will have some water blessed that will 
help them to get well quicker i too am well now one of my eyes 
was sore but now i am on the lookout with both military men have told 
me that it is impossible to fight in the town said pierre that the position 
of course what we were saying replied the first speaker what does he mean by 
of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout with asked pierre 
count had a sty replied the adjutant smiling was very much upset when i told 
him people had come to ask what was the matter with him by the by 
count he added suddenly addressing pierre with a smile heard that you have family troubles 
and that the countess your wife have heard nothing pierre replied unconcernedly what have you 
heard well you know people often invent things i only say what i heard what 
did you hear they say continued the adjutant with the same smile the countess your 
wife is preparing to go abroad i expect nonsense remarked pierre looking about him absent 
mindedly who is that he asked indicating a short old man in a clean blue 
peasant overcoat with a big snow white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face a 
tradesman that is to say the restaurant keeper vereshchágin perhaps you have heard of that 
affair with the proclamation so that is vereshchágin said pierre looking at the firm calm 
face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor not 
he himself the father of the fellow who wrote the proclamation said the adjutant young 
man is in prison and i expect it will go hard with him an old 
gentleman wearing a star and another official a german wearing a cross round his neck 
approached the speaker a complicated story you know said the adjutant proclamation appeared about two 
months ago the count was informed of it he gave orders to investigate the matter 
gabriel ivánovich here made the inquiries the proclamation had passed through exactly sixty three hands 
he asked one whom did you get it so and so he went to the 
next one whom did you get it and so on till he reached vereshchágin a 
half educated tradesman you know pet of a trader said the adjutant smiling asked him 
gave it you and the point is that we knew whom he had it from 
he could only have had it from the postmaster but evidently they had come to 
some understanding he replied no one i made it up myself they threatened and questioned 
him but he stuck to that made it up myself and so it was reported 
to the count who sent for the man whom did you get the proclamation wrote 
it myself well you know the count said the adjutant cheerfully with a smile of 
pride flared up just think of the audacity lying and obstinacy the count wanted him 
to say it was from klyucharëv i understand said pierre at all rejoined the adjutant 
in dismay had his own sins to answer for without that and that is why 
he has been banished but the point is that the count was much annoyed could 
you have written it yourself said he and he took up the hamburg gazette that 
was lying on the table it is you did not write it yourself but translated 
it and translated it abominably because you even know french you fool and what do 
you think said he have not read any papers i made it up myself so 
a traitor and have you tried and be hanged say from whom you had it 
have seen no papers i made it up myself and that was the end of 
it the count had the father fetched but the fellow stuck to it he was 
sent for trial and condemned to hard labor i believe now the father has come 
to intercede for him but a good for nothing lad you know that sort of 
son a dandy and lady killer he attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the 
devil is no match for him the sort of fellow he is his father keeps 
a cookshop here by the stone bridge and you know there was a large icon 
of god almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the 
other well he took that icon home with him for a few days and what 
did he do he found some scoundrel of a painter chapter xi in the middle 
of this fresh tale pierre was summoned to the commander in chief when he entered 
the private room count rostopchín puckering his face was rubbing his forehead and eyes with 
his hand a short man was saying something but when pierre entered he stopped speaking 
and went out how do you do great warrior said rostopchín as soon as the 
short man had left the room have heard of your prowess but not the point 
between ourselves mon cher do you belong to the masons he went on severely as 
though there were something wrong about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon pierre remained 
silent am well informed my friend but i am aware that there are masons and 
i hope that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind 
wish to ruin russia i am a mason pierre replied you see mon cher i 
expect you know that messrs speránski and magnítski have been deported to their proper place 
mr klyucharëv has been treated in the same way and so have others who on 
the plea of building up the temple of solomon have tried to destroy the temple 
of their fatherland you can understand that there are reasons for this and that i 
could not have exiled the postmaster had he not been a harmful person it has 
now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal from 
town and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody i like 
you and wish you any harm you are only half my advise you as a 
father would to cease all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here 
as soon as possible what did klyucharëv do wrong count asked pierre is for me 
to know but not for you to ask shouted rostopchín he is accused of circulating 
proclamation it is not proved that he did so said pierre without looking at rostopchín 
vereshchágin we are rostopchín shouted at pierre louder than before frowning suddenly is a renegade 
and a traitor who will be punished as he deserves said he with the vindictive 
heat with which people speak when recalling an insult i did not summon you to 
discuss my actions but to give you an order if you prefer it i beg 
you to leave the town and break off all communication with such men as klyucharëv 
and i will knock the nonsense out of probably realizing that he was shouting at 
bezúkhov who so far was not guilty of anything he added taking hand in a 
friendly manner are on the eve of a public disaster and i time to be 
polite to everybody who has business with me my head is sometimes in a whirl 
well mon cher what are you doing personally nothing answered pierre without raising his eyes 
or changing the thoughtful expression of his face the count frowned word of friendly advice 
mon cher be off as soon as you can all i have to tell you 
happy he who has ears to hear good by my dear fellow oh by the 
by he shouted through the doorway after pierre it true that the countess has fallen 
into the clutches of the holy fathers of the society of jesus pierre did not 
answer and left room more sullen and angry than he had ever before shown himself 
when he reached home it was already getting dark some eight people had come to 
see him that evening the secretary of a committee the colonel of his battalion his 
steward his major domo and various petitioners they all had business with pierre and wanted 
decisions from him pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these 
questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these people when left 
alone at last he opened and read his letter the soldiers at the battery prince 
andrew killed that old man simplicity is submission to god suffering is necessary the meaning 
of all one must harness my wife is getting married one must forget and understand 
and going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell 
asleep when he awoke next morning the major domo came to inform him that a 
special messenger a police officer had come from count rostopchín to know whether count bezúkhov 
had left or was leaving the town a dozen persons who had business with pierre 
were awaiting him in the drawing room pierre dressed hurriedly and instead of going to 
see them went to the back porch and out through the gate from that time 
till the end of the destruction of moscow no one of household despite all the 
search they made saw pierre again or knew where he was chapter xii the rostóvs 
remained in moscow till the first of september that is till the eve of the 
entry into the city after pétya had joined regiment of cossacks and left for bélaya 
tsérkov where that regiment was forming the countess was seized with terror the thought that 
both her sons were at the war had both gone from under her wing that 
today or tomorrow either or both of them might be killed like the three sons 
of one of her acquaintances struck her that summer for the first time with cruel 
clearness she tried to get nicholas back and wished to go herself to join pétya 
or to get him an appointment somewhere in petersburg but neither of these proved possible 
pétya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to 
another regiment on active service nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent 
a word since his last letter in which he had given a detailed account of 
his meeting with princess mary the countess did not sleep at night or when she 
did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead after many consultations and 
conversations the count at last devised means to tranquillize her he got pétya transferred from 
regiment to which was in training near moscow though pétya would remain in the service 
this transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her 
sons under her wing and she hoped to arrange matters for her pétya so as 
not to let him go again but always get him appointed to places where he 
could not possibly take part in a battle as long as nicholas alone was in 
danger the countess imagined that she loved her first born more than all her other 
children and even reproached herself for it but when her youngest the scapegrace who had 
been bad at lessons was always breaking things in the house and making himself a 
nuisance to everybody that snub nosed pétya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy 
cheeks where soft down was just beginning to he was thrown amid those big dreadful 
cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in his mother 
thought she loved him more much more than all her other children the nearer the 
time came for pétya to return the more uneasy grew the countess she began to 
think she would never live to see such happiness the presence of sónya of her 
beloved natásha or even of her husband irritated her do i want with them i 
want no one but pétya she thought at the end of august the rostóvs received 
another letter from nicholas he wrote from the province of vorónezh where he had been 
sent to procure remounts but that letter did not set the countess at ease knowing 
that one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about pétya though 
by the twentieth of august nearly all the acquaintances had left moscow and though everybody 
tried to persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible she would not 
hear of leaving before her treasure her adored pétya returned on the twenty eighth of 
august he arrived the passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did not please 
the sixteen year old officer though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him 
under her wing pétya guessed her designs and instinctively fearing that he might give way 
to emotion when with as he termed it to treated her coldly avoided her and 
during his stay in moscow attached himself exclusively to natásha for whom he had always 
had a particularly brotherly tenderness almost lover like owing to the customary carelessness nothing was 
ready for their departure by the twenty eighth of august and the carts that were 
to come from their ryazán and moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not 
arrive till the thirtieth from the twenty eighth till the thirty first all moscow was 
in a bustle and commotion every day thousands of men wounded at borodinó were brought 
in by the dorogomílov gate and taken to various parts of moscow and thousands of 
carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gates in spite of 
broadsheets or because of them or independently of them the strangest and most contradictory rumors 
were current in the town some said that no one was to be allowed to 
leave the city others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken 
out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave some said there 
had been another battle after borodinó at which the french had been routed while others 
on the contrary reported that the russian army had been destroyed some talked about the 
moscow militia which preceded by the clergy would go to the three hills others whispered 
that augustin had been forbidden to leave that traitors had been seized that the peasants 
were rioting and robbing people on their way from moscow and so on but all 
this was only talk in reality though the council of filí at which it was 
decided to abandon moscow had not yet been held both those who went away and 
those who remained behind felt though they did not show it that moscow would certainly 
be abandoned and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save 
their belongings it was felt that everything would suddenly break up and change but up 
to the first of september nothing had done so as a criminal who is being 
led to execution knows that he must die immediately but yet looks about him and 
straightens the cap that is awry on his head so moscow involuntarily continued its wonted 
life though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the conditions 
of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely upset during 
the three days preceding the occupation of moscow the whole rostóv family was absorbed in 
various activities the head of the family count ilyá rostóv continually drove about the city 
collecting the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders at home 
about the preparations for their departure the countess watched the things being packed was dissatisfied 
with everything was constantly in pursuit of pétya who was always running away from her 
and was jealous of natásha with whom he spent all his time sónya alone directed 
the practical side of matters by getting things packed but of late sónya had been 
particularly sad and silent letter in which he mentioned princess mary had elicited in her 
presence joyous comments from the countess who saw an intervention of providence in this meeting 
of the princess and nicholas was never pleased at engagement to natásha said the countess 
i always wanted nicholas to marry the princess and had a presentiment that it would 
happen what a good thing it would be sónya felt that this was true that 
the only possibility of retrieving the affairs was by nicholas marrying a rich woman and 
that the princess was a good match it was very bitter for her but despite 
her grief or perhaps just because of it she took on herself all the difficult 
work of directing the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole 
days the count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give 
pétya and natásha on the contrary far from helping their parents were generally a nuisance 
and a hindrance to everyone almost all day long the house resounded with their running 
feet their cries and their spontaneous laughter they laughed and were gay not because there 
was any reason to laugh but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and 
so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them pétya was 
in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned as everybody told 
him a fine young man because he was at home because he had left bélaya 
tsérkov where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had 
come to moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly 
because natásha whose lead he always followed was in high spirits natásha was gay because 
she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of 
her sadness and because she was feeling well she was also happy because she had 
someone to adore her the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her 
machine needed to make them run pétya adored her above all they were gay because 
there was a war near moscow there would be fighting at the town gates arms 
were being given out everybody was away somewhere and in general something extraordinary was happening 
and that is always exciting especially to the young chapter xiii on saturday the thirty 
first of august everything in the house seemed topsy turvy all the doors were open 
all the furniture was being carried out or moved about and the mirrors and pictures 
had been taken down there were trunks in the rooms and hay wrapping paper and 
ropes were scattered about the peasants and house serfs carrying out the things were treading 
heavily on the parquet floors the yard was crowded with peasant carts some loaded high 
and already corded up others still empty the voices and footsteps of the many servants 
and of the peasants who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to 
one another in the yard and in the house the count had been out since 
morning the countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and 
was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head 
pétya was not at home he had gone to visit a friend with whom he 
meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army sónya was in 
the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china natásha was sitting on 
the floor of her dismantled room with dresses ribbons and scarves strewn all about her 
gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress already 
out of fashion which she had worn at her first petersburg ball natásha was ashamed 
of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy and several times that morning had 
tried to set to work but her heart was not in it and she could 
not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and 
all her might for a while she had stood beside sónya while the china was 
being packed and tried to help but soon gave it up and went to her 
room to pack her own things at first she found it amusing to give away 
dresses and ribbons to the maids but when that was done and what was left 
had still to be packed she found it dull you pack you will you dear 
and when dunyásha willingly promised to do it all for her natásha sat down on 
the floor took her old ball dress and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to 
what ought to have occupied her thoughts now she was roused from her reverie by 
the talk of the maids in the next room which was theirs and by the 
sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch natásha got up and looked 
out of the window an enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had 
stopped in the street the housekeeper the old nurse the cooks coachmen maids footmen postilions 
and scullions stood at the gate staring at the wounded natásha throwing a clean pocket 
handkerchief over her hair and holding an end of it in each hand went out 
into the street the former housekeeper old mávra kuzmínichna had stepped out of the crowd 
by the gate gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats 
and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside natásha moved a few 
steps forward and stopped shyly still holding her handkerchief and listened to what the housekeeper 
was saying you have nobody in moscow she was saying would be more comfortable somewhere 
in a house in ours for instance the family are leaving know if it would 
be allowed replied the officer in a weak voice is our commanding officer ask him 
and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past 
the row of carts natásha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded 
officer and at once went to meet the major the wounded men stay in our 
house she asked the major raised his hand to his cap with a smile one 
do you want said he screwing up his eyes and smiling natásha quietly repeated her 
question and her face and whole manner were so serious though she was still holding 
the ends of her handkerchief that the major ceased smiling and after some if considering 
in how far the thing was in the affirmative yes why not they may he 
said with a slight inclination of her head natásha stepped back quickly to mávra kuzmínichna 
who stood talking compassionately to the officer may he says they may whispered natásha the 
cart in which the officer lay was turned into the yard and dozens of carts 
with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards 
and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in povarskáya street natásha was 
evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life 
she and mávra kuzmínichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into 
their yard papa must be told though said mávra kuzmínichna mind never mind what does 
it matter for one day we can move into the drawing room they can have 
all our half of the house now young lady you do take things into your 
head even if we put them into the wing the room or the room we 
must ask permission ask natásha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the 
half open door into the sitting room where there was a smell of vinegar and 
drops you asleep mamma what said the countess waking up just as she was dropping 
into a doze darling said natásha kneeling by her mother and bringing her face close 
to her am sorry forgive me never do it again i woke you up mávra 
kuzmínichna has sent me they have brought some wounded will you let them come they 
have nowhere to go i knew let them come she said quickly all in one 
breath officers whom have they brought i understand anything about it said the countess natásha 
laughed and the countess too smiled slightly knew give permission so tell them and having 
kissed her mother natásha got up and went to the door in the hall she 
met her father who had returned with bad news stayed too long said the count 
with involuntary vexation club is closed and the police are leaving is it all invited 
some of the wounded into the house said natásha course it is he answered absently 
not the point i beg you not to indulge in trifles now but to help 
to pack and tomorrow we must go go go and the count gave a similar 
order to the major domo and the servants at dinner pétya having returned home told 
them the news he had heard he said the people had been getting arms in 
the krémlin and that though broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two 
or three days in advance the order had certainly already been given for everyone to 
go armed to the three hills tomorrow and that there would be a big battle 
there the countess looked with timid horror at her eager excited face as he said 
this she realized that if she said a word about his not going to the 
battle she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement he would say something 
about men honor and the senseless masculine and obstinate which there would be no contradicting 
and her plans would be spoiled and so hoping to arrange to leave before then 
and take pétya with her as their protector and defender she did not answer him 
but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take her 
away quickly that very night if possible with a involuntary loving cunning she who till 
then had not shown any alarm said that she would die of fright if they 
did not leave that very night without any pretense she was now afraid of everything 
chapter xiv madame schoss who had been out to visit her daughter increased the fears 
still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit in myasnítski street when 
returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd 
rioting in front of the shop she had taken a cab and driven home by 
a side street and the cabman had told her that the people were breaking open 
the barrels at the drink store having received orders to do so after dinner the 
whole rostóv household set to work with enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for 
their departure the old count suddenly setting to work kept passing from the yard to 
the house and back again shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people and flurrying them 
still more pétya directed things in the yard sónya owing to the contradictory orders lost 
her head and did not know what to do the servants ran noisily about the 
house and yard shouting and disputing natásha with the ardor characteristic of all she did 
suddenly set to work too at first her intervention in the business of packing was 
received skeptically everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to obey her 
but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience grew angry and nearly cried because they did 
not heed her and at last succeeded in making them believe her her first exploit 
which cost her immense effort and established her authority was the packing of the carpets 
the count had valuable gobelin tapestries and persian carpets in the house when natásha set 
to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom one almost full up with 
crockery the other with carpets there was also much china standing on the tables and 
still more was being brought in from the storeroom a third case was needed and 
servants had gone to fetch it wait a pack everything into these said natásha miss 
we have tried to said the assistant wait a minute please and natásha began rapidly 
taking out of the case dishes and plates wrapped in paper dishes must go in 
here among the carpets said she a mercy if we can get the carpets alone 
into three cases said the assistant wait please and natásha began rapidly and deftly sorting 
out the things needed said she putting aside some plates of kiev ware these must 
go among the carpets she said referring to the saxony china dishes natásha leave it 
alone get it all packed urged sónya reproachfully a young lady she is remarked the 
major domo but natásha would not give in she turned everything out and began quickly 
repacking deciding that the inferior russian carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at 
all when everything had been taken out of the cases they recommenced packing and it 
turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected 
the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases only the lid of 
the case containing the carpets would not shut down a few more things might have 
been taken out but natásha insisted on having her own way she packed repacked pressed 
made the assistant and she had drawn into the business of on the lid and 
made desperate efforts herself enough natásha said sónya see you were right but just take 
out the top one cried natásha with one hand holding back the hair that hung 
over her perspiring face while with the other she pressed down the carpets press pétya 
press vasílich press hard she cried the carpets yielded and the lid closed natásha clapping 
her hands screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes but this only lasted 
a moment she at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her completely 
the count was not angry even when they told him that natásha had countermanded an 
order of his and the servants now came to her to ask whether a cart 
was sufficiently loaded and whether it might be corded up thanks to directions the work 
now went on expeditiously unnecessary things were left and the most valuable packed as compactly 
as possible but hard as they all worked till quite late that night they could 
not get everything packed the countess had fallen asleep and the count having put off 
their departure till next morning went to bed sónya and natásha slept in the sitting 
room without undressing that night another wounded man was driven down the povarskáya and mávra 
kuzmínichna who was standing at the gate had him brought into the yard mávra kuzmínichna 
concluded that he was a very important man he was being conveyed in a calèche 
with a raised hood and was quite covered by an apron on the box beside 
the driver sat a venerable old attendant a doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage 
in a cart come in here the masters are going away and the whole house 
will be empty said the old woman to the old attendant perhaps said he with 
a sigh expect to get him home alive we have a house of our own 
in moscow but a long way from here and nobody living in it us the 
honor to come in plenty of everything in the house come in said mávra kuzmínichna 
he very ill she asked the attendant made a hopeless gesture expect to get him 
home we must ask the doctor and the old servant got down from the box 
and went up to the cart right said the doctor the old servant returned to 
the calèche looked into it shook his head disconsolately told the driver to turn into 
the yard and stopped beside mávra kuzmínichna lord jesus christ she murmured she invited them 
to take the wounded man into the house masters object she said but they had 
to avoid carrying the man upstairs and so they took him into the wing and 
put him in the room that had been madame this wounded man was prince andrew 
bolkónski chapter xv last day had come it was a clear bright autumn day a 
sunday the church bells everywhere were ringing for service just as usual on sundays nobody 
seemed yet to realize what awaited the city only two things indicated the social condition 
of rabble that is the poor people and the price of commodities an enormous crowd 
of factory hands house serfs and peasants with whom some officials seminarists and gentry were 
mingled had gone early that morning to the three hills having waited there for rostopchín 
who did not turn up they became convinced that moscow would be surrendered and then 
dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops prices too that day 
indicated the state of affairs the price of weapons of gold of carts and horses 
kept rising but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling so that 
by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable goods such as cloth and receiving 
in payment a half of what they carted while peasant horses were fetching five hundred 
rubles each and furniture mirrors and bronzes were being given away for nothing in the 
staid old fashioned house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable 
as to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue 
disappeared during the night but nothing was stolen and as to the value of their 
possessions the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many 
people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money 
for them not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts but on 
the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of september orderlies and 
servants sent by wounded officers came to the and wounded men dragged themselves there from 
the and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated entreating the servants to try to 
get them a lift out of moscow the major domo to whom these entreaties were 
addressed though he was sorry for the wounded resolutely refused saying that he dare not 
even mention the matter to the count pity these wounded men as one might it 
was evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to 
refuse another or all the carts and own carriages as well thirty carts could not 
save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and 
own family so thought the major domo on his behalf on waking up that morning 
count ilyá rostóv left his bedroom softly so as not to wake the countess who 
had fallen asleep only toward morning and came out to the porch in his lilac 
silk dressing gown in the yard stood the carts ready corded the carriages were at 
the front porch the major domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly 
and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm on seeing the count the 
major domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away vasílich 
is everything ready asked the count and stroking his bald head he looked good naturedly 
at the officer and the orderly and nodded to them he liked to see new 
faces can harness at once your excellency right as soon as the countess wakes be 
off god willing what is it gentlemen he added turning to the officer you staying 
in my house the officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson be so 
good as to allow me for sake to get into some corner of one of 
your carts i have nothing here with me i shall be all right on a 
loaded cart before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same request on 
behalf of his master yes yes yes said the count hastily shall be very pleased 
very pleased vasílich see to it just unload one or two carts well what of 
it do necessary said the count muttering some indefinite order but at the same moment 
an expression of warm gratitude on the face had already sealed the order the count 
looked around him in the yard at the gates at the window of the wings 
wounded officers and their orderlies were to be seen they were all looking at the 
count and moving toward the porch step into the gallery your excellency said the major 
domo are your orders about the pictures the count went into the house with him 
repeating his order not to refuse the wounded who asked for a lift never mind 
some of the things can be unloaded he added in a soft confidential voice as 
though afraid of being overheard at nine the countess woke up and matrëna timoféevna who 
had been her maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of chief duty 
for her came to say that madame schoss was much offended and the young summer 
dresses could not be left behind on inquiry the countess learned that madame schoss was 
offended because her trunk had been taken down from its cart and all the loads 
were being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for 
wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they 
should take with them the countess sent for her husband is this my dear i 
hear that the luggage is being unloaded know love i wanted to tell you countess 
dear an officer came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded 
after all ours are things that can be bought but think what being left behind 
means to them really now in our own asked them in ourselves and there are 
officers among them you know i think my dear let them be taken the hurry 
the count spoke timidly as he always did when talking of money matters the countess 
was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of something detrimental to the 
interests such as the building of a new gallery or conservatory the inauguration of a 
private theater or an orchestra she was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that 
timid tone and considered it her duty to do so she assumed her dolefully submissive 
manner and said to her husband to me count you have managed matters so that 
we are getting nothing for the house and now you wish to throw away all 
the property you said yourself that we have a hundred thousand worth of things in 
the house i consent my dear i do as you please the business to look 
after the wounded they know that look at the lopukhíns opposite they cleared out everything 
two days ago what other people do only we who are such fools if you 
have no pity on me have some for the children flourishing his arms in despair 
the count left the room without replying what are you doing that for asked natásha 
who had followed him into her room what business is it of yours muttered the 
count angrily i heard said natásha does mamma object business is it of yours cried 
the count natásha stepped up to the window and pondered berg coming to see us 
said she looking out of the window chapter xvi berg the son in law was 
already a colonel wearing the orders of vladímir and anna and he still filled the 
quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant 
commander of the first division of the second army on the first of september he 
had come to moscow from the army he had nothing to do in moscow but 
he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit moscow 
and had something to do there so he considered it necessary to ask for leave 
of absence for family and domestic reasons berg drove up to his father in house 
in his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek roans exactly like those of 
a certain prince he looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going 
up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in 
it from the anteroom berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the drawing room 
where he embraced the count kissed the hands of natásha and sónya and hastened to 
inquire after health at a time like this said the count tell us the news 
is the army retreating or will there be another battle almighty alone can decide the 
fate of our fatherland papa said berg army is burning with a spirit of heroism 
and the leaders so to say have now assembled in council no one knows what 
is coming but in general i can tell you papa that such a heroic spirit 
the truly antique valor of the russian army which he corrected himself shown or displayed 
in the battle of the twenty are no words worthy to do it justice i 
tell you he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking 
had done but berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his 
breast at the words tell you frankly that we the commanders far from having to 
urge the men on or anything of that kind could hardly restrain those those yes 
those exploits of antique valor he went on rapidly barclay de tolly risked his life 
everywhere at the head of the troops i can assure you our corps was stationed 
on a hillside you can imagine and berg related all that he remembered of the 
various tales he had heard those days natásha watched him with an intent gaze that 
confused him as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to 
some question such heroism as was displayed by the russian warriors cannot be imagined or 
adequately praised said berg glancing round at natásha and as if anxious to conciliate her 
replying to her intent look with a smile is not in moscow she lives in 
the hearts of her sons it so papa said he just then the countess came 
in from the sitting room with a weary and dissatisfied expression berg hurriedly jumped up 
kissed her hand asked about her health and swaying his head from side to side 
to express sympathy remained standing beside her mamma i tell you sincerely that these are 
hard and sad times for every russian but why are you so anxious you have 
still time to get away think what the servants are about said the countess turning 
to her husband have just been told that nothing is ready yet somebody after all 
must see to things one misses mítenka at such times there be any end to 
it the count was about to say something but evidently restrained himself he got up 
from his chair and went to the door at that moment berg drew out his 
handkerchief as if to blow his nose and seeing the knot in it pondered shaking 
his head sadly and significantly i have a great favor to ask of you papa 
said he said the count and stopped was driving past house just now said berg 
with a laugh the steward a man i know ran out and asked me whether 
i buy something i went in out of curiosity you know and there is a 
small chiffonier and a dressing table you know how dear véra wanted a chiffonier like 
that and how we had a dispute about it at the mention of the chiffonier 
and dressing table berg involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable 
domestic arrangements such a beauty it pulls out and has a secret english drawer you 
know and dear véra has long wanted one i wish to give her a surprise 
you see i saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard please let 
me have one i will pay the man well and the count frowned and coughed 
the countess i give orders inconvenient please said berg i so wanted it for dear 
sake go to the devil all of you to the devil the devil the devil 
cried the old count in a whirl and he left the room the countess began 
to cry mamma yes these are very hard times said berg natásha left the room 
with her father and as if finding it difficult to reach some decision first followed 
him and then ran downstairs pétya was in the porch engaged in giving out weapons 
to the servants who were to leave moscow the loaded carts were still standing in 
the yard two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into 
one of them helped by an orderly you know what about pétya asked natásha she 
understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about she did not answer because 
papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded said pétya told me 
i consider consider natásha suddenly almost shouted turning her angry face to pétya consider it 
so horrid so abominable so i know what are we despicable germans her throat quivered 
with convulsive sobs and afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run 
to waste she turned and rushed headlong up the stairs berg was sitting beside the 
countess consoling her with the respectful attention of a relative the count pipe in hand 
was pacing up and down the room when natásha her face distorted by anger burst 
in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps horrid abominable she screamed 
possibly have ordered it berg and the countess looked at her perplexed and frightened the 
count stood still at the window and listened impossible see what is going on in 
the yard she cried will be left the matter with you who are what do 
you want the wounded impossible mamma monstrous no mamma darling not the thing please forgive 
me darling mamma what does it matter what we take away only look what is 
going on in the yard mamma impossible the count stood by the window and listened 
without turning round suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window the 
countess glanced at her daughter saw her face full of shame for her mother saw 
her agitation and understood why her husband did not turn to look at her now 
and she glanced round quite disconcerted do as you like am i hindering anyone she 
said not surrendering at once darling forgive me but the countess pushed her daughter away 
and went up to her husband dear you order what is right you know i 
understand about it said she dropping her eyes shamefacedly eggs the eggs are teaching the 
hen muttered the count through tears of joy and he embraced his wife who was 
glad to hide her look of shame on his breast mamma may i see to 
it may i asked natásha will still take all the most necessary things the count 
nodded affirmatively and natásha at the rapid pace at which she used to run when 
playing at tag ran through the ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard 
the servants gathered round natásha but could not believe the strange order she brought them 
until the count himself in his name confirmed the order to give up all the 
carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms when they understood that 
order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal it 
no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing 
that could be done just as a quarter of an hour before it had not 
seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted 
away but that had seemed the only thing to do the whole household as if 
to atone for not having done it sooner set eagerly to work at the new 
task of placing the wounded in the carts the wounded dragged themselves out of their 
rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts the news that carts 
were to be had spread to the neighboring houses from which wounded men began to 
come into the yard many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts 
but only to let them sit on the top of the things but the work 
of unloading once started could not be arrested it seemed not to matter whether all 
or only half the things were left behind cases full of china bronzes pictures and 
mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard 
and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that 
and letting the wounded have another and yet another cart can take four more men 
said the steward can have my trap or else what is to become of them 
them have my wardrobe cart said the countess can go with me in the carriage 
they unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a house 
two doors off the whole household servants included was bright and animated natásha was in 
a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not known for a long time 
could we fasten this onto asked the servants trying to fix a trunk on the 
narrow footboard behind a carriage must keep at least one cart in it asked natásha 
books it vasílich will put it away not wanted the phaeton was full of people 
and there was a doubt as to where count peter could sit the box sit 
on the box you pétya cried natásha sónya too was busy all this time but 
the aim of her efforts was quite different from she was putting away the things 
that had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess 
wished and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible chapter 
xvii before two in the afternoon the four carriages packed full and with the horses 
harnessed stood at the front door one by one the carts with the wounded had 
moved out of the yard the calèche in which prince andrew was being taken attracted 
attention as it passed the front porch with the help of a maid she was 
arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the 
entrance calèche is that she inquired leaning out of the carriage window you know miss 
replied the maid wounded prince he spent the night in our house and is going 
with us who is it his name our intended that bolkónski himself they say he 
is dying replied the maid with a sigh sónya jumped out of the coach and 
ran to the countess the countess tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet 
for her journey was pacing up and down the drawing room waiting for the household 
to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting natásha was not 
in the room said sónya andrew is here mortally wounded he is going with us 
the countess opened her eyes in dismay and seizing arm glanced around she murmured at 
that moment this news had only one significance for both of them they knew their 
natásha and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this news stifled all 
sympathy for the man they both liked does not know yet but he is going 
with us said sónya say he is dying sónya nodded the countess put her arms 
around sónya and began to cry ways of god are past finding out she thought 
feeling that the almighty hand hitherto unseen was becoming manifest in all that was now 
taking place mamma everything is ready the matter asked natásha as with animated face she 
ran into the room answered the countess everything is ready let us start and the 
countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face sónya embraced natásha and kissed 
her natásha looked at her inquiringly is it what has happened no it something very 
bad for me what is it persisted natásha with her quick intuition sónya sighed and 
made no reply the count pétya madame schoss mávra kuzmínichna and vasílich came into the 
drawing room and having closed the doors they all sat down and remained for some 
moments silently seated without looking at one another the count was the first to rise 
and with a loud sigh crossed himself before the icon all the others did the 
same then the count embraced mávra kuzmínichna and vasílich who were to remain in moscow 
and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs 
lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words the countess went into the oratory and 
there sónya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left here 
and there hanging on the wall the most precious ones with which some family tradition 
was connected were being taken with them in the porch and in the yard the 
men whom pétya had armed with swords and daggers with trousers tucked inside their high 
boots and with belts and girdles tightened were taking leave of those remaining behind as 
is always the case at a departure much had been forgotten or put in the 
wrong place and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of 
the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in while maids 
rushed with cushions and bundles from the house to the carriages the calèche the phaeton 
and back again always will forget everything said the countess you know i sit like 
that and dunyásha with clenched teeth without replying but with an aggrieved look on her 
face hastily got into the coach to rearrange the seat those servants said the count 
swaying his head efím the old coachman who was the only one the countess trusted 
to drive her sat perched up high on the box and did not so much 
as glance round at what was going on behind him from thirty experience he knew 
it would be some time yet before the order off in name would be given 
him and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once 
or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been forgotten and 
even after that he would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out 
of the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down 
the hill he knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen with 
more patience than the horses especially the near one the chestnut falcon who was pawing 
the ground and champing his bit at last all were seated the carriage steps were 
folded and pulled up the door was shut somebody was sent for a traveling case 
and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say then efím deliberately 
doffed his hat and began crossing himself the postilion and all the other servants did 
the same in name said efím putting on his hat the postilion started the horses 
the off pole horse tugged at his collar the high springs creaked and the body 
of the coach swayed the footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which 
jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway the other vehicles 
jolted in their turn and the procession of carriages moved up the street in the 
carriages the calèche and the phaeton all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite 
the house those who were to remain in moscow walked on either side of the 
vehicles seeing the travelers off rarely had natásha experienced so joyful a feeling as now 
sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of 
forsaken agitated moscow occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and 
then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them almost at the 
head of the line she could see the raised hood of prince calèche she did 
not know who was in it but each time she looked at the procession her 
eyes sought that calèche she knew it was right in front in kúdrino from the 
nikítski présnya and podnovínsk streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the and 
as they passed along the sadóvaya street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast 
as they were going round the súkharev water tower natásha who was inquisitively and alertly 
scrutinizing the people driving or walking past suddenly cried out in joyful surprise me mamma 
sónya look he who yes on my word bezúkhov said natásha putting her head out 
of the carriage and staring at a tall stout man in a long coat who 
from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise and who 
was passing under the arch of the súkharev tower accompanied by a small sallow faced 
beardless old man in a frieze coat it really is bezúkhov in a coat with 
a queer looking old boy really said natásha look not he how can you talk 
such nonsense screamed natásha stake my head he i assure you stop stop she cried 
to the coachman but the coachman could not stop for from the meshchánski street came 
more carts and carriages and the rostóvs were being shouted at to move on and 
not block the way in fact however though now much farther off than before the 
rostóvs all saw someone extraordinarily like a coat going down the street with head bent 
and a serious face beside a small beardless old man who looked like a footman 
that old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them 
and respectfully touching elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage pierre evidently 
engrossed in thought could not at first understand him at length when he had understood 
and looked in the direction the old man indicated he recognized natásha and following his 
first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach but having taken a dozen steps 
he seemed to remember something and stopped face leaning out of the window beamed with 
quizzical kindliness kirílovich come here we have recognized you this is wonderful she cried holding 
out her hand to him are you doing why are you like this pierre took 
her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the 
coach still moved on is the matter count asked the countess in a surprised and 
commiserating tone what why ask me said pierre and looked round at natásha whose radiant 
happy which he was conscious without looking at him with enchantment you remaining in moscow 
then pierre hesitated moscow he said in a questioning tone in moscow good by if 
only i were a man certainly stay with you how splendid said natásha if let 
me stay pierre glanced absently at natásha and was about to say something but the 
countess interrupted him were at the battle we heard i was pierre answered will be 
another battle tomorrow he began but natásha interrupted him what is the matter with you 
count you are not like yourself ask me ask me i know myself tomorrow but 
no good by good by he muttered an awful time and dropping behind the carriage 
he stepped onto the pavement natásha continued to lean out of the window for a 
long time beaming at him with her kindly slightly quizzical happy smile chapter xviii for 
the last two days ever since leaving home pierre had been living in the empty 
house of his deceased benefactor bazdéev this is how it happened when he woke up 
on the morning after his return to moscow and his interview with count rostopchín he 
could not for some time make out where he was and what was expected of 
him when he was informed that among others awaiting him in his reception room there 
was a frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife the countess hélène he 
felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which he was apt 
to succumb he felt that everything was now at an end all was in confusion 
and crumbling to pieces that nobody was right or wrong the future held nothing and 
there was no escape from this position smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself he first 
sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair then rose went to the 
door of the reception room and peeped through the crack returned flourishing his arms and 
took up a book his major domo came in a second time to say that 
the frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see 
him if only for a minute and that someone from widow had called to ask 
pierre to take charge of her books as she herself was leaving for the country 
yes in a minute wait or no no of course go and say i will 
come directly pierre replied to the major domo but as soon as the man had 
left the room pierre took up his hat which was lying on the table and 
went out of his study by the other door there was no one in the 
passage he went along the whole length of this passage to the stairs and frowning 
and rubbing his forehead with both hands went down as far as the first landing 
the hall porter was standing at the front door from the landing where pierre stood 
there was a second staircase leading to the back entrance he went down that staircase 
and out into the yard no one had seen him but there were some carriages 
waiting and as soon as pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the 
yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him when he felt he was 
being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush 
in order not to be seen he hung his head and quickening his pace went 
down the street of all the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of joseph 
books and papers appeared to him the most necessary he hired the first cab he 
met and told the driver to go to the ponds where the widow house was 
continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were making their 
way from all sides out of moscow and balancing his bulky body so as not 
to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle pierre experiencing the joyful feeling of a 
boy escaping from school began to talk to his driver the man told him that 
arms were being distributed today at the krémlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent 
out beyond the three hills gates and a great battle would be fought there having 
reached the ponds pierre found the house where he had not been for a long 
time past he went up to the gate gerásim that sallow beardless old man pierre 
had seen at torzhók five years before with joseph bazdéev came out in answer to 
his knock home asked pierre to the present state of things sophia danílovna has gone 
to the torzhók estate with the children your excellency will come in all the same 
i have to look through the books said pierre so good as to step in 
makár alexéevich the brother of my late the kingdom of heaven be remained here but 
he is in a weak state as you know said the old servant pierre knew 
that makár alexéevich was joseph half insane brother and a hard drinker yes i know 
let us go in said pierre and entered the house a tall bald headed old 
man with a red nose wearing a dressing gown and with galoshes on his bare 
feet stood in the anteroom on seeing pierre he muttered something angrily and went away 
along the passage was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble as 
your honor sees said gerásim you step into the study pierre nodded it was sealed 
up so it has remained but sophia danílovna gave orders that if anyone should come 
from you they were to have the books pierre went into that gloomy study which 
he had entered with such trepidation in his lifetime the room dusty and untouched since 
the death of joseph bazdéev was now even gloomier gerásim opened one of the shutters 
and left the room on tiptoe pierre went round the study approached the cupboard in 
which the manuscripts were kept and took out what had once been one of the 
most important the holy of holies of the order this was the authentic scotch acts 
with notes and explanations he sat down at the dusty writing table and having laid 
the manuscripts before him opened them out closed them finally pushed them away and resting 
his head on his hand sank into meditation gerásim looked cautiously into the study several 
times and saw pierre always sitting in the same attitude more than two hours passed 
and gerásim took the liberty of making a slight noise at the door to attract 
his attention but pierre did not hear him the cabman to be discharged your honor 
yes said pierre rousing himself and rising hurriedly here he added taking gerásim by a 
button of his coat and looking down at the old man with moist shining and 
ecstatic eyes say do you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow 
heard so replied the man beg you not to tell anyone who i am and 
to do what i ask you your excellency replied gerásim you have something to eat 
but i want something else i want peasant clothes and a pistol said pierre unexpectedly 
blushing your excellency said gerásim after thinking for a moment all the rest of that 
day pierre spent alone in his study and gerásim heard him pacing restlessly from one 
corner to another and talking to himself and he spent the night on a bed 
made up for him there gerásim being a servant who in his time had seen 
many strange things accepted taking up his residence in the house without surprise and seemed 
pleased to have someone to wait on that same even asking himself what they were 
wanted procured a coat and cap for pierre and promised to get him the pistol 
next day makár alexéevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far 
as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at pierre but as soon as pierre 
turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry 
look and hurried away it was when pierre wearing the coat which gerásim had procured 
for him and had disinfected by steam was on his way with the old man 
to buy the pistol at the súkharev market that he met the rostóvs chapter xix 
order to retreat through moscow to the ryazán road was issued at night on the 
first of september the first troops started at once and during the night they marched 
slowly and steadily without hurry at daybreak however those nearing the town at the dorogomílov 
bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge ascending 
on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys while endless masses of troops 
were bearing down on them from behind and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them 
they all rushed forward to the bridge onto it and to the fords and the 
boats kutúzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of moscow 
by ten in the morning of the second of september only the rear guard remained 
in the dorogomílov suburb where they had ample room the main army was on the 
other side of moscow or beyond it at that very time at ten in the 
morning of the second of september napoleon was standing among his troops on the poklónny 
hill looking at the panorama spread out before him from the twenty sixth of august 
to the second of september that is from the battle of borodinó to the entry 
of the french into moscow during the whole of that agitating memorable week there had 
been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise when the sun hangs 
low and gives more heat than in spring when everything shines so brightly in the 
rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by 
inhaling the aromatic autumn air when even the nights are warm and when in those 
dark warm nights golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling from the sky 
at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather still held the 
brightness of the morning was magical moscow seen from the poklónny hill lay spaciously spread 
out with her river her gardens and her churches and she seemed to be living 
her usual life her cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight the view of the 
strange city with its peculiar architecture such as he had never seen before filled napoleon 
with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form 
of life that has no knowledge of them this city was evidently living with the 
full force of its own life by the indefinite signs which even at a distance 
distinguish a living body from a dead one napoleon from the poklónny hill perceived the 
throb of life in the town and felt as it were the breathing of that 
great and beautiful body every russian looking at moscow feels her to be a mother 
every foreigner who sees her even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city 
must feel her feminine character and napoleon felt it ville asiatique aux innombrables églises moscou 
la sainte la voilà donc enfin cette fameuse ville il était temps said he and 
dismounting he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before him and summoned 
lelorgne the interpreter asiatic city of the innumerable churches holy moscow here it is then 
at last that famous city it was high time town captured by the enemy is 
like a maid who has lost her honor thought he he had said so to 
túchkov at smolénsk from that point of view he gazed at the oriental beauty he 
had not seen before it seemed strange to him that his long felt wish which 
had seemed unattainable had at last been realized in the clear morning light he gazed 
now at the city and now at the plan considering its details and the assurance 
of possessing it agitated and awed him could it be otherwise he thought is this 
capital at my feet where is alexander now and of what is he thinking a 
strange beautiful and majestic city and a strange and majestic moment in what light must 
i appear to them thought he thinking of his troops she is the reward for 
all those fainthearted men he reflected glancing at those near him and at the troops 
who were approaching and forming up word from me one movement of my hand and 
that ancient capital of the tsars would perish but my clemency is always ready to 
descend upon the vanquished i must be magnanimous and truly great but no it be 
true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought here she is lying at my 
feet with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine but i 
shall spare her on the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great 
words of justice and mercy it is just this which alexander will feel most painfully 
i know him it seemed to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking 
place lay in the personal struggle between himself and alexander the height of the there 
is the krémlin will give them just laws i will teach them the meaning of 
true civilization i will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love i will 
tell the deputation that i did not and do not desire war that i have 
waged war only against the false policy of their court that i love and respect 
alexander and that in moscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and 
of my people i do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate 
an honored monarch i will say to them do not desire war i desire the 
peace and welfare of all my subjects however i know their presence will inspire me 
and i shall speak to them as i always do clearly impressively and majestically but 
can it be true that i am in moscow yes there she lies les boyars 
said he to his suite the boyars to me a general with a brilliant suite 
galloped off at once to fetch the boyars two hours passed napoleon had lunched and 
was again standing in the same place on the poklónny hill awaiting the deputation his 
speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination that speech was 
full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it he was himself carried away by 
the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward moscow in his imagination he appointed 
days for assemblies at the palace of the tsars at which russian notables and his 
own would mingle he mentally appointed a governor one who would win the hearts of 
the people having learned that there were many charitable institutions in moscow he mentally decided 
that he would shower favors on them all he thought that as in africa he 
had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque so in moscow he 
must be beneficent like the tsars and in order finally to touch the hearts of 
the being like all frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference to ma 
chère ma tendre ma pauvre mère decided that he would place an inscription on all 
these establishments in large letters establishment is dedicated to my dear mother or no it 
should be simply maison de ma mère 2 he concluded am i really in moscow 
yes here it lies before me but why is the deputation from the city so 
long in appearing he wondered dear my tender my poor mother 2 of my mother 
meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals 
at the rear of his suite those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with 
the news that moscow was empty that everyone had left it the faces of those 
who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed they were not alarmed by the 
fact that moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants grave as that fact seemed but 
by the question how to tell the putting him in the terrible position of appearing 
he had been awaiting the boyars so long in vain that there were drunken mobs 
left in moscow but no one else some said that a deputation of some sort 
must be scraped together others disputed that opinion and maintained that the emperor should first 
be carefully and skillfully prepared and then told the truth will have to be told 
all the same said some gentlemen of the suite gentlemen the position was the more 
awkward because the emperor meditating upon his magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down 
before the outspread map occasionally glancing along the road to moscow from under his lifted 
hand with a bright and proud smile impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite shrugging 
their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied ridicule at last the emperor tired 
of futile expectation his instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too 
long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity gave a sign with his hand 
a single report of a signaling gun followed and the troops who were already spread 
out on different sides of moscow moved into the city through the tver kalúga and 
dorogomílov gates faster and faster vying with one another they moved at the double or 
at a trot vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air 
ring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts drawn on by the movement of his 
troops napoleon rode with them as far as the dorogomílov gate but there again stopped 
and dismounting from his horse paced for a long time by the kámmer kollézski rampart 
awaiting the deputation chapter xx meanwhile moscow was empty there were still people in it 
perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained but it was empty it 
was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty in a queenless 
hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive 
as other hives the bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of 
the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives from a distance it smells 
of honey like the others and bees fly in and out in the same way 
but one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer 
any life in it the bees do not fly in the same way the smell 
and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same to the tap on 
the wall of the sick hive instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens 
of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed and producing by the rapid vibration 
of their wings an aerial living sound the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from 
different parts of the deserted hive from the alighting board instead of the former spirituous 
fragrant smell of honey and venom and the warm whiffs of crowded life comes an 
odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey there are no longer 
sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised and ready to die in defense of 
the hive there is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity like the 
sound of boiling water but diverse discordant sounds of disorder in and out of the 
hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily they do not 
sting but crawl away from danger formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the 
hive and they flew out empty now they fly out laden the beekeeper opens the 
lower part of the hive and peers in instead of black glossy by toil clinging 
to one legs and drawing out the wax with a ceaseless hum of used to 
hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive drowsy shriveled bees crawl 
about separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive instead of 
a neatly glued floor swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings there 
is a floor littered with bits of wax excrement dying bees scarcely moving their legs 
and dead ones that have not been cleared away the beekeeper opens the upper part 
of the hive and examines the super instead of serried rows of bees sealing up 
every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm he sees the skillful complex 
structures of the combs but no longer in their former state of purity all is 
neglected and foul black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs and 
the short home bees shriveled and listless as if they were old creep slowly about 
without trying to hinder the robbers having lost all motive and all sense of life 
drones bumblebees wasps and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their 
flight here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing 
can sometimes be heard here and there a couple of bees by force of habit 
and custom cleaning out the brood cells with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away 
a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it in another corner two 
old bees are languidly fighting or cleaning themselves or feeding one another without themselves knowing 
whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent in a third place a crowd 
of bees crushing one another attack some victim and fight and smother it and the 
victim enfeebled or killed drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather among the 
heap of corpses the keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells 
in place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back 
to back and guarding the high mystery of generation he sees hundreds of dull listless 
and sleepy shells of bees they have almost all died unawares sitting in the sanctuary 
they had guarded and which is now no more they reek of decay and death 
only a few of them still move rise and feebly fly to settle on the 
hand lacking the spirit to die stinging him the rest are dead and fall as 
lightly as fish scales the beekeeper closes the hive chalks a mark on it and 
when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean so in the 
same way moscow was empty when napoleon weary uneasy and morose paced up and down 
in front of the kámmer kollézski rampart awaiting what to his mind was a necessary 
if but formal observance of the deputation in various corners of moscow there still remained 
a few people aimlessly moving about following their old habits and hardly aware of what 
they were doing when with due circumspection napoleon was informed that moscow was empty he 
looked angrily at his informant turned away and silently continued to walk to and fro 
carriage he said he took his seat beside the aide de camp on duty and 
drove into the suburb deserted he said to himself an incredible event he did not 
drive into the town but put up at an inn in the dorogomílov suburb the 
coup de théâtre had not come off chapter xxi the russian troops were passing through 
moscow from two at night till two in the afternoon and bore away with them 
the wounded and the last of the inhabitants who were leaving the greatest crush during 
the movement of the troops took place at the stone moskvá and yaúza bridges while 
the troops dividing into two parts when passing around the krémlin were thronging the moskvá 
and the stone bridges a great many soldiers taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion 
turned back from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of vasíli 
the beatified and under the borovítski gate back up the hill to the red square 
where some instinct told them they could easily take things not belonging to them crowds 
of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the passages and alleys of the 
bazaar but there were no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter 
there were no hawkers nor the usual motley crowd of female only soldiers in uniforms 
and overcoats though without muskets entering the bazaar empty handed and silently making their way 
out through its passages with bundles tradesmen and their assistants of whom there were but 
few moved about among the soldiers quite bewildered they unlocked their shops and locked them 
up again and themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants on the 
square in front of the bazaar were drummers beating the muster call but the roll 
of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the direction of the 
drum as formerly but made them on the contrary run farther away among the soldiers 
in the shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats with 
closely shaven heads two officers one with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on 
a lean dark gray horse the other in an overcoat and on foot stood at 
the corner of ilyínka street talking a third officer galloped up to them general orders 
them all to be driven out at once without fail this is outrageous half the 
men have dispersed are you off to where he shouted to three infantrymen without muskets 
who holding up the skirts of their overcoats were slipping past him into the bazaar 
passage you rascals how are you going to stop them replied another officer is no 
getting them together the army should push on before the rest bolt all can one 
push on they are stuck there wedged on the bridge and move we put a 
cordon round to prevent the rest from running away go in there and drive them 
out shouted the senior officer the officer in the scarf dismounted called up a drummer 
and went with him into the arcade some soldiers started running away in a group 
a shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose and a calm persistent 
calculating expression on his plump face hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer swinging his arms 
honor said he so good as to protect us we grudge trifles you are welcome 
to shall be delighted pray fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an 
honorable gentleman or even two pieces with pleasure for we feel how it is but 
all robbery if you please could not guards be placed if only to let us 
close the shop several shopkeepers crowded round the officer what twaddle said one of them 
a thin stern looking man head is gone one weep for hair take what any 
of you like and flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the officer all 
very well for you iván sidórych to talk said the first tradesman angrily step inside 
your honor indeed cried the thin one my three shops here i have a hundred 
thousand worth of goods can they be saved when the army has gone eh what 
people might our hands fight inside your honor repeated the tradesman bowing the officer stood 
perplexed and his face showed indecision not my business he exclaimed and strode on quickly 
down one of the passages from one open shop came the sound of blows and 
vituperation and just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray 
coat with a shaven head was flung out violently this man bent double rushed past 
the tradesman and the officer the officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the 
shops but at that moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the 
moskvá bridge and the officer ran out into the square is it what is it 
he asked but his comrade was already galloping off past vasíli the beatified in the 
direction from which the screams came the officer mounted his horse and rode after him 
when he reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns the infantry crossing the bridge 
several overturned carts and frightened and laughing faces among the troops beside the cannon a 
cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed four borzois with collars were pressing 
close to the wheels the cart was loaded high and at the very top beside 
a chair with its legs in the air sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and 
desperate shrieks he was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd 
and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that general ermólov coming 
up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds 
of civilians blocked the bridge had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a 
show of firing at the bridge the crowd crushing one another upsetting carts and shouting 
and squeezing desperately had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward 
chapter xxii meanwhile the city itself was deserted there was hardly anyone in the streets 
the gates and shops were all closed only here and there round the taverns solitary 
shouts or drunken songs could be heard nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were 
rarely heard the povarskáya was quite still and deserted the huge courtyard of the house 
was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the horses and not a 
soul was to be seen there in the great drawing room of the house which 
had been left with all it contained were two people they were the yard porter 
ignát and the page boy míshka grandson who had stayed in moscow with his grandfather 
míshka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with one finger the yard 
porter his arms akimbo stood smiling with satisfaction before the large mirror it fine eh 
uncle ignát said the boy suddenly beginning to strike the keyboard with both hands fancy 
answered ignát surprised at the broadening grin on his face in the mirror impudence they 
heard behind them the voice of mávra kuzmínichna who had entered silently grinning the fat 
mug is that what here for cleared away down there and vasílich is worn out 
just you wait a bit ignát left off smiling adjusted his belt and went out 
of the room with meekly downcast eyes i did it gently said the boy give 
you something gently you monkey you cried mávra kuzmínichna raising her arm threateningly and get 
the samovar to boil for your grandfather mávra kuzmínichna flicked the dust off the clavichord 
and closed it and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its 
main door going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go 
drink tea in the wing with vasílich or into the storeroom to put away what 
still lay about she heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street someone 
stopped at the gate and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it mávra 
kuzmínichna went to the gate do you want ilyá andréevich rostóv who are you officer 
i have to see him came the reply in a pleasant well bred russian voice 
mávra kuzmínichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen with the round face of 
a rostóv entered the yard have gone away sir went away yesterday at vespertime said 
mávra kuzmínichna cordially the young officer standing in the gateway as if hesitating whether to 
enter or not clicked his tongue how annoying he muttered should have come yesterday ah 
what a pity meanwhile mávra kuzmínichna was attentively and sympathetically examining the familiar rostóv features 
of the young face his tattered coat and trodden down boots did you want to 
see the count for she asked well it be helped said he in a tone 
of vexation and placed his hand on the gate as if to leave he again 
paused in indecision see he suddenly said am a kinsman of the and he has 
been very kind to me as you he glanced with an amused air and good 
natured smile at his coat and boots things are worn out and i have no 
money so i was going to ask the count mávra kuzmínichna did not let him 
finish wait a minute sir one little moment said she and as soon as the 
officer let go of the gate handle she turned and hurrying away on her old 
legs went through the back yard to the quarters while mávra kuzmínichna was running to 
her room the officer walked about the yard gazing at his worn out boots with 
lowered head and a faint smile on his lips a pity missed uncle what a 
nice old woman where has she run off to and how am i to find 
the nearest way to overtake my regiment which must by now be getting near the 
rogózhski gate thought he just then mávra kuzmínichna appeared from behind the corner of the 
house with a frightened yet resolute look carrying a rolled up check kerchief in her 
hand while still a few steps from the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took 
out of it a white twenty five ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him 
his excellency had been at home as a kinsman he would of course but as 
it is mávra kuzmínichna grew abashed and confused the officer did not decline but took 
the note quietly and thanked her the count had been at home mávra kuzmínichna went 
on apologetically be with you sir may god preserve you said she bowing as she 
saw him out swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself the officer 
ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the yaúza bridge to overtake 
his regiment but mávra kuzmínichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist 
eyes pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of motherly tenderness and pity 
for the unknown young officer chapter xxiii from an unfinished house on the varvárka the 
ground floor of which was a dramshop came drunken shouts and songs on benches round 
the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands tipsy and perspiring 
with dim eyes and wide open mouths they were all laboriously singing some song or 
other they were singing discordantly arduously and with great effort evidently not because they wished 
to sing but because they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree 
one a tall fair haired lad in a clean blue coat was standing over the 
others his face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not 
been for his thin compressed twitching lips and dull gloomy fixed eyes evidently possessed by 
some idea he stood over those who were singing and solemnly and jerkily flourished above 
their heads his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow trying unnaturally 
to spread out his dirty fingers the sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and 
he always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand as if it were 
most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare in the 
midst of the song cries were heard and fighting and blows in the passage and 
porch the tall lad waved his arm it he exclaimed peremptorily a fight lads and 
still rolling up his sleeve he went out to the porch the factory hands followed 
him these men who under the leadership of the tall lad were drinking in the 
dramshop that morning had brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this 
had had drink served them the blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy hearing the sounds of 
revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into wished to force 
their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted the publican was 
fighting one of the smiths at the door and when the workmen came out the 
smith wrenching himself free from the tavern keeper fell face downward on the pavement another 
smith tried to enter the doorway pressing against the publican with his chest the lad 
with the turned up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and cried 
wildly fighting us lads at that moment the first smith got up and scratching his 
bruised face to make it bleed shouted in a tearful voice murder killed a man 
lads gracious me a man beaten to screamed a woman coming out of a gate 
close by a crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith you robbed people their last shirts 
said a voice addressing the publican have you killed a man for you thief the 
tall lad standing in the porch turned his bleared eyes from the publican to the 
smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to fight now he shouted 
suddenly to the publican him lads daresay you would like to bind me shouted the 
publican pushing away the men advancing on him and snatching his cap from his head 
he flung it on the ground as if this action had some mysterious and menacing 
significance the workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision know the law very well mates 
take the matter to the captain of police you think i get to him robbery 
is not permitted to anybody nowadays shouted the publican picking up his cap along then 
come along then the publican and the tall young fellow repeated one after the other 
and they moved up the street together the bloodstained smith went beside them the factory 
hands and others followed behind talking and shouting at the corner of the moroséyka opposite 
a large house with closed shutters and bearing a signboard stood a score of thin 
worn out gloomy faced bootmakers wearing overalls and long tattered coats should pay folks off 
properly a thin workingman with frowning brows and a straggly beard was saying sucked our 
blood and now he thinks quit of us been misleading us all the week and 
now that brought us to this pass made off on seeing the crowd and the 
bloodstained man the workman ceased speaking and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the 
moving crowd are all the folks going to the police of course say is it 
true that we have been beaten what did you think look what folks are saying 
questions and answers were heard the publican taking advantage of the increased crowd dropped behind 
and returned to his tavern the tall youth not noticing the disappearance of his foe 
waved his bare arm and went on talking incessantly attracting general attention to himself it 
was around him that the people chiefly crowded expecting answers from him to the questions 
that occupied all their minds must keep order keep the law what the government is 
there for am i not right good christians said the tall youth with a scarcely 
perceptible smile thinks no government how can one do without government or else there would 
be plenty rob us talk nonsense rejoined voices in the crowd they give up moscow 
like this they told you that for fun and you believed it there plenty of 
troops on the march let him in indeed what the government is for better listen 
to what people are saying said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth 
by the wall of china town a smaller group of people were gathered round a 
man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand ukáse they are 
reading an ukáse reading an ukáse cried voices in the crowd and the people rushed 
toward the reader the man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of august 
31 when the crowd collected round him he seemed confused but at the demand of 
the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him he began in a 
rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning tomorrow i shall go to 
his serene highness he read highness said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on 
his lips and a frown on his brow consult with him to act and to 
aid the army to exterminate these scoundrels we too will take part the reader went 
on and then paused you see shouted the youth victoriously going to clear up the 
whole affair for you destroying them and will send these visitors to the devil i 
will come back to dinner and set to work we will do completely do and 
undo these scoundrels the last words were read out in the midst of complete silence 
the tall lad hung his head gloomily it was evident that no one had understood 
the last part in particular the words will come back to dinner evidently displeased both 
reader and audience the minds were tuned to a high pitch and this was too 
simple and needlessly was what any one of them might have said and therefore was 
what an ukáse emanating from the highest authority should not say they all stood despondent 
and silent the tall youth moved his lips and swayed from side to side should 
ask him he himself ask him indeed why not voices in the rear of the 
crowd were suddenly heard saying and the general attention turned to the police trap which 
drove into the square attended by two mounted dragoons the superintendent of police who had 
gone that morning by count orders to burn the barges and had in connection with 
that matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his 
pocket on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to stop people 
are these he shouted to the men who were moving singly and timidly in the 
direction of his trap people are these he shouted again receiving no answer honor replied 
the shopman in the frieze coat honor in accord with the proclamation of his highest 
excellency the count they desire to serve not sparing their lives and it is not 
any kind of riot but as his highest excellence said count has not left he 
is here and an order will be issued concerning you said the superintendent of police 
on he ordered his coachman the crowd halted pressing around those who had heard what 
the superintendent had said and looking at the departing trap the superintendent of police turned 
round at that moment with a scared look said something to his coachman and his 
horses increased their speed a fraud lads lead the way to him himself shouted the 
tall youth let him go lads let him answer us keep him shouted different people 
and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap following the superintendent of police and 
talking loudly the crowd went in the direction of the lubyánka street now the gentry 
and merchants have gone away and left us to perish do they think dogs voices 
in the crowd were heard saying more and more frequently chapter xxiv on the evening 
of the first of september after his interview with kutúzov count rostopchín had returned to 
moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of 
war and because kutúzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in 
the defense of the city amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at 
the camp which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not 
merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters distressed offended and surprised by all this 
rostopchín had returned to moscow after supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing 
and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from kutúzov 
this letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops through the 
town as the army was retreating to the ryazán road beyond moscow this was not 
news to rostopchín he had known that moscow would be abandoned not merely since his 
interview the previous day with kutúzov on the poklónny hill but ever since the battle 
of borodinó for all the generals who came to moscow after that battle had said 
unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle and since then the government property 
had been removed every night and half the inhabitants had left the city with own 
permission yet all the same this information astonished and irritated the count coming as it 
did in the form of a simple note with an order from kutúzov and received 
at night breaking in on his beauty sleep when later on in his memoirs count 
rostopchín explained his actions at this time he repeatedly says that he was then actuated 
by two important considerations to maintain tranquillity in moscow and expedite the departure of the 
inhabitants if one accepts this twofold aim all actions appear irreproachable were the holy relics 
the arms ammunition gunpowder and stores of corn not removed why were thousands of inhabitants 
deceived into believing that moscow would not be given thereby ruined preserve the tranquillity of 
the city explains count rostopchín were bundles of useless papers from the government offices and 
balloon and other articles removed leave the town empty explains count rostopchín one need only 
admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification all the 
horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for public tranquillity on 
what then was count fear for the tranquillity of moscow based in 1812 what reason 
was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city the inhabitants were 
leaving it and the retreating troops were filling it why should that cause the masses 
to riot neither in moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever 
occur when the enemy entered a town more than ten thousand people were still in 
moscow on the first and second of september and except for a mob in the 
courtyard assembled there at his bidding nothing happened it is obvious that there would have 
been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle 
of borodinó when the surrender of moscow became certain or at least probable rostopchín instead 
of exciting the people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all 
the holy relics the gunpowder munitions and money and had told the population plainly that 
the town would be abandoned rostopchín though he had patriotic sentiments was a sanguine and 
impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding 
at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding ever since the entry 
into smolénsk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular 
feeling of heart of russia not only did it seem to him as to all 
administrators that he controlled the external actions of inhabitants but he also thought he controlled 
their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters written in a coarse tone 
which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in 
authority rostopchín was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling and 
had grown so used to it that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning 
moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip 
away from under his feet so that he positively did not know what to do 
though he knew it was coming he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe 
that moscow would be abandoned and did not prepare for it the inhabitants left against 
his wishes if the government offices were removed this was only done on the demand 
of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly he was absorbed in the role he 
had created for himself as is often the case with those gifted with an ardent 
imagination though he had long known that moscow would be abandoned he knew it only 
with his intellect he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt 
himself mentally to this new position of affairs all his painstaking and energetic activity in 
how far it was useful and had any effect on the people is another question 
had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred 
of the french but when events assumed their true historical character when expressing hatred for 
the french in words proved insufficient when it was not even possible to express that 
hatred by fighting a battle when self confidence was of no avail in relation to 
the one question before moscow when the whole population streamed out of moscow as one 
man abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their 
national feeling then the role chosen by rostopchín suddenly appeared senseless he unexpectedly felt himself 
ridiculous weak and alone with no ground to stand on when awakened from his sleep 
he received that cold peremptory note from kutúzov he felt the more irritated the more 
he felt himself to blame all that he had been specially put in charge of 
the state property which he should have removed was still in moscow and it was 
no longer possible to take the whole of it away is to blame for it 
who has let things come to such a pass he ruminated i of course i 
had everything ready i had moscow firmly in hand and this is what they have 
let it come to villains traitors he thought without clearly defining who the villains and 
traitors were but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever they might be who 
were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in which he found himself all 
that night count rostopchín issued orders for which people came to him from all parts 
of moscow those about him had never seen the count so morose and irritable excellency 
the director of the department has sent for instructions from the consistory from the senate 
from the university from the foundling hospital the suffragan has sent asking for information what 
are your orders about the fire brigade from the governor of the prison from the 
superintendent of the lunatic asylum all night long such announcements were continually being received by 
the count to all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that orders 
from him were not now needed that the whole affair carefully prepared by him had 
now been ruined by somebody and that that somebody would have to bear the whole 
responsibility for all that might happen tell that blockhead he said in reply to the 
question from the department he should remain to guard his documents now why are you 
asking silly questions about the fire brigade they have horses let them be off to 
vladímir and not leave them to the french excellency the superintendent of the lunatic asylum 
has come what are your commands commands let them go away all and let the 
lunatics out into the town when lunatics command our armies god evidently means these other 
madmen to be free in reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison 
count rostopchín shouted angrily at the governor you expect me to give you two we 
have not a convoy release them all about it excellency there are some political prisoners 
meshkóv vereshchágin he been hanged yet shouted rostopchín him to me chapter xxv toward nine 
in the morning when the troops were already moving through moscow nobody came to the 
count any more for instructions those who were able to get away were going of 
their own accord those who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do the 
count ordered his carriage that he might drive to sokólniki and sat in his study 
with folded hands morose sallow and taciturn in quiet and untroubled times it seems to 
every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his 
rule is kept going and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the 
chief reward of his labor and efforts while the sea of history remains calm the 
ruler administrator in his frail bark holding on with a boat hook to the ship 
of the people and himself moving naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he 
is holding on to but as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins 
to heave and the ship to move such a delusion is no longer possible the 
ship moves independently with its own enormous motion the boat hook no longer reaches the 
moving vessel and suddenly the administrator instead of appearing a ruler and a source of 
power becomes an insignificant useless feeble man rostopchín felt this and it was this which 
exasperated him the superintendent of police whom the crowd had stopped went in to see 
him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the horses 
were harnessed they were both pale and the superintendent of police after reporting that he 
had executed the instructions he had received informed the count that an immense crowd had 
collected in the courtyard and wished to see him without saying a word rostopchín rose 
and walked hastily to his light luxurious drawing room went to the balcony door took 
hold of the handle let it go again and went to the window from which 
he had a better view of the whole crowd the tall lad was standing in 
front flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look the blood stained smith 
stood beside him with a gloomy face a drone of voices was audible through the 
closed window my carriage ready asked rostopchín stepping back from the window is your excellency 
replied the adjutant rostopchín went again to the balcony door what do they want he 
asked the superintendent of police excellency they say they have got ready according to your 
orders to go against the french and they shouted something about treachery but it is 
a turbulent crowd your hardly managed to get away from it your excellency i venture 
to suggest may go i need you to tell me what to do exclaimed rostopchín 
angrily he stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd is what they have 
done with russia this is what they have done with me thought he full of 
an irrepressible fury that welled up within him against the someone to whom what was 
happening might be attributed as often happens with passionate people he was mastered by anger 
but was still seeking an object on which to vent it is that mob the 
dregs of the people he thought as he gazed at the crowd rabble they have 
roused by their folly they want a victim he thought as he looked at the 
tall lad flourishing his arm and this thought occurred to him just because he himself 
desired a victim something on which to vent his rage the carriage ready he asked 
again your excellency what are your orders about vereshchágin he is waiting at the porch 
said the adjutant exclaimed rostopchín as if struck by an unexpected recollection and rapidly opening 
the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony the talking instantly ceased hats and 
caps were doffed and all eyes were raised to the count morning lads said the 
count briskly and loudly you for coming come out to you in a moment but 
we must first settle with the villain we must punish the villain who has caused 
the ruin of moscow wait for me and the count stepped as briskly back into 
the room and slammed the door behind him a murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran 
through the crowd settle with all the villains see and you said the french show 
you what law is the mob were saying as if reproving one another for their 
lack of confidence a few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front 
door gave an order and the dragoons formed up in line the crowd moved eagerly 
from the balcony toward the porch rostopchín coming out there with quick angry steps looked 
hastily around as if seeking someone is he he inquired and as he spoke he 
saw a young man coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons he 
had a long thin neck and his head that had been half shaved was again 
covered by short hair this young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat 
lined with fox fur that had once been smart and dirty hempen convict trousers over 
which were pulled his thin dirty trodden down boots on his thin weak legs were 
heavy chains which hampered his irresolute movements said rostopchín hurriedly turning away his eyes from 
the young man in the fur lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of 
the porch him there the young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the 
spot indicated holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his neck turned 
his long neck twice this way and that sighed and submissively folded before him his 
thin hands unused to work for several seconds while the young man was taking his 
place on the step the silence continued only among the back rows of the people 
who were all pressing toward the one spot could sighs groans and the shuffling of 
feet be heard while waiting for the young man to take his place on the 
step rostopchín stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand said he with a 
metallic ring in his voice man vereshchágin is the scoundrel by whose doing moscow is 
perishing the young man in the fur lined coat stooping a little stood in a 
submissive attitude his fingers clasped before him his emaciated young face disfigured by the half 
shaven head hung down hopelessly at the first words he raised it slowly and looked 
up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet his 
eye but rostopchín did not look at him a vein in the young long thin 
neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear and suddenly his face 
flushed all eyes were fixed on him he looked at the crowd and rendered more 
hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there he smiled sadly and timidly 
and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step has betrayed his tsar and 
his country he has gone over to bonaparte he alone of all the russians has 
disgraced the russian name he has caused moscow to perish said rostopchín in a sharp 
even voice but suddenly he glanced down at vereshchágin who continued to stand in the 
same submissive attitude as if inflamed by the sight he raised his arm and addressed 
the people almost shouting with him as you think fit i hand him over to 
you the crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one another to 
keep one another back to breathe in that stifling atmosphere to be unable to stir 
and to await something unknown uncomprehended and terrible was becoming unbearable those standing in front 
who had seen and heard what had taken place before them all stood with wide 
open eyes and mouths straining with all their strength and held back the crowd that 
was pushing behind them him let the traitor perish and not disgrace the russian name 
shouted rostopchín him down i command it hearing not so much the words as the 
angry tone of voice the crowd moaned and heaved forward but again paused exclaimed the 
timid yet theatrical voice of vereshchágin in the midst of the momentary silence that ensued 
one god is above us both he lifted his head and again the thick vein 
in his thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in 
his face he did not finish what he wished to say him down i command 
it shouted rostopchín suddenly growing pale like vereshchágin sabers cried the dragoon officer drawing his 
own another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the front ranks carried 
it swaying to the very steps of the porch the tall youth with a stony 
look on his face and rigid and uplifted arm stood beside vereshchágin him the dragoon 
officer almost whispered and one of the soldiers his face all at once distorted with 
fury struck vereshchágin on the head with the blunt side of his saber cried vereshchágin 
in meek surprise looking round with a frightened glance as if not understanding why this 
was done to him a similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd 
lord exclaimed a sorrowful voice but after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from 
vereshchágin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain and that cry was fatal the barrier 
of human feeling strained to the utmost that had held the crowd in check suddenly 
broke the crime had begun and must now be completed the plaintive moan of reproach 
was drowned by the threatening and angry roar of the crowd like the seventh and 
last wave that shatters a ship that last irresistible wave burst from the rear and 
reached the front ranks carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all the dragoon 
was about to repeat his blow vereshchágin with a cry of horror covering his head 
with his hands rushed toward the crowd the tall youth against whom he stumbled seized 
his thin neck with his hands and yelling wildly fell with him under the feet 
of the pressing struggling crowd some beat and tore at vereshchágin others at the tall 
youth and the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who 
tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd it was 
a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth beaten almost to death 
and for a long time despite the feverish haste with which the mob tried to 
end the work that had been begun those who were hitting throttling and tearing at 
vereshchágin were unable to kill him for the crowd pressed from all sides swaying as 
one mass with them in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to 
kill him or let him go him with an ax eh crushed traitor he sold 
christ still alive tenacious serves him right torture serves a thief right use the hatchet 
alive only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a long 
drawn measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate bleeding corpse begin rapidly to 
change places each one came up glanced at what had been done and with horror 
reproach and astonishment pushed back again lord the people are like wild beasts how could 
he be alive voices in the crowd could be heard saying a young fellow too 
must have been a son what men and they say not the right one how 
not the right one o lord and another has been beaten say nearly done for 
oh the people they afraid of sinning said the same mob now looking with pained 
distress at the dead body with its long thin half severed neck and its livid 
face stained with blood and dust a painstaking police officer considering the presence of a 
corpse in his courtyard unseemly told the dragoons to take it away two dragoons took 
it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the ground the gory dust stained 
half shaven head with its long neck trailed twisting along the ground the crowd shrank 
back from it at the moment when vereshchágin fell and the crowd closed in with 
savage yells and swayed about him rostopchín suddenly turned pale and instead of going to 
the back entrance where his carriage awaited him went with hurried steps and bent head 
not knowing where and why along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground 
floor the face was white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his 
lower jaw way your excellency where are you going this way please said a trembling 
frightened voice behind him count rostopchín was unable to reply and turning obediently went in 
the direction indicated at the back entrance stood his calèche the distant roar of the 
yelling crowd was audible even there he hastily took his seat and told the coachman 
to drive him to his country house in sokólniki when they reached the myasnítski street 
and could no longer hear the shouts of the mob the count began to repent 
he remembered with dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his subordinates mob 
is he said to himself in french are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can 
appease one god is above us both words suddenly recurred to him and a disagreeable 
shiver ran down his back but this was only a momentary feeling and count rostopchín 
smiled disdainfully at himself had other duties thought he people had to be appeased many 
other victims have perished and are perishing for the public he began thinking of his 
social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to him and of himself 
as theodore vasílyevich rostopchín he fancied that theodore vasílyevich rostopchín was sacrificing himself for the 
public good but himself as governor the representative of authority and of the tsar i 
been simply theodore vasílyevich my course of action would have been quite different but it 
was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief lightly swaying 
on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer hearing the terrible sounds of 
the crowd rostopchín grew physically calm and as always happens as soon as he became 
physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too the thought 
which tranquillized rostopchín was not a new one since the world began and men have 
killed one another no one has ever committed such a crime against his fellow man 
without comforting himself with this same idea this idea is le bien public the hypothetical 
welfare of other people to a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never 
certain but he who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies 
and rostopchín now knew it not only did his reason not reproach him for what 
he had done but he even found cause for self satisfaction in having so successfully 
contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a criminal and at the 
same time pacify the mob was tried and condemned to death thought rostopchín though the 
senate had only condemned vereshchágin to hard labor was a traitor and a spy i 
could not let him go unpunished and so i have killed two birds with one 
stone to appease the mob i gave them a victim and at the same time 
punished a miscreant having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic 
arrangements the count grew quite tranquil half an hour later he was driving with his 
fast horses across the sokólniki field no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering 
what was to come he was driving to the yaúza bridge where he had heard 
that kutúzov was count rostopchín was mentally preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant 
to address to kutúzov for his deception he would make that foxy old courtier feel 
that the responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city 
and the ruin of russia as rostopchín regarded it would fall upon his doting old 
head planning beforehand what he would say to kutúzov rostopchín turned angrily in his calèche 
and gazed sternly from side to side the sokólniki field was deserted only at the 
end of it in front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum could be seen 
some people in white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and 
gesticulating one of these was running to cross the path of count carriage and the 
count himself his coachman and his dragoons looked with vague horror and curiosity at these 
released lunatics and especially at the one running toward them swaying from side to side 
on his long thin legs in his fluttering dressing gown this lunatic was running impetuously 
his gaze fixed on rostopchín shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to 
him to stop the solemn gloomy face was thin and yellow with its beard growing 
in uneven tufts his black agate pupils with saffron yellow whites moved restlessly near the 
lower eyelids pull up i tell you he cried in a piercing voice and again 
shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures coming abreast of the calèche he ran 
beside it have they slain me thrice have i risen from the dead they stoned 
me crucified me i shall rise shall rise shall rise they have torn my body 
the kingdom of god will be overthrown thrice will i overthrow it and thrice re 
establish it he cried raising his voice higher and higher count rostopchín suddenly grew pale 
as he had done when the crowd closed in on vereshchágin he turned away fas 
faster he cried in a trembling voice to his coachman the calèche flew over the 
ground as fast as the horses could draw it but for a long time count 
rostopchín still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the distance while his eyes 
saw nothing but the astonished frightened bloodstained face of in the fur lined coat recent 
as that mental picture was rostopchín already felt that it had cut deep into his 
heart and drawn blood even now he felt clearly that the gory trace of that 
recollection would not pass with time but that the terrible memory would on the contrary 
dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life 
he seemed still to hear the sound of his own words him down i command 
it did i utter those words it was by some accident i said them i 
need not have said them he thought then nothing would have happened he saw the 
frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon who dealt the blow the look of 
silent timid reproach that boy in the fur lined coat had turned upon him i 
did not do it for my own sake i was bound to act that way 
the mob the traitor the public welfare thought he troops were still crowding at the 
yaúza bridge it was hot kutúzov dejected and frowning sat on a bench by the 
bridge toying with his whip in the sand when a calèche dashed up noisily a 
man in a uniform with plumes in his hat went up to kutúzov and said 
something in french it was count rostopchín he told kutúzov that he had come because 
moscow the capital was no more and only the army remained would have been different 
if your serene highness had not told me that you would not abandon moscow without 
another battle all this would not have happened he said kutúzov looked at rostopchín as 
if not grasping what was said to him he was trying to read something peculiar 
written at that moment on the face of the man addressing him rostopchín grew confused 
and became silent kutúzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating gaze from 
face muttered softly i shall not give up moscow without a battle whether kutúzov was 
thinking of something entirely different when he spoke those words or uttered them purposely knowing 
them to be meaningless at any rate rostopchín made no reply and hastily left him 
and strange to say the governor of moscow the proud count rostopchín took up a 
cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts to drive on 
the carts that blocked the way chapter xxvi toward four in the afternoon troops were 
entering moscow in front rode a detachment of württemberg hussars and behind them rode the 
king of naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite about the middle of the arbát 
street near the church of the miraculous icon of st nicholas murat halted to await 
news from the advanced detachment as to the condition in which they had found the 
citadel le kremlin around murat gathered a group of those who had remained in moscow 
they all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange long haired commander dressed up in 
feathers and gold that their tsar himself not bad low voices could be heard saying 
an interpreter rode up to the group off your cap your caps these words went 
from one to another in the crowd the interpreter addressed an old porter and asked 
if it was far to the krémlin the porter listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar 
polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking russian did not understand what 
was being said to him and slipped behind the others murat approached the interpreter and 
told him to ask where the russian army was one of the russians understood what 
was asked and several voices at once began answering the interpreter a french officer returning 
from the advanced detachment rode up to murat and reported that the gates of the 
citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade there said murat and 
turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite ordered four light guns to be 
moved forward to fire at the gates the guns emerged at a trot from the 
column following murat and advanced up the arbát when they reached the end of the 
vozdvízhenka street they halted and drew in the square several french officers superintended the placing 
of the guns and looked at the krémlin through field glasses the bells in the 
krémlin were ringing for vespers and this sound troubled the french they imagined it to 
be a call to arms a few infantrymen ran to the kutáfyev gate beams and 
wooden screens had been put there and two musket shots rang out from under the 
gate as soon as an officer and men began to run toward it a general 
who was standing by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer and 
the latter ran back again with his men the sound of three more shots came 
from the gate one shot struck a french foot and from behind the screens came 
the strange sound of a few voices shouting instantly as at a word of command 
the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the french general officers and men 
changed to one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering to all of them 
from the marshal to the least soldier that place was not the vozdvízhenka mokhaváya or 
kutáfyev street nor the tróitsa gate places familiar in moscow but a new battlefield which 
would probably prove sanguinary and all made ready for that battle the cries from the 
gates ceased the guns were advanced the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks and 
an officer gave the word this was followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot 
one after another the shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the 
wooden beams and screens and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over the square a 
few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone built krémlin had 
died away the french heard a strange sound above their head thousands of crows rose 
above the walls and circled in the air cawing and noisily flapping their wings together 
with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke 
appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a coat he grasped a musket and 
took aim at the french repeated the officer once more and the reports of a 
musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously the gate was again hidden by 
smoke nothing more stirred behind the screens and the french infantry soldiers and officers advanced 
to the gate in the gateway lay three wounded and four dead two men in 
peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall toward the známenka that away 
said the officer pointing to the beams and the corpses and the french soldiers after 
dispatching the wounded threw the corpses over the parapet who these men were nobody knew 
that away was all that was said of them and they were thrown over the 
parapet and removed later on that they might not stink thiers alone dedicates a few 
eloquent lines to their memory wretches had occupied the sacred citadel having supplied themselves with 
guns from the arsenal and the wretches the french some of them were sabered and 
the krémlin was purged of their presence murat was informed that the way had been 
cleared the french entered the gates and began pitching their camp in the senate square 
out of the windows of the senate house the soldiers threw chairs into the square 
for fuel and kindled fires there other detachments passed through the krémlin and encamped along 
the moroséyka the lubyánka and pokróvka streets others quartered themselves along the vozdvízhenka the nikólski 
and the tverskóy streets no masters of the houses being found anywhere the french were 
not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as 
in a camp though tattered hungry worn out and reduced to a third of their 
original number the french entered moscow in good marching order it was a weary and 
famished but still a fighting and menacing army but it remained an army only until 
its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings as soon as the men of the 
various regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses the army was lost 
forever and there came into being something nondescript neither citizens nor soldiers but what are 
known as marauders when five weeks later these same men left moscow they no longer 
formed an army they were a mob of marauders each carrying a quantity of articles 
which seemed to him valuable or useful the aim of each man when he left 
moscow was no longer as it had been to conquer but merely to keep what 
he had acquired like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of 
a jug and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for 
fear of losing what it holds and therefore perishes the french when they left moscow 
had inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them yet to abandon what 
they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to 
open its paw and let go of its nuts ten minutes after each regiment had 
entered a moscow district not a soldier or officer was left men in military uniforms 
and hessian boots could be seen through the windows laughing and walking through the rooms 
in cellars and storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions and in the yards 
unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors lighting fires in kitchens and kneading 
and baking bread with rolled up sleeves and cooking or frightening amusing or caressing women 
and children there were many such men both in the shops and there was no 
army order after order was issued by the french commanders that day forbidding the men 
to disperse about the town sternly forbidding any violence to the inhabitants or any looting 
and announcing a roll call for that very evening but despite all these measures the 
men who had till then constituted an army flowed all over the wealthy deserted city 
with its comforts and plentiful supplies as a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together 
when crossing a barren field but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably 
as soon as it reaches rich pastures so did the army disperse all over the 
wealthy city no residents were left in moscow and the water percolating through irresistibly through 
the city in all directions from the krémlin into which they had first marched the 
cavalry on entering a house that had been abandoned and finding there stabling more than 
sufficient for their horses went on all the same to the next house which seemed 
to them better many of them appropriated several houses chalked their names on them and 
quarreled and even fought with other companies for them before they had had time to 
secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and hearing 
that everything had been abandoned rushed to places where valuables were to be had for 
the taking the officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing 
the same in carriage row carriages had been left in the shops and generals flocked 
there to select calèches and coaches for themselves the few inhabitants who had remained invited 
commanding officers to their houses hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered there were 
masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it all around the quarters occupied 
by the french were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where they thought yet greater 
riches might be found and moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper when water 
is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud 
results and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich 
and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army 
and the wealthy city the french attributed the fire of moscow au patriotisme féroce de 
rostopchíne the russians to the barbarity of the french in reality however it was not 
and could not be possible to explain the burning of moscow by making any individual 
or any group of people responsible for it moscow was burned because it found itself 
in a position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn quite 
apart from whether it had or had not a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines 
deserted moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn 
on which sparks continually fall for several days a town built of wood where scarcely 
a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police 
force is present cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is 
occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes make campfires of the senate chairs in the senate 
square and cook themselves meals twice a day in peacetime it is only necessary to 
billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in that 
district immediately increases how much then must the probability of fire be increased in an 
abandoned wooden town where foreign troops are quartered patriotisme féroce de and the barbarity of 
the french were not to blame in the matter moscow was set on fire by 
the pipes kitchens and campfires and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they 
did not own even if there was any arson which is very doubtful for no 
one had any reason to burn the any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to 
do arson cannot be regarded as the cause for the same thing would have happened 
without any incendiarism to ferocious patriotism however tempting it might be for the french to 
blame ferocity and for russians to blame the scoundrel bonaparte or later on to place 
an heroic torch in the hands of their own people it is impossible not to 
see that there could be no such direct cause of the fire for moscow had 
to burn as every village factory or house must burn which is left by its 
owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge moscow was 
burned by its inhabitants it is true but by those who had abandoned it and 
not by those who remained in it moscow when occupied by the enemy did not 
remain intact like berlin vienna and other towns simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and 
did not welcome the french with bread and salt nor bring them the keys of 
the city chapter xxvii the absorption of the french by moscow radiating starwise as it 
did only reached the quarter where pierre was staying by the evening of the second 
of september after the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances pierre was 
in a state bordering on insanity he was completely obsessed by one persistent thought he 
did not know how or when this thought had taken such possession of him but 
he remembered nothing of the past understood nothing of the present and all he saw 
and heard appeared to him like a dream he had left home only to escape 
the intricate tangle of demands that enmeshed him and which in his present condition he 
was unable to unravel he had gone to joseph house on the plea of sorting 
the books and papers only in search of rest from turmoil for in his mind 
the memory of joseph alexéevich was connected with a world of eternal solemn and calm 
thoughts quite contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being drawn he 
sought a quiet refuge and in joseph study he really found it when he sat 
with his elbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study 
calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after another in his 
imagination particularly of the battle of borodinó and of that vague sense of his own 
insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth simplicity and strength of the class of men 
he mentally classed as they when gerásim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred 
to him of taking part in the popular defense of moscow which he knew was 
projected and with that object he had asked gerásim to get him a coat and 
a pistol confiding to him his intentions of remaining in joseph house and keeping his 
name secret then during the first day spent in inaction and solitude he tried several 
times to fix his attention on the masonic manuscripts but was unable to do so 
the idea that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name 
in connection with more than once vaguely presented itself but the idea that he besuhof 
was destined to set a limit to the power of the beast was as yet 
only one of the fancies that often passed through his mind and left no trace 
behind when having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among the 
people in the defense of moscow pierre had met the rostóvs and natásha had said 
to him you remaining in moscow how splendid the thought flashed into his mind that 
it really would be a good thing even if moscow were taken for him to 
remain there and do what he was predestined to do next day with the sole 
idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in any way behind them pierre went 
to the three hills gate but when he returned to the house convinced that moscow 
would not be defended he suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely 
a possibility had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable he must remain in moscow concealing 
his name and must meet napoleon and kill him and either perish or put an 
end to the misery of all it seemed to him was solely due to napoleon 
pierre knew all the details of the attempt on life in 1809 by a german 
student in vienna and knew that the student had been shot and the risk to 
which he would expose his life by carrying out his design excited him still more 
two equally strong feelings drew pierre irresistibly to this purpose the first was a feeling 
of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in view of the common calamity the same 
feeling that had caused him to go to mozháysk on the twenty fifth and to 
make his way to the very thick of the battle and had now caused him 
to run away from his home and in place of the luxury and comfort to 
which he was accustomed to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the 
same food as gerásim the other was that vague and quite russian feeling of contempt 
for everything conventional artificial and everything the majority of men regard as the greatest good 
in the world pierre had first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the slobóda 
palace when he had suddenly felt that wealth power and that men so painstakingly acquire 
and it has any worth has so only by reason of the joy with which 
it can all be renounced it was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to 
spend his last penny on drink and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses 
for no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he 
possesses the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from an ordinary point 
of view are insane to test as it were his personal power and strength affirming 
the existence of a higher nonhuman criterion of life from the very day pierre had 
experienced this feeling for the first time at the slobóda palace he had been continuously 
under its influence but only now found full satisfaction for it moreover at this moment 
pierre was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he had 
already done in that direction if he were now to leave moscow like everyone else 
his flight from home the peasant coat the pistol and his announcement to the rostóvs 
that he would remain in moscow would all become not merely meaningless but contemptible and 
ridiculous and to this pierre was very sensitive physical condition as is always the case 
corresponded to his mental state the unaccustomed coarse food the vodka he drank during those 
days the absence of wine and cigars his dirty unchanged linen two almost sleepless nights 
passed on a short sofa without this kept him in a state of excitement bordering 
on insanity it was two in the afternoon the french had already entered moscow pierre 
knew this but instead of acting he only thought about his undertaking going over its 
minutest details in his mind in his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself 
either the striking of the blow or the death of napoleon but with extraordinary vividness 
and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance alone for the sake of 
all i must do it or perish he thought i will approach and then suddenly 
with pistol or dagger but that is all the same is not i but the 
hand of providence that punishes thee i shall say thought he imagining what he would 
say when killing napoleon then take me and execute me he went on speaking to 
himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression while pierre standing in 
the middle of the room was talking to himself in this way the study door 
opened and on the threshold appeared the figure of makár alexéevich always so timid before 
but now quite transformed his dressing gown was unfastened his face red and distorted he 
was obviously drunk on seeing pierre he grew confused at first but noticing embarrassment on 
face immediately grew bold and staggering on his thin legs advanced into the middle of 
the room frightened he said confidentially in a hoarse voice say i surrender i say 
am i not right sir he paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the 
table seized it with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor gerásim and the 
porter who had followed makár alexéevich stopped him in the vestibule and tried to take 
the pistol from him pierre coming out into the corridor looked with pity and repulsion 
at the half crazy old man makár alexéevich frowning with exertion held on to the 
pistol and screamed hoarsely evidently with some heroic fancy in his head arms board them 
no you get it he yelled will do please that will do have the sir 
to let go please sir pleaded gerásim trying carefully to steer makár alexéevich by the 
elbows back to the door are you bonaparte shouted makár alexéevich not right sir come 
to your room please and rest allow me to have the pistol off thou base 
slave touch me not see this shouted makár alexéevich brandishing the pistol them hold whispered 
gerásim to the porter they seized makár alexéevich by the arms and dragged him to 
the door the vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of 
a tipsy hoarse voice suddenly a fresh sound a piercing feminine scream reverberated from the 
porch and the cook came running into the vestibule them gracious heavens o lord four 
of them horsemen she cried gerásim and the porter let makár alexéevich go and in 
the now silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could 
be heard chapter xxviii pierre having decided that until he had carried out his design 
he would disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of french stood at the half 
open door of the corridor intending to conceal himself as soon as the french entered 
but the french entered and still pierre did not irresistible curiosity kept him there there 
were two of them one was an tall soldierly handsome other evidently a private or 
an orderly sunburned short and thin with sunken cheeks and a dull expression the officer 
walked in front leaning on a stick and slightly limping when he had advanced a 
few steps he stopped having apparently decided that these were good quarters turned round to 
the soldiers standing at the entrance and in a loud voice of command ordered them 
to put up the horses having done that the officer lifting his elbow with a 
smart gesture stroked his mustache and lightly touched his hat la compagnie said he gaily 
smiling and looking about him day everybody no one gave any reply êtes le bourgeois 
the officer asked gerásim you the master here gerásim gazed at the officer with an 
alarmed and inquiring look quartier logement said the officer looking down at the little man 
with a condescending and good natured smile français sont de bons enfants que diable voyons 
ne nous fâchons pas mon vieux added he clapping the scared and silent gerásim on 
the shoulder does no one speak french in this establishment he asked again in french 
looking around and meeting eyes pierre moved away from the door quarters lodgings the french 
are good fellows what the devil there let us be cross old fellow again the 
officer turned to gerásim and asked him to show him the rooms in the house 
not understand me you said gerásim trying to render his words more comprehensible by contorting 
them still smiling the french officer spread out his hands before nose intimating that he 
did not understand him either and moved limping to the door at which pierre was 
standing pierre wished to go away and conceal himself but at that moment he saw 
makár alexéevich appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand with 
a cunning makár alexéevich eyed the frenchman raised his pistol and took aim them yelled 
the tipsy man trying to press the trigger hearing the yell the officer turned round 
and at the same moment pierre threw himself on the drunkard just when pierre snatched 
at and struck up the pistol makár alexéevich at last got his fingers on the 
trigger there was a deafening report and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke 
the frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door forgetting his intention of concealing his 
knowledge of french pierre snatching away the pistol and throwing it down ran up to 
the officer and addressed him in french are not wounded he asked think not answered 
the frenchman feeling himself over i have had a lucky escape this time he added 
pointing to the damaged plaster of the wall is that man said he looking sternly 
at pierre i am really in despair at what has occurred said pierre rapidly quite 
forgetting the part he had intended to play is an unfortunate madman who did not 
know what he was doing the officer went up to makár alexéevich and took him 
by the collar makár alexéevich was standing with parted lips swaying as if about to 
fall asleep as he leaned against the wall you shall pay for this said the 
frenchman letting go of him french are merciful after victory but we do not pardon 
traitors he added with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic gesture pierre 
continued in french to persuade the officer not to hold that drunken imbecile to account 
the frenchman listened in silence with the same gloomy expression but suddenly turned to pierre 
with a smile for a few seconds he looked at him in silence his handsome 
face assumed a melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand have saved my 
life you are french said he for a frenchman that deduction was indubitable only a 
frenchman could perform a great deed and to save his life of m ramballe captain 
of the 13th light undoubtedly a very great deed but however indubitable that conclusion and 
the conviction based upon it pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him am russian he 
said quickly tut tut tell that to others said the officer waving his finger before 
his nose and smiling shall tell me all about that presently i am delighted to 
meet a compatriot well and what are we to do with this man he added 
addressing himself to pierre as to a brother even if pierre were not a frenchman 
having once received that loftiest of human appellations he could not renounce it said the 
look and tone in reply to his last question pierre again explained who makár alexéevich 
was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol 
which they had not had time to recover from him and begged the officer to 
let the deed go unpunished the frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture 
with his arm have saved my life you are french you ask his pardon i 
grant it you lead that man away said he quickly and energetically and taking the 
arm of pierre whom he had promoted to be a frenchman for saving his life 
he went with him into the room the soldiers in the yard hearing the shot 
came into the passage asking what had happened and expressed their readiness to punish the 
culprits but the officer sternly checked them will be called in when you are wanted 
he said the soldiers went out again and the orderly who had meanwhile had time 
to visit the kitchen came up to his officer there is soup and a leg 
of mutton in the kitchen said he i serve them up and some wine answered 
the captain chapter xxix when the french officer went into the room with pierre the 
latter again thought it his duty to assure him that he was not french and 
wished to go away but the officer would not hear of it he was so 
very polite amiable good natured and genuinely grateful to pierre for saving his life that 
pierre had not the heart to refuse and sat down with him in the first 
room they entered to assurances that he was not a frenchman the captain evidently not 
understanding how anyone could decline so flattering an appellation shrugged his shoulders and said that 
if pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a russian let it be so but for 
all that he would be forever bound to pierre by gratitude for saving his life 
had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the feelings of others 
and had he at all understood what feelings were the latter would probably have left 
him but the animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed pierre frenchman or a 
russian prince incognito said the officer looking at fine though dirty linen and at the 
ring on his finger owe my life to you and offer you my friendship a 
frenchman never forgets either an insult or a service i offer you my friendship that 
is all i can say there was so much good nature and nobility in the 
french sense of the word in the voice in the expression of his face and 
in his gestures that pierre unconsciously smiling in response to the smile pressed the hand 
held out to him ramballe of the 13th light regiment chevalier of the legion of 
honor for the affair on the seventh of september he introduced himself a self satisfied 
irrepressible smile puckering his lips under his mustache you now be so good as to 
tell me with whom i have the honor of conversing so pleasantly instead of being 
in the ambulance with that bullet in my body pierre replied that he could not 
tell him his name and blushing began to try to invent a name and to 
say something about his reason for concealing it but the frenchman hastily interrupted him please 
said he understand your reasons you are an officer a superior officer perhaps you have 
borne arms against us not my business i owe you my life that is enough 
for me i am quite at your service you belong to the gentry he concluded 
with a shade of inquiry in his tone pierre bent his head baptismal name if 
you please that is all i ask monsieur pierre you say all i want to 
know when the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka 
brought with some wine which the french had taken from a russian cellar and brought 
with them ramballe invited pierre to share his dinner and himself began to eat greedily 
and quickly like a healthy and hungry man munching his food rapidly with his strong 
teeth continually smacking his lips and delicious his face grew red and was covered with 
perspiration pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure morel the orderly brought some 
hot water in a saucepan and placed a bottle of claret in it he also 
brought a bottle of kvass taken from the kitchen for them to try that beverage 
was already known to the french and had been given a special name they called 
it limonade de cochon lemonade and morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he 
had found in the kitchen but as the captain had the wine they had taken 
while passing through moscow he left the kvass to morel and applied himself to the 
bottle of bordeaux he wrapped the bottle up to its neck in a table napkin 
and poured out wine for himself and for pierre the satisfaction of his hunger and 
the wine rendered the captain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner 
my dear monsieur pierre i owe you a fine votive candle for saving me from 
that maniac you see i have bullets enough in my body already here is one 
i got at he touched his side a second at showed a scar on his 
this leg which as you see does not want to march i got that on 
the seventh at the great battle of la moskowa sacré dieu it was splendid that 
deluge of fire was worth seeing it was a tough job you set us there 
my word you may be proud of it and on my honor in spite of 
the cough i caught there i should be ready to begin again i pity those 
who did not see it was there said pierre really so much the better you 
are certainly brave foes the great redoubt held out well by my pipe continued the 
frenchman you made us pay dear for it i was at it three as i 
sit here three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back 
like cardboard figures oh it was beautiful monsieur pierre your grenadiers were splendid by heaven 
i saw them close up their ranks six times in succession and march as if 
on parade fine fellows our king of naples who knows what cried ha ha so 
you are one of us soldiers he added smiling after a momentary pause much the 
better so much the better monsieur pierre terrible in battle gallant with the he winked 
and smiled what the french are monsieur pierre they the captain was so naïvely and 
good humoredly gay so real and so pleased with himself that pierre almost winked back 
as he looked merrily at him probably the word turned the thoughts to the state 
of moscow tell me please is it true that the women have all left moscow 
what a queer idea what had they to be afraid of not the french ladies 
leave paris if the russians entered it asked pierre ha ha the frenchman emitted a 
merry sanguine chuckle patting pierre on the shoulder a thing to say he exclaimed but 
paris paris capital of the world pierre finished his remark for him the captain looked 
at pierre he had a habit of stopping short in the middle of his talk 
and gazing intently with his laughing kindly eyes if you told me you were russian 
i should have wagered that you were parisian you have that i know what that 
and having uttered this compliment he again gazed at him in silence have been in 
paris i spent years there said pierre yes one sees that plainly paris a man 
who know paris is a savage you can tell a parisian two leagues off paris 
is talma la duchénois potier the sorbonne the boulevards and noticing that his conclusion was 
weaker than what had gone before he added quickly is only one paris in the 
world you have been to paris and have remained russian well i esteem you the 
less for it under the influence of the wine he had drunk and after the 
days he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts pierre involuntarily enjoyed talking with this 
cheerful and good natured man return to your hear they are lovely what a wretched 
idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the french army is in 
moscow what a chance those girls have missed your peasants another thing but you civilized 
people you ought to know us better than that we took vienna berlin madrid naples 
rome warsaw all the capitals we are feared but we are loved we are nice 
to know and then the emperor he began but pierre interrupted him emperor pierre repeated 
and his face suddenly became sad and embarrassed the emperor emperor he is generosity mercy 
justice order what the emperor is it is i ramballe who tell you so i 
assure you i was his enemy eight years ago my father was an emigrant count 
but that man has vanquished me he has taken hold of me i could not 
resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered france when 
i understood what he i saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels for 
us you know i said to myself is a monarch and i devoted myself to 
him so there oh yes mon cher he is the greatest man of the ages 
past or future he in moscow pierre stammered with a guilty look the frenchman looked 
at his guilty face and smiled he will make his entry tomorrow he replied and 
continued his talk their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the 
gate and by morel who came to say that some württemberg hussars had come and 
wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the horses were this difficulty 
had arisen chiefly because the hussars did not understand what was said to them in 
french the captain had their senior sergeant called in and in a stern voice asked 
him to what regiment he belonged who was his commanding officer and by what right 
he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already occupied the german who knew little 
french answered the two first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of 
his commanding officer but in reply to the third question which he did not understand 
said introducing broken french into his own german that he was the quartermaster of the 
regiment and his commander had ordered him to occupy all the houses one after another 
pierre who knew german translated what the german said to the captain and gave the 
reply to the württemberg hussar in german when he had understood what was said to 
him the german submitted and took his men elsewhere the captain went out into the 
porch and gave some orders in a loud voice when he returned to the room 
pierre was sitting in the same place as before with his head in his hands 
his face expressed suffering he really was suffering at that moment when the captain went 
out and he was left alone suddenly he came to himself and realized the position 
he was in it was not that moscow had been taken or that the happy 
conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him painful as that was it was 
not that which tormented pierre at the moment he was tormented by the consciousness of 
his own weakness the few glasses of wine he had drunk and the conversation with 
this good natured man had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had 
spent the last few days and which was essential for the execution of his design 
the pistol dagger and peasant coat were ready napoleon was to enter the town next 
day pierre still considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay 
the evildoer but now he felt that he would not do it he did not 
know why but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his intention 
he struggled against the confession of his weakness but dimly felt that he could not 
overcome it and that his former gloomy frame of mind concerning vengeance killing and self 
sacrifice had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met the 
captain returned to the room limping slightly and whistling a tune the chatter which had 
previously amused pierre now repelled him the tune he was whistling his gait and the 
gesture with which he twirled his mustache all now seemed offensive will go away immediately 
i say another word to him thought pierre he thought this but still sat in 
the same place a strange feeling of weakness tied him to the spot he wished 
to get up and go away but could not do so the captain on the 
other hand seemed very cheerful he paced up and down the room twice his eyes 
shone and his mustache twitched as if he were smiling to himself at some amusing 
thought colonel of those württembergers is delightful he suddenly said a german but a nice 
fellow all the same but a german he sat down facing pierre the way you 
know german then pierre looked at him in silence is the german for pierre repeated 
german for shelter is unterkunft do you say it the captain asked quickly and doubtfully 
pierre repeated said the captain and looked at pierre for some seconds with laughing eyes 
germans are first rate fools you think so monsieur pierre he concluded have another bottle 
of this moscow bordeaux shall we morel will warm us up another little bottle morel 
he called out gaily morel brought candles and a bottle of wine the captain looked 
at pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression on his 
face ramballe with genuine distress and sympathy in his face went up to pierre and 
bent over him now sad said he touching hand i upset you no really have 
you anything against me he asked pierre the state of affairs pierre did not answer 
but looked cordially into the eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him without 
speaking of what i owe you i feel friendship for you can i do anything 
for you dispose of me it is for life and death i say it with 
my hand on my heart said he striking his chest you said pierre the captain 
gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that was unterkunft in 
german and his face suddenly brightened in that case i drink to our friendship he 
cried gaily filling two glasses with wine pierre took one of the glasses and emptied 
it ramballe emptied his too again pressed hand and leaned his elbows on the table 
in a pensive attitude my dear friend he began is caprice who would have said 
that i should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the service of 
bonaparte as we used to call him yet here i am in moscow with him 
i must tell you mon cher he continued in the sad and measured tones of 
a man who intends to tell a long story our name is one of the 
most ancient in france and with a easy and naïve frankness the captain told pierre 
the story of his ancestors his childhood youth and manhood and all about his relations 
and his financial and family affairs pauvre playing of course an important part in the 
story all that is only setting the real thing is am i not right monsieur 
pierre said he growing animated glass pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out 
a third women women and the captain looking with glistening eyes at pierre began talking 
of love and of his love affairs there were very many of these as one 
could easily believe looking at the handsome self satisfied face and noting the eager enthusiasm 
with which he spoke of women though all love stories had the sensual character which 
frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry of love yet he told his story 
with such sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of 
love and he described women so alluringly that pierre listened to him with curiosity it 
was plain that which the frenchman was so fond of was not that low and 
simple kind that pierre had once felt for his wife nor was it the romantic 
love stimulated by himself that he experienced for natásha ramballe despised both these kinds of 
love equally the one he considered the of and the other the of simpletons which 
the frenchman worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and 
in a combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling thus the captain 
touchingly recounted the story of his love for a fascinating marquise of thirty five and 
at the same time for a charming innocent child of seventeen daughter of the bewitching 
marquise the conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter ending in the sacrificing 
herself and offering her daughter in marriage to her lover even now agitated the captain 
though it was the memory of a distant past then he recounted an episode in 
which the husband played the part of the lover and the role of the husband 
as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of germany where is called unterkunft 
and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the young girls are blonde finally the latest 
episode in poland still fresh in the memory and which he narrated with rapid gestures 
and glowing face was of how he had saved the life of a pole in 
general the saving of life continually occurred in the stories and the pole had entrusted 
to him his enchanting wife parisienne de cœur while himself entering the french service the 
captain was happy the enchanting polish lady wished to elope with him but prompted by 
magnanimity the captain restored the wife to the husband saying as he did so have 
saved your life and i save your honor having repeated these words the captain wiped 
his eyes and gave himself a shake as if driving away the weakness which assailed 
him at this touching recollection listening to the tales often happens late in the evening 
and under the influence of all that was told him understood it all and at 
the same time followed a train of personal memories which he knew not why suddenly 
arose in his mind while listening to these love stories his own love for natásha 
unexpectedly rose to his mind and going over the pictures of that love in his 
imagination he mentally compared them with tales listening to the story of the struggle between 
love and duty pierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting 
with the object of his love at the súkharev water tower at the time of 
that meeting it had not produced an effect upon had not even once recalled it 
but now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very 
important and poetic kirílovich come here we have recognized you he now seemed to hear 
the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes her smile her 
traveling hood and a stray lock of her hair and there seemed to him something 
pathetic and touching in all this having finished his tale about the enchanting polish lady 
the captain asked pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice himself 
for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband challenged by this question 
pierre raised his head and felt a need to express the thoughts that filled his 
mind he began to explain that he understood love for a woman somewhat differently he 
said that in all his life he had loved and still loved only one woman 
and that she could never be his said the captain pierre then explained that he 
had loved this woman from his earliest years but that he had not dared to 
think of her because she was too young and because he had been an illegitimate 
son without a name afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared 
not think of her because he loved her too well placing her far above everything 
in the world and especially therefore above himself when he had reached this point pierre 
asked the captain whether he understood that the captain made a gesture signifying that even 
if he did not understand it he begged pierre to continue love clouds he muttered 
whether it was the wine he had drunk or an impulse of frankness or the 
thought that this man did not and never would know any of those who played 
a part in his story or whether it was all these things together something loosened 
tongue speaking thickly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes he told the 
whole story of his life his marriage love for his best friend her betrayal of 
him and all his own simple relations with her urged on by questions he also 
told what he had at first own position and even his name more than anything 
else in story the captain was impressed by the fact that pierre was very rich 
had two mansions in moscow and that he had abandoned everything and not left the 
city but remained there concealing his name and station when it was late at night 
they went out together into the street the night was warm and light to the 
left of the house on the pokróvka a fire first of those that were beginning 
in moscow to the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of 
the waning moon and opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in 
heart with his love at the gate stood gerásim the cook and two frenchmen their 
laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in two languages could be heard they were looking 
at the glow seen in the town there was nothing terrible in the one small 
distant fire in the immense city gazing at the high starry sky at the moon 
at the comet and at the glow from the fire pierre experienced a joyful emotion 
now how good it is what more does one need thought he and suddenly remembering 
his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned against the fence 
to save himself from falling without taking leave of his new friend pierre left the 
gate with unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and 
immediately fell asleep chapter xxx the glow of the first fire that began on the 
second of september was watched from the various roads by the fugitive muscovites and by 
the retreating troops with many different feelings the rostóv party spent the night at mytíshchi 
fourteen miles from moscow they had started so late on the first of september the 
road had been so blocked by vehicles and troops so many things had been forgotten 
for which servants were sent back that they had decided to spend that night at 
a place three miles out of moscow the next morning they woke late and were 
again delayed so often that they only got as far as great mytíshchi at ten 
that evening the rostóv family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in 
the yards and huts of that large village the servants and coachmen and the orderlies 
of the wounded officers after attending to their masters had supper fed the horses and 
came out into the porches in a neighboring hut lay adjutant with a fractured wrist 
the awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously and his moaning sounded 
terrible in the darkness of the autumn night he had spent the first night in 
the same yard as the rostóvs the countess said she had been unable to close 
her eyes on account of his moaning and at mytíshchi she moved into a worse 
hut simply to be farther away from the wounded man in the darkness of the 
night one of the servants noticed above the high body of a coach standing before 
the porch the small glow of another fire one glow had long been visible and 
everybody knew that it was little mytíshchi on fire by cossacks look here brothers another 
fire remarked an orderly all turned their attention to the glow they told us little 
mytíshchi had been set on fire by cossacks not mytíshchi farther away it must be 
in moscow two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach 
and sat down on its steps more to the left why little mytíshchi is over 
there and this is right on the other side several men joined the first two 
how flaring said one a fire in moscow either in the sushchévski or the rogózhski 
quarter no one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently 
at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance old daniel teréntich the 
valet as he was called came up to the group and shouted at míshka are 
you staring at you good for nothing the count will be calling and nobody there 
go and gather the clothes together only ran out to get some water said míshka 
what do you think daniel teréntich it look as if that glow were in moscow 
remarked one of the footmen daniel teréntich made no reply and again for a long 
time they were all silent the glow spread rising and falling farther and farther still 
have mercy windy and dry said another voice look see what doing now o lord 
you can even see the crows flying lord have mercy on us sinners put it 
out no fear to put it out daniel teréntich who had hitherto been silent was 
heard to say his voice was calm and deliberate it is brothers said he moscow 
the white his voice faltered and he gave way to an old sob and it 
was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the significance for 
them of the glow they were watching sighs were heard words of prayer and the 
sobbing of the old valet chapter xxxi the valet returning to the cottage informed the 
count that moscow was burning the count donned his dressing gown and went out to 
look sónya and madame schoss who had not yet undressed went out with him only 
natásha and the countess remained in the room pétya was no longer with the family 
he had gone on with his regiment which was making for tróitsa the countess on 
hearing that moscow was on fire began to cry natásha pale with a fixed look 
was sitting on the bench under the icons just where she had sat down on 
arriving and paid no attention to her words she was listening to the ceaseless moaning 
of the adjutant three houses off how terrible said sónya returning from the yard chilled 
and frightened believe the whole of moscow will burn an awful glow natásha do look 
you can see it from the window she said to her cousin evidently wishing to 
distract her mind but natásha looked at her as if not understanding what was said 
to her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove she had 
been in this condition of stupor since the morning when sónya to the surprise and 
annoyance of the countess had for some unaccountable reason found it necessary to tell natásha 
of prince wound and of his being with their party the countess had seldom been 
so angry with anyone as she was with sónya sónya had cried and begged to 
be forgiven and now as if trying to atone for her fault paid unceasing attention 
to her cousin natásha how dreadfully it is burning said she burning asked natásha yes 
moscow and as if in order not to offend sónya and to get rid of 
her she turned her face to the window looked out in such a way that 
it was evident that she could not see anything and again settled down in her 
former attitude you see it really i did natásha replied in a voice that pleaded 
to be left in peace both the countess and sónya understood that naturally neither moscow 
nor the burning of moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to natásha the 
count returned and lay down behind the partition the countess went up to her daughter 
and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was wont to 
do when natásha was ill then touched her forehead with her lips as if to 
feel whether she was feverish and finally kissed her are cold you are trembling all 
over better lie down said the countess down all right i will lie down at 
once said natásha when natásha had been told that morning that prince andrew was seriously 
wounded and was traveling with their party she had at first asked many questions where 
was he going how was he wounded was it serious and could she see him 
but after she had been told that she could not see him that he was 
seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger she ceased to ask questions 
or to speak at all evidently disbelieving what they told her and convinced that say 
what she might she would still be told the same all the way she had 
sat motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes and the expression 
in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much and now she 
sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving 
she was planning something and either deciding or had already decided something in her mind 
the countess knew this but what it might be she did not know and this 
alarmed and tormented her undress darling lie down on my bed a bed had been 
made on a bedstead for the countess only madame schoss and the two girls were 
to sleep on some hay on the floor mamma i will lie down here on 
the floor natásha replied irritably and she went to the window and opened it through 
the open window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly she put 
her head out into the damp night air and the countess saw her slim neck 
shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame natásha knew it was not prince 
andrew who was moaning she knew prince andrew was in the same yard as themselves 
and in a part of the hut across the passage but this dreadful incessant moaning 
made her sob the countess exchanged a look with sónya down darling lie down my 
pet said the countess softly touching shoulders lie down yes lie down at once said 
natásha and began hurriedly undressing tugging at the tapes of her petticoat when she had 
thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket she sat down with her 
foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the floor jerked 
her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front and began replaiting it 
her long thin practiced fingers rapidly unplaited replaited and tied up her plait her head 
moved from side to side from habit but her eyes feverishly wide looked fixedly before 
her when her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet 
spread over the hay on the side nearest the door better lie in the middle 
said sónya stay here muttered natásha lie down she added crossly and buried her face 
in the pillow the countess madame schoss and sónya undressed hastily and lay down the 
small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room 
but in the yard there was a light from the fire at little mytíshchi a 
mile and a half away and through the night came the noise of people shouting 
at a tavern cossacks had set up across the street and the unceasing moans could 
still be heard for a long time natásha listened attentively to the sounds that reached 
her from inside and outside the room and did not move first she heard her 
mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her then madame familiar 
whistling snore and gentle breathing then the countess called to natásha natásha did not answer 
think asleep mamma said sónya softly after a short silence the countess spoke again but 
this time no one replied soon after that natásha heard her even breathing natásha did 
not move though her little bare foot thrust out from under the quilt was growing 
cold on the bare floor as if to celebrate a victory over everybody a cricket 
chirped in a crack in the wall a cock crowed far off and another replied 
near by the shouting in the tavern had died down only the moaning of the 
adjutant was heard natásha sat up are you asleep mamma she whispered no one replied 
natásha rose slowly and carefully crossed herself and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty 
floor with her slim supple bare feet the boards of the floor creaked stepping cautiously 
from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to 
the door and grasped the cold door handle it seemed to her that something heavy 
was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room it was her own heart 
sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love she opened the door and stepped 
across the threshold and onto the cold damp earthen floor of the passage the cold 
she felt refreshed her with her bare feet she touched a sleeping man stepped over 
him and opened the door into the part of the hut where prince andrew lay 
it was dark in there in the farthest corner on a bench beside a bed 
on which something was lying stood a tallow candle with a long thick and smoldering 
wick from the moment she had been told that morning of prince wound and his 
presence there natásha had resolved to see him she did not know why she had 
to she knew the meeting would be painful but felt the more convinced that it 
was necessary all day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night 
but now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she 
might see how was he maimed what was left of him was he like that 
incessant moaning of the yes he was altogether like that in her imagination he was 
that terrible moaning personified when she saw an indistinct shape in the corner and mistook 
his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders she imagined a horrible body there 
and stood still in terror but an irresistible impulse drew her forward she cautiously took 
one step and then another and found herself in the middle of a small room 
containing baggage another lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons and two 
doctor and a on the floor the valet sat up and whispered something timókhin kept 
awake by the pain in his wounded leg gazed with wide open eyes at this 
strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise dressing jacket and nightcap the sleepy 
frightened exclamation do you want the matter made natásha approach more swiftly to what was 
lying in the corner horribly unlike a man as that body looked she must see 
him she passed the valet the snuff fell from the candle wick and she saw 
prince andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt and such as she had always 
seen him he was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face 
his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her and especially his neck delicate as a revealed 
by the turn down collar of his shirt gave him a peculiarly innocent childlike look 
such as she had never seen on him before she went up to him and 
with a swift flexible youthful movement dropped on her knees he smiled and held out 
his hand to her chapter xxxii seven days had passed since prince andrew found himself 
in the ambulance station on the field of borodinó his feverish state and the inflammation 
of his bowels which were injured were in the opinion sure to carry him off 
but on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some 
tea and the doctor noticed that his temperature was lower he had regained consciousness that 
morning the first night after they left moscow had been fairly warm and he had 
remained in the calèche but at mytíshchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken 
out and given some tea the pain caused by his removal into the hut had 
made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness when he had been placed on his 
camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes then he opened 
them and whispered softly the tea his remembering such a small detail of everyday life 
astonished the doctor he felt prince pulse and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it 
had improved he was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did 
not die now he would do so a little later with greater suffering timókhin the 
red nosed major of prince regiment had joined him in moscow and was being taken 
along with him having been wounded in the leg at the battle of borodinó they 
were accompanied by a doctor prince valet his coachman and two orderlies they gave prince 
andrew some tea he drank it eagerly looking with feverish eyes at the door in 
front of him as if trying to understand and remember something want any more is 
timókhin here he asked timókhin crept along the bench to him am here your excellency 
your wound sir all right but how about you prince andrew again pondered as if 
trying to remember something one get a book he asked book gospels i one the 
doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was feeling 
prince andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but reasonably and then said he wanted a 
bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and 
valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and making wry faces at the 
noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound began examining that dreadful place 
the doctor was very much displeased about something and made a change in the dressings 
turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious 
from the agony he kept asking them to get him the book and put it 
under him trouble would it be to you he said have not got one please 
get it for me and put it under for a moment he pleaded in a 
piteous voice the doctor went into the passage to wash his hands fellows have no 
conscience said he to the valet who was pouring water over his hands just one 
moment i look after you such pain you know that i wonder how he can 
bear it the lord jesus christ i thought we had put something under him said 
the valet the first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was the 
matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked to be 
carried into the hut after his calèche had stopped at mytíshchi after growing confused from 
pain while being carried into the hut he again regained consciousness and while drinking tea 
once more recalled all that had happened to him and above all vividly remembered the 
moment at the ambulance station when at the sight of the sufferings of a man 
he disliked those new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness and those 
thoughts though now vague and indefinite again possessed his soul he remembered that he had 
now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to do with 
the gospels that was why he asked for a copy of them the uncomfortable position 
in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts and 
when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of 
the night everybody near him was sleeping a cricket chirped from across the passage someone 
was shouting and singing in the street cockroaches rustled on the table on the icons 
and on the walls and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed 
and around the candle beside him the wick of which was charred and had shaped 
itself like a mushroom his mind was not in a normal state a healthy man 
usually thinks of feels and remembers innumerable things simultaneously but has the power and will 
to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention 
a healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil 
word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts 
but prince mind was not in a normal state in that respect all the powers 
of his mind were more active and clearer than ever but they acted apart from 
his will most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously at times his brain suddenly 
began to work with a vigor clearness and depth it had never reached when he 
was in health but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to 
some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again a 
new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived he thought as 
he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut gazing fixedly before him with feverish 
wide open eyes happiness lying beyond material forces outside the material influences that act on 
happiness of the soul alone the happiness of loving every man can understand it but 
to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for god but how did god 
enjoin that law and why was the son and suddenly the sequence of these thoughts 
broke off and prince andrew heard without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality 
a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating piti piti and then and then again 
piti piti and once more at the same time he felt that above his face 
above the very middle of it some strange airy structure was being erected out of 
slender needles or splinters to the sound of this whispered music he felt that he 
had to balance carefully though it was difficult so that this airy structure should not 
collapse but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered 
rhythmic stretches stretches spreading out and stretching said prince andrew to himself while listening to 
this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this 
edifice of needles he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle and 
heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against 
his pillow and his face each time the fly touched his face it gave him 
a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure though 
it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising but besides 
this there was something else of importance it was something white by the statue of 
a sphinx which also oppressed him perhaps my shirt on the table he thought my 
legs and that is the door but why is it always stretching and drawing itself 
out and piti and and piti enough please leave off prince andrew painfully entreated someone 
and suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar 
clearness and force he thought again quite clearly not love which loves for something for 
some quality for some purpose or for some reason but the love which experienced when 
i saw my enemy and yet loved him i experienced that feeling of love which 
is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object now again 
i feel that bliss to love neighbors to love enemies to love everything to love 
god in all his manifestations it is possible to love someone dear to you with 
human love but an enemy can only be loved by divine love that is why 
i experienced such joy when i felt that i loved that man what has become 
of him is he alive loving with human love one may pass from love to 
hatred but divine love cannot change no neither death nor anything else can destroy it 
it is the very essence of the soul yet how many people have i hated 
in my life and of them all i loved and hated none as i did 
her and he vividly pictured to himself natásha not as he had done in the 
past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight but for the first time 
picturing to himself her soul and he understood her feelings her sufferings shame and remorse 
he now understood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her 
the cruelty of his rupture with her only it were possible for me to see 
her once more just once looking into those eyes to say piti piti and ti 
ti and piti piti piti boom flopped the fly and his attention was suddenly carried 
into another world a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening 
in that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall something was 
still stretching out and the candle with its red halo was still burning and the 
same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door but besides all this something creaked there was 
a whiff of fresh air and a new white sphinx appeared standing at the door 
and that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very natásha of 
whom he had just been thinking how oppressive this continual delirium is thought prince andrew 
trying to drive that face from his imagination but the face remained before him with 
the force of reality and drew nearer prince andrew wished to return to that former 
world of pure thought but he could not and delirium drew him back into its 
domain the soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur something oppressed him and stretched out 
and the strange face was before him prince andrew collected all his strength in an 
effort to recover his senses he moved a little and suddenly there was a ringing 
in his ears a dimness in his eyes and like a man plunged into water 
he lost consciousness when he came to himself natásha that same living natásha whom of 
all people he most longed to love with this new pure divine love that had 
been revealed to him was kneeling before him he realized that it was the real 
living natásha and he was not surprised but quietly happy natásha motionless on her knees 
she was unable to stir with frightened eyes riveted on him was restraining her sobs 
her face was pale and rigid only in the lower part of it something quivered 
prince andrew sighed with relief smiled and held out his hand he said fortunate with 
a rapid but careful movement natásha drew nearer to him on her knees and taking 
his hand carefully bent her face over it and began kissing it just touching it 
lightly with her lips me she whispered raising her head and glancing at him me 
love you said prince andrew what he asked me for what i ha ve do 
ne faltered natásha in a scarcely audible broken whisper and began kissing his hand more 
rapidly just touching it with her lips love you more better than before said prince 
andrew lifting her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes those 
eyes filled with happy tears gazed at him timidly compassionately and with joyous love thin 
pale face with its swollen lips was more than was dreadful but prince andrew did 
not see that he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful they heard the sound 
of voices behind them peter the valet who was now wide awake had roused the 
doctor timókhin who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg 
had long been watching all that was going on carefully covering his bare body with 
the sheet as he huddled up on his bench this said the doctor rising from 
his bed go away madam at that moment a maid sent by the countess who 
had noticed her absence knocked at the door like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep 
natásha went out of the room and returning to her hut fell sobbing on her 
bed from that time during all the rest of the journey at every halting place 
and wherever they spent a night natásha never left the wounded bolkónski and the doctor 
had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness 
or such skill in nursing a wounded man dreadful as the countess imagined it would 
be should prince andrew die in her arms during the judging by what the doctor 
said it seemed might easily could not oppose natásha though with the intimacy now established 
between the wounded man and natásha the thought occurred that should he recover their former 
engagement would be renewed no of all natásha and prince of this the unsettled question 
of life and death which hung not only over bolkónski but over all russia shut 
out all other considerations chapter xxxiii on the third of september pierre awoke late his 
head was aching the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on 
his body and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done 
the day before that something shameful was his conversation with captain ramballe it was eleven 
by the clock but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors pierre rose rubbed his 
eyes and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which gerásim had replaced on the 
writing table he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day 
i not too late he thought probably he make his entry into moscow before noon 
pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him but hastened to 
act after arranging his clothes he took the pistol and was about to go out 
but it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not 
carry the weapon in his hand through the streets it was difficult to hide such 
a big pistol even under his wide coat he could not carry it unnoticed in 
his belt or under his arm besides it had been discharged and he had not 
had time to reload it matter the dagger will do he said to himself though 
when planning his design he had more than once come to the conclusion that the 
chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been to try to kill napoleon 
with a dagger but as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design 
but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing 
all he could to achieve it pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a 
green sheath which he had bought at the súkharev market with the pistol and hid 
it under his waistcoat having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap 
low on his head pierre went down the corridor trying to avoid making a noise 
or meeting the captain and passed out into the street the conflagration at which he 
had looked with so much indifference the evening before had greatly increased during the night 
moscow was on fire in several places the buildings in carriage row across the river 
in the bazaar and the povarskóy as well as the barges on the moskvá river 
and the timber yards by the dorogomílov bridge were all ablaze way led through side 
streets to the povarskóy and from there to the church of st nicholas on the 
arbát where he had long before decided that the deed should be done the gates 
of most of the houses were locked and the shutters up the streets and lanes 
were deserted the air was full of smoke and the smell of burning now and 
then he met russians with anxious and timid faces and frenchmen with an air not 
of the city but of the camp walking in the middle of the streets both 
the russians and the french looked at pierre with surprise besides his height and stoutness 
and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure the russians 
stared at pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong 
the french followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because pierre unlike all the 
other russians who gazed at the french with fear and curiosity paid no attention to 
them at the gate of one house three frenchmen who were explaining something to some 
russians who did not understand them stopped pierre asking if he did not know french 
pierre shook his head and went on in another side street a sentinel standing beside 
a green caisson shouted at him but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and 
he heard the click of the musket as he raised it did pierre understand that 
he had to pass on the other side of the street he heard nothing and 
saw nothing of what went on around him he carried his resolution within himself in 
terror and haste like something dreadful and alien to him for after the previous experience 
he was afraid of losing it but he was not destined to bring his mood 
safely to his destination and even had he not been hindered by anything on the 
way his intention could not now have been carried out for napoleon had passed the 
arbát more than four hours previously on his way from the dorogomílov suburb to the 
krémlin and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal 
study in the krémlin giving detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken 
immediately to extinguish the fire to prevent looting and to reassure the inhabitants but pierre 
did not know this he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him and was 
those are who obstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of 
its difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their the fear of weakening at the 
decisive moment and so losing his self esteem though he heard and saw nothing around 
him he found his way by instinct and did not go wrong in the side 
streets that led to the povarskóy as pierre approached that street the smoke became denser 
and even felt the heat of the fire occasionally curly tongues of flame rose from 
under the roofs of the houses he met more people in the streets and they 
were more excited but pierre though he felt that something unusual was happening around him 
did not realize that he was approaching the fire as he was going along a 
footpath across a wide open space adjoining the povarskóy on one side and the gardens 
of prince house on the other pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman 
close to him he stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head 
by the side of the path on the dusty dry grass all sorts of household 
goods lay in a heap featherbeds a samovar icons and trunks on the ground beside 
the trunks sat a thin woman no longer young with long prominent upper teeth and 
wearing a black cloak and cap this woman swaying to and fro and muttering something 
was choking with sobs two girls of about ten and twelve dressed in dirty short 
frocks and cloaks were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their 
pale frightened faces the youngest child a boy of about seven who wore an overcoat 
and an immense cap evidently not his own was crying in his old arms a 
dirty barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk and having undone her pale colored plait 
was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair the husband a short round 
shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official with sausage shaped whiskers and 
showing under his square set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over his temples with 
expressionless face was moving the trunks which were placed one on another and was dragging 
some garments from under them as soon as she saw pierre the woman almost threw 
herself at his feet people good christians save me help me dear friends help us 
somebody she muttered between her sobs girl my daughter my youngest daughter is left behind 
burned ooh was it for this i nursed you ooh mary nikoláevna said her husband 
to her in a low voice evidently only to justify himself before the stranger must 
have taken her or else where can she be he added villain shouted the woman 
angrily suddenly ceasing to weep have no heart you feel for your own child another 
man would have rescued her from the fire but this is a monster and neither 
a man nor a father you honored sir are a noble man she went on 
addressing pierre rapidly between her sobs fire broke out alongside and blew our way the 
maid called out and we rushed to collect our things we ran out just as 
we were this is what we have brought away the icons and my dowry bed 
all the rest is lost we seized the children but not katie ooh o lord 
and again she began to sob child my dear one burned burned where was she 
left asked pierre from the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this 
man might help her dear sir she cried seizing him by the legs benefactor set 
my heart at ease aníska go you horrid girl show him the way she cried 
to the maid angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long teeth me 
the way show me i do it gasped pierre rapidly the dirty maidservant stepped from 
behind the trunk put up her plait sighed and went on her short bare feet 
along the path pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a 
heavy swoon he held his head higher his eyes shone with the light of life 
and with swift steps he followed the maid overtook her and came out on the 
povarskóy the whole street was full of clouds of black smoke tongues of flame here 
and there broke through that cloud a great number of people crowded in front of 
the conflagration in the middle of the street stood a french general saying something to 
those around him pierre accompanied by the maid was advancing to the spot where the 
general stood but the french soldiers stopped him ne passe pas cried a voice pass 
way uncle cried the girl pass through the side street by the pierre turned back 
giving a spring now and then to keep up with her she ran across the 
street turned down a side street to the left and passing three houses turned into 
a yard on the right here close by said she and running across the yard 
opened a gate in a wooden fence and stopping pointed out to him a small 
wooden wing of the house which was burning brightly and fiercely one of its sides 
had fallen in another was on fire and bright flames issued from the openings of 
the windows and from under the roof as pierre passed through the fence gate he 
was enveloped by hot air and involuntarily stopped is it which is your house he 
asked wailed the girl pointing to the wing it that was our lodging burned to 
death our treasure katie my precious little missy ooh lamented aníska who at the sight 
of the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings pierre rushed 
to the wing but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in 
a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet burning only at 
one end just below the roof and around which swarmed a crowd of frenchmen at 
first pierre did not realize what these men who were dragging something out were about 
but seeing before him a frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying 
to take from him a fox fur coat he vaguely understood that looting was going 
on there but he had no time to dwell on that idea the sounds of 
crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings the whistle and hiss of the 
flames the excited shouts of the people and the sight of the swaying smoke now 
gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks with here and 
there dense sheaves of flame now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along 
the walls and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion produced on pierre the 
usual animating effects of a conflagration it had a peculiarly strong effect on him because 
at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas that 
had weighed him down he felt young bright adroit and resolute he ran round to 
the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of 
it which was still standing when just above his head he heard several voices shouting 
and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him 
pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some frenchmen who 
had just thrown out the drawer of a chest filled with metal articles other french 
soldiers standing below went up to the drawer does this fellow want shouted one of 
them referring to pierre a child in that house you seen a child cried pierre 
he talking about get along said several voices and one of the soldiers evidently afraid 
that pierre might want to take from them some of the plate and bronzes that 
were in the drawer moved threateningly toward him child shouted a frenchman from above did 
hear something squealing in the garden perhaps his brat that the fellow is looking for 
after all one must be human you know is it where said pierre there shouted 
the frenchman at the window pointing to the garden at the back of the house 
a coming down and a minute or two later the frenchman a black eyed fellow 
with a spot on his cheek in shirt sleeves really did jump out of a 
window on the ground floor and clapping pierre on the shoulder ran with him into 
the garden up you others he called out to his comrades getting hot when they 
reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchman pulled pierre by the arm and 
pointed to a round graveled space where a three year old girl in a pink 
dress was lying under a seat is your child oh a girl so much the 
better said the frenchman by fatty we must be human we are all mortal you 
know and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades 
breathless with joy pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take her 
in his arms but seeing a stranger the sickly scrofulous looking child unattractively like her 
mother began to yell and run away pierre however seized her and lifted her in 
his arms she screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull 
hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth pierre was seized by a 
sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little 
animal but he made an effort not to throw the child down and ran with 
her to the large house it was now however impossible to get back the way 
he had come the maid aníska was no longer there and pierre with a feeling 
of pity and disgust pressed the wet painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as 
he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out chapter xxxiv 
having run through different yards and side streets pierre got back with his little burden 
to the gruzínski garden at the corner of the povarskóy he did not at first 
recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the child so 
crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the 
houses besides russian families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings 
there were several french soldiers in a variety of clothing pierre took no notice of 
them he hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore 
the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else pierre felt that he 
had still much to do and to do quickly glowing with the heat and from 
running he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth animation 
and determination that had come on him when he ran to save the child she 
had now become quiet and clinging with her little hands to coat sat on his 
arm gazing about her like some little wild animal he glanced at her occasionally with 
a slight smile he fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened sickly little 
face he did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left 
them he walked among the crowd with rapid steps scanning the various faces he met 
involuntarily he noticed a georgian or armenian family consisting of a very handsome old man 
of oriental type wearing a new cloth covered sheepskin coat and new boots an old 
woman of similar type and a young woman that very young woman seemed to pierre 
the perfection of oriental beauty with her sharply outlined arched black eyebrows and the extraordinarily 
soft bright color of her long beautiful expressionless face amid the scattered property and the 
crowd on the open space she in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac 
shawl on her head suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow she 
was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman and looked from under 
her long lashes with motionless large almond shaped eyes at the ground before her evidently 
she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it her face struck pierre 
and hurrying along by the fence he turned several times to look at her when 
he had reached the fence still without finding those he sought he stopped and looked 
about him with the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than 
before and a group of russians both men and women gathered about him you lost 
anyone my dear fellow of the gentry yourself you whose child is it they asked 
him pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who 
had been sitting there with her other children and he asked whether anyone knew where 
she had gone that must be the anférovs said an old deacon addressing a pockmarked 
peasant woman have mercy lord have mercy he added in his customary bass anférovs no 
said the woman left in the morning that must be either mary or the says 
woman and mary nikoláevna is a lady remarked a house serf you know her thin 
with long teeth said pierre mary nikoláevna they went inside the garden when these wolves 
swooped down said the woman pointing to the french soldiers lord have mercy added the 
deacon over that way there she she kept on lamenting and crying continued the woman 
she here this way but pierre was not listening to the woman he had for 
some seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away he was 
looking at the armenian family and at two french soldiers who had gone up to 
them one of these a nimble little man was wearing a blue coat tied round 
the waist with a rope he had a nightcap on his head and his feet 
were bare the other whose appearance particularly struck pierre was a long lank round shouldered 
fair haired man slow in his movements and with an idiotic expression of face he 
wore a loose gown of frieze blue trousers and large torn hessian boots the little 
barefooted frenchman in the blue coat went up to the armenians and saying something immediately 
seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling 
off his boots the other in the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful 
armenian girl and with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her motionless and 
silent take the child said pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the woman handing the little 
girl to her her back to them give her back he almost shouted putting the 
child who began screaming on the ground and again looking at the frenchman and the 
armenian family the old man was already sitting barefoot the little frenchman had secured his 
second boot and was slapping one boot against the other the old man was saying 
something in a voice broken by sobs but pierre caught but a glimpse of this 
his whole attention was directed to the frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile swaying 
slowly from side to side had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his 
hands from his pockets had seized her by the neck the beautiful armenian still sat 
motionless and in the same attitude with her long lashes drooping as if she did 
not see or feel what the soldier was doing to her while pierre was running 
the few steps that separated him from the frenchman the tall marauder in the frieze 
gown was already tearing from her neck the necklace the young armenian was wearing and 
the young woman clutching at her neck screamed piercingly that woman alone exclaimed pierre hoarsely 
in a furious voice seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside 
the soldier fell got up and ran away but his comrade throwing down the boots 
and drawing his sword moved threateningly toward pierre pas de bêtises he cried here no 
nonsense pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and his 
strength increased tenfold he rushed at the barefooted frenchman and before the latter had time 
to draw his sword knocked him off his feet and hammered him with his fists 
shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around and at the same moment a 
mounted patrol of french uhlans appeared from round the corner the uhlans came up at 
a trot to pierre and the frenchman and surrounded them pierre remembered nothing of what 
happened after that he only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that 
his hands were bound and that a crowd of french soldiers stood around him and 
were searching him he has a dagger were the first words pierre understood a weapon 
said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with pierre 
right you can tell all about it at the court martial then he turned to 
pierre you speak french pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply 
his face probably looked very terrible for the officer said something in a whisper and 
four more uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of pierre you 
speak french the officer asked again keeping at a distance from pierre the interpreter a 
little man in russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks and by his clothes 
and manner of speaking pierre at once knew him to be a french salesman from 
one of the moscow shops does not look like a common man said the interpreter 
after a searching look at pierre he looks very much like an incendiary remarked the 
officer ask him who he is he added are you asked the interpreter in poor 
russian must answer the chief will not tell you who i am i am your 
me pierre suddenly replied in french ah muttered the officer with a frown then march 
a crowd had collected round the uhlans nearest to pierre stood the pockmarked peasant woman 
with the little girl and when the patrol started she moved forward are they taking 
you to you poor dear said she the little girl the little girl what am 
i to do with her if not theirs said the woman does that woman want 
asked the officer pierre was as if intoxicated his elation increased at the sight of 
the little girl he had saved does she want he murmured is bringing me my 
daughter whom i have just saved from the flames said he by and without knowing 
how this aimless lie had escaped him he went along with resolute and triumphant steps 
between the french soldiers the french patrol was one of those sent out through the 
various streets of moscow by order to put a stop to the pillage and especially 
to catch the incendiaries who according to the general opinion which had that day originated 
among the higher french officers were the cause of the conflagrations after marching through a 
number of streets the patrol arrested five more russian suspects a small shopkeeper two seminary 
students a peasant and a house serf besides several looters but of all these various 
suspected characters pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all when they had 
all been brought for the night to a large house on the zúbov rampart that 
was being used as a guardhouse pierre was placed apart under strict guard book twelve 
1812 chapter i in petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on 
with greater heat than ever in the highest circles between the parties of rumyántsev the 
french márya fëdorovna the tsarévich and others drowned as usual by the buzzing of the 
court drones but the calm luxurious life of petersburg concerned only about phantoms and reflections 
of real life went on in its old way and made it hard except by 
a great effort to realize the danger and the difficult position of the russian people 
there were the same receptions and balls the same french theater the same court interests 
and service interests and intrigues as usual only in the very highest circles were attempts 
made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position stories were whispered of 
how differently the two empresses behaved in these difficult circumstances the empress márya concerned for 
the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her patronage had given directions that 
they should all be removed to kazán and the things belonging to these institutions had 
already been packed up the empress elisabeth however when asked what instructions she would be 
pleased to her characteristic russian patriotism had replied that she could give no directions about 
state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign but as far as she 
personally was concerned she would be the last to quit petersburg at anna on the 
twenty sixth of august the very day of the battle of borodinó there was a 
soiree the chief feature of which was to be the reading of a letter from 
his lordship the bishop when sending the emperor an icon of the venerable sergius it 
was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical patriotic eloquence prince vasíli himself famed for his 
elocution was to read it he used to read at the the art of his 
reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words quite independently of their meaning 
in a loud and singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a tender murmur 
so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and the murmur on 
another this reading as was always the case at anna soirees had a political significance 
that evening she expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of their 
visits to the french theater and aroused to a patriotic temper a good many people 
had already arrived but anna pávlovna not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in 
her drawing room did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of 
a general conversation the news of the day in petersburg was the illness of countess 
bezúkhova she had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously had missed several gatherings of 
which she was usually the ornament and was said to be receiving no one and 
instead of the celebrated petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some 
italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way they all knew 
very well that the enchanting illness arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands 
at the same time and that the cure consisted in removing such inconvenience but in 
anna presence no one dared to think of this or even appear to know it 
say the poor countess is very ill the doctor says it is angina pectoris oh 
a terrible illness say that the rivals are reconciled thanks to the angina and the 
word angina was repeated with great satisfaction count is pathetic they say he cried like 
a child when the doctor told him the case was dangerous it would be a 
terrible loss she is an enchanting woman are speaking of the poor countess said anna 
pávlovna coming up just then sent to ask for news and hear that she is 
a little better oh she is certainly the most charming woman in the world she 
went on with a smile at her own enthusiasm belong to different camps but that 
does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves she is very unfortunate added anna 
pávlovna supposing that by these words anna pávlovna was somewhat lifting the veil from the 
secret of the malady an unwary young man ventured to express surprise that well known 
doctors had not been called in and that the countess was being attended by a 
charlatan who might employ dangerous remedies information may be better than mine anna pávlovna suddenly 
and venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man i know on good authority that this 
doctor is a very learned and able man he is private physician to the queen 
of spain and having thus demolished the young man anna pávlovna turned to another group 
where bilíbin was talking about the austrians having wrinkled up his face he was evidently 
preparing to smooth it out again and utter one of his mots think it is 
delightful he said referring to a diplomatic note that had been sent to vienna with 
some austrian banners captured from the french by wittgenstein hero of as he was then 
called in petersburg that asked anna pávlovna securing silence for the mot which she had 
heard before and bilíbin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch which he had 
himself composed emperor returns these austrian banners said bilíbin banners gone astray and found on 
a wrong path and his brow became smooth again charming observed prince vasíli path to 
warsaw perhaps prince hippolyte remarked loudly and unexpectedly everybody looked at him understanding what he 
meant prince hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise he knew no more than the 
others what his words meant during his diplomatic career he had more than once noticed 
that such utterances were received as very witty and at every opportunity he uttered in 
that way the first words that entered his head may turn out very well he 
thought if not know how to arrange matters and really during the awkward silence that 
ensued that insufficiently patriotic person entered whom anna pávlovna had been waiting for and wished 
to convert and she smiling and shaking a finger at hippolyte invited prince vasíli to 
the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin everyone 
became silent gracious sovereign and emperor prince vasíli sternly declaimed looking round at his audience 
as if to inquire whether anyone had anything to say to the contrary but no 
one said anything our ancient capital the new jerusalem receives her placed a sudden emphasis 
on the word a mother receives her zealous sons into her arms and through the 
gathering mists foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy rule sings in exultation blessed is he 
that cometh prince vasíli pronounced these last words in a tearful voice bilíbin attentively examined 
his nails and many of those present appeared intimidated as if asking in what they 
were to blame anna pávlovna whispered the next words in advance like an old woman 
muttering the prayer at communion the bold and insolent goliath she whispered prince vasíli continued 
the bold and insolent goliath from the borders of france encompass the realms of russia 
with death bearing terrors humble faith the sling of the russian david shall suddenly smite 
his head in his bloodthirsty pride this icon of the venerable sergius the servant of 
god and zealous champion of old of our weal is offered to your imperial majesty 
i grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious 
presence i raise fervent prayers to heaven that the almighty may exalt the race of 
the just and mercifully fulfill the desires of your majesty force what a style was 
uttered in approval both of reader and of author animated by that address anna guests 
talked for a long time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures 
as to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days will 
see said anna pávlovna tomorrow on the birthday we shall receive news i have a 
favorable presentiment chapter ii anna presentiment was in fact fulfilled next day during the service 
at the palace church in honor of the birthday prince volkónski was called out of 
the church and received a dispatch from prince kutúzov it was report written from tatárinova 
on the day of the battle kutúzov wrote that the russians had not retreated a 
step that the french losses were much heavier than ours and that he was writing 
in haste from the field of battle before collecting full information it followed that there 
must have been a victory and at once without leaving the church thanks were rendered 
to the creator for his help and for the victory anna presentiment was justified and 
all that morning a joyously festive mood reigned in the city everyone believed the victory 
to have been complete and some even spoke of having been captured of his deposition 
and of the choice of a new ruler for france it is very difficult for 
events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court 
life and far from the scene of action general events involuntarily group themselves around some 
particular incident so now the pleasure was based as much on the fact that the 
news had arrived on the birthday as on the fact of the victory itself it 
was like a successfully arranged surprise mention was made in report of the russian losses 
among which figured the names of túchkov bagratión and kutáysov in the petersburg world this 
sad side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single incident death everybody knew 
him the emperor liked him and he was young and interesting that day everyone met 
with the words a wonderful coincidence just during the service but what a loss kutáysov 
is how sorry i am did i tell about kutúzov prince vasíli now said with 
a pride always said he was the only man capable of defeating napoleon but next 
day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew anxious the courtiers 
suffered because of the suffering the suspense occasioned the emperor the position said they and 
instead of extolling kutúzov as they had done the day before they condemned him as 
the cause of the anxiety that day prince vasíli no longer boasted of his protégé 
kutúzov but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned moreover toward evening as 
if everything conspired to make petersburg society anxious and uneasy a terrible piece of news 
was added countess hélène bezúkhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been 
so agreeable to mention officially at large gatherings everyone said that countess bezúkhova had died 
of a terrible attack of angina pectoris but in intimate circles details were mentioned of 
how the private physician of the queen of spain had prescribed small doses of a 
certain drug to produce a certain effect but hélène tortured by the fact that the 
old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written that wretched 
profligate pierre had not replied had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug 
and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her it was said that 
prince vasíli and the old count had turned upon the italian but the latter had 
produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop 
talk in general centered round three melancholy facts the lack of news the loss of 
kutáysov and the death of hélène on the third day after report a country gentleman 
arrived from moscow and news of the surrender of moscow to the french spread through 
the whole town this was terrible what a position for the emperor to be in 
kutúzov was a traitor and prince vasíli during the visits of condolence paid to him 
on the occasion of his death said of kutúzov whom he had formerly praised it 
was excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said that it 
was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old man only wonder 
that the fate of russia could have been entrusted to such a man as long 
as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it but the next day 
the following communication was received from count rostopchín prince adjutant has brought me a letter 
in which he demands police officers to guide the army to the ryazán road he 
writes that he is regretfully abandoning moscow sire action decides the fate of the capital 
and of your empire russia will shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city 
in which her greatness is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors 
i shall follow the army i have had everything removed and it only remains for 
me to weep over the fate of my fatherland on receiving this dispatch the emperor 
sent prince volkónski to kutúzov with the following rescript prince michael ilariónovich since the twenty 
ninth of august i have received no communication from you yet on the first of 
september i received from the commander in chief of moscow via yaroslávl the sad news 
that you with the army have decided to abandon moscow you can yourself imagine the 
effect this news has had on me and your silence increases my astonishment i am 
sending this by adjutant general prince volkónski to hear from you the situation of the 
army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy decision chapter iii 
nine days after the abandonment of moscow a messenger from kutúzov reached petersburg with the 
official announcement of that event this messenger was michaud a frenchman who did not know 
russian but who was quoique étranger russe de cœur et as he said of himself 
though a foreigner russian in heart and soul the emperor at once received this messenger 
in his study at the palace on stone island michaud who had never seen moscow 
before the campaign and who did not know russian yet felt deeply moved as he 
wrote when he appeared before notre très gracieux souverain with the news of the burning 
of moscow dont les flammes éclairaient sa route 2 our most gracious sovereign 2 whose 
flames illumined his route though the source of m chagrin must have been different from 
that which caused russians to grieve he had such a sad face when shown into 
the study that the latter at once asked you brought me sad news colonel sad 
sire replied michaud lowering his eyes with a sigh abandonment of moscow they surrendered my 
ancient capital without a battle asked the emperor quickly his face suddenly flushing michaud respectfully 
delivered the message kutúzov had entrusted to him which was that it had been impossible 
to fight before moscow and that as the only remaining choice was between losing the 
army as well as moscow or losing moscow alone the field marshal had to choose 
the latter the emperor listened in silence not looking at michaud the enemy entered the 
city he asked sire and moscow is now in ashes i left it all in 
flames replied michaud in a decided tone but glancing at the emperor he was frightened 
by what he had done the emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly his lower 
lip trembled and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes but this lasted only 
a moment he suddenly frowned as if blaming himself for his weakness and raising his 
head addressed michaud in a firm voice see colonel from all that is happening that 
providence requires great sacrifices of us i am ready to submit myself in all things 
to his will but tell me michaud how did you leave the army when it 
saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle did you not notice discouragement seeing that 
his most gracious ruler was calm once more michaud also grew calm but was not 
immediately ready to reply to the direct and relevant question which required a direct answer 
will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier he asked to 
gain time i always require it replied the emperor nothing from me i wish to 
know absolutely how things are said michaud with a subtle scarcely perceptible smile on his 
lips having now prepared a well phrased reply i left the whole army from its 
chiefs to the lowest soldier without exception in desperate and agonized terror is that the 
emperor interrupted him frowning sternly misfortune make my russians lose heart never michaud had only 
waited for this to bring out the phrase he had prepared he said with respectful 
playfulness are only afraid lest your majesty in the goodness of your heart should allow 
yourself to be persuaded to make peace they are burning for the combat declared this 
representative of the russian nation to prove to your majesty by the sacrifice of their 
lives how devoted they are said the emperor reassured and with a kindly gleam in 
his eyes he patted michaud on the shoulder set me at ease colonel he bent 
his head and was silent for some time then go back to the army he 
said drawing himself up to his full height and addressing michaud with a gracious and 
majestic gesture tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that 
when i have not a soldier left i shall put myself at the head of 
my beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of my 
empire it still offers me more than my enemies suppose said the emperor growing more 
and more animated should it ever be ordained by divine providence he continued raising to 
heaven his fine eyes shining with emotion my dynasty should cease to reign on the 
throne of my ancestors then after exhausting all the means at my command i shall 
let my beard grow to he pointed halfway down his chest go and eat potatoes 
with the meanest of my peasants rather than sign the disgrace of my country and 
of my beloved people whose sacrifices i know how to appreciate having uttered these words 
in an agitated voice the emperor suddenly turned away as if to hide from michaud 
the tears that rose to his eyes and went to the further end of his 
study having stood there a few moments he strode back to michaud and pressed his 
arm below the elbow with a vigorous movement the mild and handsome face was flushed 
and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger michaud do not forget what i say 
to you here perhaps we may recall it with pleasure someday napoleon or i said 
the emperor touching his breast can no longer both reign together i have learned to 
know him and he will not deceive me any more and the emperor paused with 
a frown when he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in 
the eyes étranger russe de cœur et that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all 
that he had heard as he used afterwards to say and gave expression to his 
own feelings and those of the russian people whose representative he considered himself to be 
in the following words said he majesty is at this moment signing the glory of 
the nation and the salvation of europe with an inclination of the head the emperor 
dismissed him chapter iv it is natural for us who were not living in those 
days to imagine that when half russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing 
to distant provinces and one levy after another was being raised for the defense of 
the fatherland all russians from the greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing 
themselves saving their fatherland or weeping over its downfall the tales and descriptions of that 
time without exception speak only of the self sacrifice patriotic devotion despair grief and the 
heroism of the russians but it was not really so it appears so to us 
because we see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see 
all the personal human interests that people had yet in reality those personal interests of 
the moment so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the public interest 
from being felt or even noticed most of the people at that time paid no 
attention to the general progress of events but were guided only by their private interests 
and they were the very people whose activities at that period were most useful those 
who tried to understand the general course of events and to take part in it 
by self sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members of society they saw everything 
upside down and all they did for the common good turned out to be useless 
and and regiments which looted russian villages and the lint the young ladies prepared and 
that never reached the wounded and so on even those fond of intellectual talk and 
of expressing their feelings who discussed position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation 
either a shade of pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed against people 
accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty of in historic events the rule 
forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is specially applicable 
only unconscious action bears fruit and he who plays a part in an historic event 
never understands its significance if he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless the 
more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in russia the 
less did he realize their significance in petersburg and in the provinces at a distance 
from moscow ladies and gentlemen in militia uniforms wept for russia and its ancient capital 
and talked of self sacrifice and so on but in the army which retired beyond 
moscow there was little talk or thought of moscow and when they caught sight of 
its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the french but they thought 
about their next pay their next quarters of matrëshka the vivandière and like matters as 
the war had caught him in the service nicholas rostóv took a close and prolonged 
part in the defense of his country but did so casually without any aim at 
self sacrifice and he therefore looked at what was going on in russia without despair 
and without dismally racking his brains over it had he been asked what he thought 
of the state of russia he would have said that it was not his business 
to think about it that kutúzov and others were there for that purpose but that 
he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength 
that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet and that things being 
so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a 
couple of time as he looked at the matter in this way he learned that 
he was being sent to vorónezh to buy remounts for his division not only without 
regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle but with the greatest 
he did not conceal and which his comrades fully understood a few days before the 
battle of borodinó nicholas received the necessary money and warrants and having sent some hussars 
on in advance he set out with post horses for vorónezh only a man who 
has experienced is has passed some months continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and understand 
the delight nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the foraging operations 
provision trains and hospitals from soldiers wagons and the filthy traces of a saw villages 
with peasants and peasant women country houses fields where cattle were grazing posthouses with stationmasters 
asleep in them he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time what 
for a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women young and healthy 
without a dozen officers making up to each of them women too who were pleased 
and flattered that a passing officer should joke with them in the highest spirits nicholas 
arrived at night at a hotel in vorónezh ordered things he had long been deprived 
of in camp and next day very clean shaven and in a full dress uniform 
he had not worn for a long time went to present himself to the authorities 
the commander of the militia was a civilian general an old man who was evidently 
pleased with his military designation and rank he received nicholas brusquely imagining this to be 
characteristically military and questioned him with an important air as if considering the general progress 
of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do so nicholas was in 
such good spirits that this merely amused him from the commander of the militia he 
drove to the governor the governor was a brisk little man very simple and affable 
he indicated the stud farms at which nicholas might procure horses recommended to him a 
horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had 
the best horses and promised to assist him in every way are count ilyá son 
my wife was a great friend of your we are at home on is thursday 
so please come and see us quite informally said the governor taking leave of him 
immediately on leaving the nicholas hired post horses and taking his squadron quartermaster with him 
drove at a gallop to the landowner fourteen miles away who had the stud everything 
seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in vorónezh 
and as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind everything 
went well and easily the landowner to whom nicholas went was a bachelor an old 
cavalryman a horse fancier a sportsman the possessor of some century old brandy and some 
old hungarian wine who had a snuggery where he smoked and who owned some splendid 
horses in very few words nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six thousand serve as 
he said as samples of his remounts after dining and taking rather too much of 
the hungarian wine exchanged kisses with the landowner with whom he was already on the 
friendliest back over abominable roads in the brightest frame of mind continually urging on the 
driver so as to be in time for the party when he had changed poured 
water over his head and scented himself nicholas arrived at the rather late but with 
the phrase late than on his lips it was not a ball nor had dancing 
been announced but everyone knew that catherine petróvna would play valses and the écossaise on 
the clavichord and that there would be dancing and so everyone had come as to 
a ball provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual but with this 
difference that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the arrival of many 
wealthy families from moscow and as in everything that went on in russia at that 
time a special recklessness was noticeable an for a penny in for a cares spirit 
and the inevitable small talk instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances now 
turned on moscow the army and napoleon the society gathered together at the was the 
best in vorónezh there were a great many ladies and some of moscow acquaintances but 
there were no men who could at all vie with the cavalier of st george 
the hussar remount officer the good natured and well bred count rostóv among the men 
was an italian prisoner an officer of the french army and nicholas felt that the 
presence of that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a russian hero the italian was 
as it were a war trophy nicholas felt this it seemed to him that everyone 
regarded the italian in the same light and he treated him cordially though with dignity 
and restraint as soon as nicholas entered in his hussar uniform diffusing around him a 
fragrance of perfume and wine and had uttered the words late than and heard them 
repeated several times by others people clustered around him all eyes turned on him and 
he felt at once that he had entered into his proper position in the of 
a universal favorite a very pleasant position and intoxicatingly so after his long privations at 
posting stations at inns and in the snuggery maidservants had been flattered by his notice 
and here too at the party there were as it seemed to nicholas an inexhaustible 
number of pretty young women married and unmarried impatiently awaiting his notice the women and 
girls flirted with him and from the first day the people concerned themselves to get 
this fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down among these was the 
wife herself who welcomed rostóv as a near relative and called him catherine petróvna did 
actually play valses and the écossaise and dancing began in which nicholas still further captivated 
the provincial society by his agility his particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them 
all nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening he had 
never danced like that in moscow and would even have considered such a very free 
and easy manner improper and in bad form but here he felt it incumbent on 
him to astonish them all by something unusual something they would have to accept as 
the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces all the 
evening nicholas paid attention to a blue eyed plump and pleasing little blonde the wife 
of one of the provincial officials with the naïve conviction of young men in a 
merry mood that other wives were created for them rostóv did not leave the side 
and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style as if without speaking of 
it they knew how capitally nicholas and the lady would get on together the husband 
however did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with rostóv 
but the good natured naïveté was so boundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to 
good humor toward the end of the evening however as the face grew more flushed 
and animated the became more and more melancholy and solemn as though there were but 
a given amount of animation between them and as the share increased the diminished chapter 
v nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair bending closely over the blonde lady 
and paying her mythological compliments with a smile that never left his face jauntily shifting 
the position of his legs in their tight riding breeches diffusing an odor of perfume 
and admiring his partner himself and the fine outlines of his legs in their well 
fitting hessian boots nicholas told the blonde lady that he wished to run away with 
a certain lady here in vorónezh lady charming lady a divine one her nicholas looked 
at his partner blue her mouth coral and ivory her he glanced at her shoulders 
the husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking about nikíta 
iványch cried nicholas rising politely and as if wishing nikíta iványch to share his joke 
he began to tell him of his intention to elope with a blonde lady the 
husband smiled gloomily the wife gaily the good natured wife came up with a look 
of disapproval ignátyevna wants to see you nicholas said she pronouncing the name so that 
nicholas at once understood that anna ignátyevna was a very important person nicholas you know 
you let me call you so yes aunt who is she ignátyevna malvíntseva she has 
heard from her niece how you rescued her can you guess rescued such a lot 
of them said nicholas niece princess bolkónskaya she is here in vorónezh with her aunt 
oho how you blush why are a bit please aunt well very well oh what 
a fellow you are the wife led him up to a tall and very stout 
old lady with a blue headdress who had just finished her game of cards with 
the most important personages of the town this was malvíntseva princess aunt on her side 
a rich childless widow who always lived in vorónezh when rostóv approached her she was 
standing settling up for the game she looked at him and screwing up her eyes 
sternly continued to upbraid the general who had won from her pleased mon cher she 
then said holding out her hand to nicholas come and see me after a few 
words about princess mary and her late father whom malvíntseva had evidently not liked and 
having asked what nicholas knew of prince andrew who also was evidently no favorite of 
hers the important old lady dismissed nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see 
her nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed at the mention of 
princess mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear which he himself 
did not understand when he had parted from malvíntseva nicholas wished to return to the 
dancing but the little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve and saying that 
she wanted to have a talk with him led him to her sitting room from 
which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way 
you know dear boy began the wife with a serious expression on her kind little 
face really would be the match for you would you like me to arrange it 
do you mean aunt asked nicholas will make a match for you with the princess 
catherine petróvna speaks of lily but i say princess do you want me to do 
it i am sure your mother will be grateful to me what a charming girl 
she is really and she is not at all so plain either at all replied 
nicholas as if offended at the idea befits a soldier aunt i force myself on 
anyone or refuse anything he said before he had time to consider what he was 
saying then remember this is not a joke course not yes the wife said as 
if talking to herself my dear boy among other things you are too attentive to 
the other the blonde one is sorry for the husband really no we are good 
friends with him said nicholas in the simplicity of his heart it did not enter 
his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone 
else what nonsense i have been saying to the wife thought nicholas suddenly at supper 
will really begin to arrange a match and sónya and on taking leave of the 
wife when she again smilingly said to him then remember he drew her aside see 
here to tell the truth aunt is it my dear come sit down here said 
she nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate thoughts which 
he would not have told to his mother his sister or his friend to this 
woman who was almost a stranger when he afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and 
inexplicable frankness which had very important results for him it seemed to it seems to 
everyone in such it was merely some silly whim that seized him yet that burst 
of frankness together with other trifling events had immense consequences for him and for all 
his family see aunt mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress but the 
very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me yes i understand said the 
wife princess another matter i will tell you the truth in the first place i 
like her very much i feel drawn to her and then after i met her 
under such strangely the idea often occurred to me is fate especially if you remember 
that mamma had long been thinking of it but i had never happened to meet 
her before somehow it had always happened that we did not meet and as long 
as my sister natásha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of 
the question for me to think of marrying her and it must needs happen that 
i should meet her just when engagement had been broken off and then everything so 
you see i never told this to anyone and never will only to you the 
wife pressed his elbow gratefully know sónya my cousin i love her and promised to 
marry her and will do so so you see there can be no question said 
nicholas incoherently and blushing dear boy what a way to look at it you know 
sónya has nothing and you yourself say your affairs are in a very bad way 
and what about your mother it would kill her one thing and what sort of 
life would it be for a girl with a heart your mother in despair and 
you all ruined no my dear you and sónya ought to understand that nicholas remained 
silent it comforted him to hear these arguments the same aunt it is impossible he 
rejoined with a sigh after a short pause would the princess have me and besides 
she is now in mourning how can one think of it you suppose going to 
get you married at once there is always a right way of doing things replied 
the wife a matchmaker you are aunt said nicholas kissing her plump little hand chapter 
vi on reaching moscow after her meeting with rostóv princess mary had found her nephew 
there with his tutor and a letter from prince andrew giving her instructions how to 
get to her aunt malvíntseva at vorónezh that feeling akin to temptation which had tormented 
her during her illness since his death and especially since her meeting with rostóv was 
smothered by arrangements for the journey anxiety about her brother settling in a new house 
meeting new people and attending to her education she was sad now after a month 
passed in quiet surroundings she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father 
which was associated in her mind with the ruin of russia she was agitated and 
incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother the only intimate 
person now remaining to her was exposed she was worried too about her education for 
which she had always felt herself incompetent but in the depths of her soul she 
felt at peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams and hopes that 
had been on the point of awakening within her and were related to her meeting 
with rostóv the day after her party the wife came to see malvíntseva and after 
discussing her plan with the aunt remarked that though under present circumstances a formal betrothal 
was of course not to be thought of all the same the young people might 
be brought together and could get to know one another malvíntseva expressed approval and the 
wife began to speak of rostóv in presence praising him and telling how he had 
blushed when princess name was mentioned but princess mary experienced a painful rather than a 
joyful mental tranquillity was destroyed and desires doubts self reproach and hopes reawoke during the 
two days that elapsed before rostóv called princess mary continually thought of how she ought 
to behave to him first she decided not to come to the drawing room when 
he called to see her it would not be proper for her in her deep 
mourning to receive visitors then she thought this would be rude after what he had 
done for her then it occurred to her that her aunt and the wife had 
intentions concerning herself and looks and words at times seemed to confirm this she told 
herself that only she with her sinful nature could think this of them they could 
not forget that situated as she was while still wearing deep mourning such matchmaking would 
be an insult to her and to her memory assuming that she did go down 
to see him princess mary imagined the words he would say to her and what 
she would say to him and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold and then to 
mean too much more than anything she feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm 
her and betray her as soon as she saw him but when on sunday after 
church the footman announced in the drawing room that count rostóv had called the princess 
showed no confusion only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up 
with a new and radiant light have met him aunt said she in a calm 
voice unable herself to understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural when 
rostóv entered the room the princess dropped her eyes for an instant as if to 
give the visitor time to greet her aunt and then just as nicholas turned to 
her she raised her head and met his look with shining eyes with a movement 
full of dignity and grace she half rose with a smile of pleasure held out 
her slender delicate hand to him and began to speak in a voice in which 
for the first time new deep womanly notes vibrated mademoiselle bourienne who was in the 
drawing room looked at princess mary in bewildered surprise herself a consummate coquette she could 
not have maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract black is particularly 
becoming to her or she really has greatly improved without my having noticed it and 
above all what tact and grace thought mademoiselle bourienne had princess mary been capable of 
reflection at that moment she would have been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at the 
change that had taken place in herself from the moment she recognized that dear loved 
face a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to speak and 
act apart from her own will from the time rostóv entered her face became suddenly 
transformed it was as if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted 
lantern and the intricate skillful artistic work on its sides that previously seemed dark coarse 
and meaningless was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty for the first time 
all that pure spiritual inward travail through which she had lived appeared on the surface 
all her inward labor her dissatisfaction with herself her sufferings her strivings after goodness her 
meekness love and self this now shone in those radiant eyes in her delicate smile 
and in every trait of her gentle face rostóv saw all this as clearly as 
if he had known her whole life he felt that the being before him was 
quite different from and better than anyone he had met before and above all better 
than himself their conversation was very simple and unimportant they spoke of the war and 
like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it they spoke of their last trying 
to change the talked of the kind wife of relations and of princess she did 
not talk about her brother diverting the conversation as soon as her aunt mentioned andrew 
evidently she could speak of misfortunes with a certain artificiality but her brother was too 
near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him nicholas noticed 
this as he noticed every shade of princess character with an observation unusual to him 
and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being nicholas 
blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the princess as she did 
when he was mentioned and even when he thought of her but in her presence 
he felt quite at ease and said not at all what he had prepared but 
what quite appropriately occurred to him at the moment when a pause occurred during his 
short visit nicholas as is usual when there are children turned to prince little son 
caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar he took the 
boy on his knee played with him and looked round at princess mary with a 
softened happy timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the 
man she loved nicholas also noticed that look and as if understanding it flushed with 
pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness as she was in 
mourning princess mary did not go out into society and nicholas did not think it 
the proper thing to visit her again but all the same the wife went on 
with her matchmaking passing on to nicholas the flattering things princess mary said of him 
and vice versa and insisting on his declaring himself to princess mary for this purpose 
she arranged a meeting between the young people at the house before mass though rostóv 
told the wife that he would not make any declaration to princess mary he promised 
to go as at tilsit rostóv had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody 
considered right was right so now after a short but sincere struggle between his effort 
to arrange his life by his own sense of justice and in obedient submission to 
circumstances he chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him 
he knew not where he knew that after his promise to sónya it would be 
what he deemed base to declare his feelings to princess mary and he knew that 
he would never act basely but he also knew or rather felt at the bottom 
of his heart that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to 
those who were guiding him he was not only doing nothing wrong but was doing 
something very important than anything he had ever done in his life after meeting princess 
mary though the course of his life went on externally as before all his former 
amusements lost their charm for him and he often thought about her but he never 
thought about her as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom 
he had met in society nor as he had for a long time and at 
one time rapturously thought about sónya he had pictured each of those young ladies as 
almost all honest hearted young men do that is as a possible wife adapting her 
in his imagination to all the conditions of married life a white dressing gown his 
wife at the tea table his carriage little ones mamma and papa their relations to 
her and so these pictures of the future had given him pleasure but with princess 
mary to whom they were trying to get him engaged he could never picture anything 
of future married life if he tried his pictures seemed incongruous and false it made 
him afraid chapter vii the dreadful news of the battle of borodinó of our losses 
in killed and wounded and the still more terrible news of the loss of moscow 
reached vorónezh in the middle of september princess mary having learned of her wound only 
from the gazette and having no definite news of him prepared so nicholas heard he 
had not seen her again himself to set off in search of prince andrew when 
he received the news of the battle of borodinó and the abandonment of moscow rostóv 
was not seized with despair anger the desire for vengeance or any feeling of that 
kind but everything in vorónezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and he experienced 
an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the conversations he heard seemed to him insincere 
he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in 
the regiment would everything again become clear to him he made haste to finish buying 
the horses and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster a few 
days before his departure a special thanksgiving at which nicholas was present was held in 
the cathedral for the russian victory he stood a little behind the governor and held 
himself with military decorum through the service meditating on a great variety of subjects when 
the service was over the wife beckoned him to her you seen the princess she 
asked indicating with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side 
beyond the choir nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profile he 
saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude timidity and pity that immediately 
overcame him princess mary evidently engrossed by her thoughts was crossing herself for the last 
time before leaving the church nicholas looked at her face with surprise it was the 
same face he had seen before there was the same general expression of refined inner 
spiritual labor but now it was quite differently lit up there was a pathetic expression 
of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had occurred before when she was present 
nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the wife and not 
asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in 
church and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole 
soul as soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face 
lighting up both her sorrow and her joy is one thing i wanted to tell 
you princess said rostóv is that if your brother prince andrew nikoláevich were not living 
it would have been at once announced in the gazette as he is a colonel 
the princess looked at him not grasping what he was saying but cheered by the 
expression of regretful sympathy on his face i have known so many cases of a 
splinter the gazette said it was a shell proving fatal at once or being very 
slight continued nicholas must hope for the best and i am sure princess mary interrupted 
him that would be so dread she began and prevented by agitation from finishing she 
bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she did in his presence 
and looking up at him gratefully went out following her aunt that evening nicholas did 
not go out but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers 
when he had finished that business it was already too late to go anywhere but 
still too early to go to bed and for a long time he paced up 
and down the room reflecting on his life a thing he rarely did princess mary 
had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in smolénsk province 
his having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances and his mother having at one time 
mentioned her to him as a good match had drawn his particular attention to her 
when he met her again in vorónezh the impression she made on him was not 
merely pleasing but powerful nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed 
in her at this time he was however preparing to go away and it had 
not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of 
meeting her but that encounter in church had he felt sunk deeper than was desirable 
for his peace of mind that pale sad refined face that radiant look those gentle 
graceful gestures and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated 
him and evoked his sympathy in men rostóv could not bear to see the expression 
of a higher spiritual life that was why he did not like prince andrew and 
he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess but in princess mary that very 
sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an 
irresistible attraction must be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself am 
i not free why was i in such a hurry with sónya and he involuntarily 
compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it 
in the spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly he tried to picture 
what would happen were he free how he would propose to her and how she 
would become his wife but no he could not imagine that he felt awed and 
no clear picture presented itself to his mind he had long ago pictured to himself 
a future with sónya and that was all clear and simple just because it had 
all been thought out and he knew all there was in sónya but it was 
impossible to picture a future with princess mary because he did not understand her but 
simply loved her reveries about sónya had had something merry and playful in them but 
to dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frightening she prayed he 
thought was plain that her whole soul was in her prayer yes that was the 
prayer that moves mountains and i am sure her prayer will be answered why i 
pray for what i want he suddenly thought do i want to be free released 
from sónya she was right he thought remembering what the wife had said but misfortune 
can come of marrying sónya muddles grief for mamma business difficulties muddles terrible muddles besides 
i love as i should o god release me from this dreadful inextricable position he 
suddenly began to pray prayer can move mountains but one must have faith and not 
pray as natásha and i used to as children that the snow might turn into 
then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so no but 
i am not praying for trifles now he thought as he put his pipe down 
in a corner and folding his hands placed himself before the icon softened by memories 
of princess mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long 
time tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened and 
lavrúshka came in with some papers why do you come in without being called cried 
nicholas quickly changing his attitude the governor said lavrúshka in a sleepy voice courier has 
arrived and a letter for you all right thanks you can go nicholas took the 
two letters one of which was from his mother and the other from sónya he 
recognized them by the handwriting and opened first he had read only a few lines 
when he turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy not possible 
he cried aloud unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding 
the letter and reading it he glanced through it then read it again and then 
again and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders stretching 
out his hands with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed what he had 
just been praying for with confidence that god would hear him had come to pass 
but nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected and 
as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had 
not come from god to whom he had prayed but by some ordinary coincidence this 
unexpected and as it seemed to nicholas quite voluntary letter from sónya freed him from 
the knot that fettered him and from which there had seemed no escape she wrote 
that the last unfortunate loss of almost the whole of the moscow the repeatedly expressed 
wish that nicholas should marry princess bolkónskaya together with his silence and coldness of late 
had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set 
him completely free it would be too painful to me to think that i might 
be a cause of sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good 
to me she wrote and my love has no aim but the happiness of those 
i love so nicholas i beg you to consider yourself free and to be assured 
that in spite of everything no one can love you more than does your sónya 
both letters were written from tróitsa the other from the countess described their last days 
in moscow their departure the fire and the destruction of all their property in this 
letter the countess also mentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded traveling with them 
his state was very critical but the doctor said there was now more hope sónya 
and natásha were nursing him next day nicholas took his letter and went to see 
princess mary neither he nor she said a word about what nursing might mean but 
thanks to this letter nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if 
they were relations the following day he saw princess mary off on her journey to 
yaroslávl and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment chapter viii letter written 
from tróitsa which had come as an answer to prayer was prompted by this the 
thought of getting nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old mind more and more 
she knew that sónya was the chief obstacle to this happening and life in the 
house had grown harder and harder especially after they had received a letter from nicholas 
telling of his meeting with princess mary in boguchárovo the countess let no occasion slip 
of making humiliating or cruel allusions to sónya but a few days before they left 
moscow moved and excited by all that was going on she called sónya to her 
and instead of reproaching and making demands on her tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself 
and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement 
with nicholas shall not be at peace till you promise me this sónya burst into 
hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared 
for anything but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to 
do what was demanded of her she must sacrifice herself for the family that had 
reared and brought her up to sacrifice herself for others was habit her position in 
the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth and she 
was accustomed to this and loved doing it but in all her former acts of 
self sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem 
and in that of others and so made her more worthy of nicholas whom she 
loved more than anything in the world but now they wanted her to sacrifice the 
very thing that constituted the whole reward for her self sacrifice and the whole meaning 
of her life and for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had 
been her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully she felt jealous of natásha 
who had never experienced anything of this sort had never needed to sacrifice herself but 
made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody and for the 
first time sónya felt that out of her pure quiet love for nicholas a passionate 
feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle virtue or religion under 
the influence of this feeling sónya whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to 
be secretive having answered the countess in vague general terms avoided talking with her and 
resolved to wait till she should see nicholas not in order to set him free 
but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever the bustle 
and terror of the last days in moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed sónya 
she was glad to find escape from them in practical activity but when she heard 
of prince presence in their house despite her sincere pity for him and for natásha 
she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that god did not intend her 
to be separated from nicholas she knew that natásha loved no one but prince andrew 
and had never ceased to love him she knew that being thrown together again under 
such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with one another and that nicholas 
would then not be able to marry princess mary as they would be within the 
prohibited degrees of affinity despite all the terror of what had happened during those last 
days and during the first days of their journey this feeling that providence was intervening 
in her personal affairs cheered sónya at the tróitsa monastery the rostóvs first broke their 
journey for a whole day three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery 
hostelry one of which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded man was much better 
that day and natásha was sitting with him in the next room sat the count 
and countess respectfully conversing with the prior who was calling on them as old acquaintances 
and benefactors of the monastery sónya was there too tormented by curiosity as to what 
prince andrew and natásha were talking about she heard the sound of their voices through 
the door that door opened and natásha came out looking excited not noticing the monk 
who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the wide sleeve on his 
right arm she went up to sónya and took her hand what are you about 
come here said the countess natásha went up to the monk for his blessing and 
he advised her to pray for aid to god and his saint as soon as 
the prior withdrew natásha took her friend by the hand and went with her into 
the unoccupied room will he live she asked how happy i am and how unhappy 
sónya dovey everything is as it used to be if only he lives he cannot 
because because of and natásha burst into tears i knew it thank god murmured sónya 
will live sónya was not less agitated than her friend by the fear and grief 
and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one sobbing she kissed 
and comforted natásha only he lives she thought having wept talked and wiped away their 
tears the two friends went together to prince door natásha opened it cautiously and glanced 
into the room sónya standing beside her at the half open door prince andrew was 
lying raised high on three pillows his pale face was calm his eyes closed and 
they could see his regular breathing natásha sónya suddenly almost screamed catching her arm and 
stepping back from the door what is it asked natásha that that said sónya with 
a white face and trembling lips natásha softly closed the door and went with sónya 
to the window not yet understanding what the latter was telling her remember said sónya 
with a solemn and frightened expression remember when i looked in the mirror for you 
at otrádnoe at christmas do you remember what i saw yes cried natásha opening her 
eyes wide and vaguely recalling that sónya had told her something about prince andrew whom 
she had seen lying down remember sónya went on saw it then and told everybody 
you and dunyásha i saw him lying on a bed said she making a gesture 
with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail that he had his eyes 
closed and was covered just with a pink quilt and that his hands were folded 
she concluded convincing herself that the details she had just seen were exactly what she 
had seen in the mirror she had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned 
the first thing that came into her head but what she had invented then seemed 
to her now as real as any other recollection she not only remembered what she 
had then he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with something 
was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said that he was covered with 
a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed yes it really was pink cried 
natásha who now thought she too remembered the word pink being used and saw in 
this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction what does it mean she 
added meditatively i know it is all so strange replied sónya clutching at her head 
a few minutes later prince andrew rang and natásha went to him but sónya feeling 
unusually excited and touched remained at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had 
occurred they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and the 
countess was writing to her son said the countess raising her eyes from her letter 
as her niece passed you write to nicholas she spoke in a soft tremulous voice 
and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles sónya read all that the 
countess meant to convey with these words those eyes expressed entreaty shame at having to 
ask fear of a refusal and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal 
sónya went up to the countess and kneeling down kissed her hand mamma i will 
write said she sónya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred that 
day especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her vision now that 
she knew that the renewal of relations with prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying 
princess mary she was joyfully conscious of a return of that self sacrificing spirit in 
which she was accustomed to live and loved to live so with a joyful consciousness 
of performing a magnanimous several times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black wrote 
that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholas chapter ix the officer 
and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with hostility but yet with respect in 
the guardhouse to which he was taken in their attitude toward him could still be 
felt both uncertainty as to who he might a very important hostility as a result 
of their recent personal conflict with him but when the guard was relieved next morning 
pierre felt that for the new officers and was not as interesting as he had 
been to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day did not 
recognize in this big stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had 
fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words 
about saving a child they saw in him only no 17 of the captured russians 
arrested and detained for some reason by order of the higher command if they noticed 
anything remarkable about pierre it was only his unabashed meditative concentration and thoughtfulness and the 
way he spoke french which struck them as surprisingly good in spite of this he 
was placed that day with the other arrested suspects as the separate room he had 
occupied was required by an officer all the russians confined with pierre were men of 
the lowest class and recognizing him as a gentleman they all avoided him more especially 
as he spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him that 
evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably among them were to be tried 
for incendiarism on the third day he was taken with the others to a house 
where a french general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other frenchmen 
with scarves on their arms with the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners and 
which is supposed to preclude human frailty pierre like the others was questioned as to 
who he was where he had been with what object and so on these questions 
like questions put at trials generally left the essence of the matter aside shut out 
the possibility of that being revealed and were designed only to form a channel through 
which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead 
to the desired result namely a conviction as soon as pierre began to say anything 
that did not fit in with that aim the channel was removed and the water 
could flow to waste pierre felt moreover what the accused always feel at their trial 
perplexity as to why these questions were put to him he had a feeling that 
it was only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of 
placing a channel was employed he knew he was in these power that only by 
force had they brought him there that force alone gave them the right to demand 
answers to their questions and that the sole object of that assembly was to inculpate 
him and so as they had the power and wish to inculpate him this expedient 
of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary it was evident that any answer would lead 
to conviction when asked what he was doing when he was arrested pierre replied in 
a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a child he had 
saved from the flames why had he fought the marauder pierre answered that he protecting 
a woman and that protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of 
every man that they interrupted him for this was not to the point why was 
he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had seen him he replied 
that he had gone out to see what was happening in moscow again they interrupted 
him they had not asked where he was going but why he was found near 
the fire who was he they asked repeating their first question which he had declined 
to answer again he replied that he could not answer it that down bad very 
bad sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face on the 
fourth day fires broke out on the zúbovski rampart pierre and thirteen others were moved 
to the coach house of a house near the crimean bridge on his way through 
the streets pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole 
city fires were visible on all sides he did not then realize the significance of 
the burning of moscow and looked at the fires with horror he passed four days 
in the coach house near the crimean bridge and during that time learned from the 
talk of the french soldiers that all those confined there were awaiting a decision which 
might come any day from the marshal what marshal this was pierre could not learn 
from the soldiers evidently for them represented a very high and rather mysterious power these 
first days before the eighth of september when the prisoners were had up for a 
second examination were the hardest of all for pierre chapter x on the eighth of 
september an very important one judging by the respect the guards showed the coach house 
where the prisoners were this officer probably someone on the staff was holding a paper 
in his hand and called over all the russians there naming pierre as man who 
does not give his name glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners he ordered 
the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them 
to the marshal an hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre with thirteen 
others was led to the field it was a fine day sunny after rain and 
the air was unusually pure the smoke did not hang low as on the day 
when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the zúbovski rampart but rose through 
the pure air in columns no flames were seen but columns of smoke rose on 
all sides and all moscow as far as pierre could see was one vast charred 
ruin on all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still 
standing and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses pierre gazed at 
the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well here and there he 
could see churches that had not been burned the krémlin which was not destroyed gleamed 
white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of iván the great the 
domes of the new convent of the virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing 
particularly clearly these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the 
nativity of the virgin but there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday 
everywhere were blackened ruins and the few russians to be seen were tattered and frightened 
people who tried to hide when they saw the french it was plain that the 
russian nest was ruined and destroyed but in place of the russian order of life 
that had been destroyed pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different firm french order had 
been established over this ruined nest he felt this in the looks of the soldiers 
who marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily were escorting him and the other criminals 
he felt it in the looks of an important french official in a carriage and 
pair driven by a soldier whom they met on the way he felt it in 
the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field 
and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the french officer had 
read out when he came that morning pierre had been taken by one set of 
soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other 
men and it seemed that they might have forgotten him or confused him with the 
others but no the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him 
in his designation as man who does not give his name and under that appellation 
which to pierre seemed terrible they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on 
their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted 
and that they were being taken to the proper place pierre felt himself to be 
an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not 
understand but which was working well he and the other prisoners were taken to the 
right side of the field to a large white house with an immense garden not 
far from the convent this was prince house where pierre had often been in other 
days and which as he learned from the talk of the soldiers was now occupied 
by the marshal the duke of eckmühl davout they were taken to the entrance and 
led into the house one by one pierre was the sixth to enter he was 
conducted through a glass gallery an anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him 
into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant davout spectacles 
on nose sat bent over a table at the further end of the room pierre 
went close up to him but davout evidently consulting a paper that lay before him 
did not look up without raising his eyes he said in a low voice are 
you pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to him davout 
was not merely a french general but a man notorious for his cruelty looking at 
his cold face as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait 
awhile for an answer pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his 
life but he did not know what to say he did not venture to repeat 
what he had said at his first examination yet to disclose his rank and position 
was dangerous and embarrassing so he was silent but before he had decided what to 
do davout raised his head pushed his spectacles back on his forehead screwed up his 
eyes and looked intently at him know that man he said in a cold measured 
tone evidently calculated to frighten pierre the chill that had been running down back now 
seized his head as in a vise cannot know me general i have never seen 
you is a russian spy davout interrupted addressing another general who was present but whom 
pierre had not noticed davout turned away with an unexpected reverberation in his voice pierre 
rapidly began monseigneur he said suddenly remembering that davout was a duke monseigneur you cannot 
have known me i am a militia officer and have not quitted moscow name asked 
davout proof have i that you are not lying exclaimed pierre not in an offended 
but in a pleading voice davout looked up and gazed intently at him for some 
seconds they looked at one another and that look saved pierre apart from conditions of 
war and law that look established human relations between the two men at that moment 
an immense number of things passed dimly through both their minds and they realized that 
they were both children of humanity and were brothers at the first glance when davout 
had only raised his head from the papers where human affairs and lives were indicated 
by numbers pierre was merely a circumstance and davout could have shot him without burdening 
his conscience with an evil deed but now he saw in him a human being 
he reflected for a moment can you show me that you are telling the truth 
said davout coldly pierre remembered ramballe and named him and his regiment and the street 
where the house was are not what you say returned davout in a trembling faltering 
voice pierre began adducing proofs of the truth of his statements but at that moment 
an adjutant entered and reported something to davout davout brightened up at the news the 
adjutant brought and began buttoning up his uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten 
pierre when the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner he jerked his head in direction 
with a frown and ordered him to be led away but where they were to 
take him pierre did not know back to the coach house or to the place 
of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed the field he 
turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question to davout of 
course replied davout but what this meant pierre did not know pierre could not afterwards 
remember how he went whether it was far or in which direction his faculties were 
quite numbed he was stupefied and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs 
as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too the only thought 
in his mind at that time was who was it that had really sentenced him 
to death not the men on the commission that had first examined one of them 
wished to or evidently could have done it it was not davout who had looked 
at him in so human a way in another moment davout would have realized that 
he was doing wrong but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him 
the adjutant also had evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from 
coming in then who was executing him killing him depriving him of pierre with all 
his memories aspirations hopes and thoughts who was doing this and pierre felt that it 
was no one it was a concurrence of circumstances a system of some sort was 
killing him of life of everything annihilating him chapter xi from prince house the prisoners 
were led straight down the field to the left of the nunnery as far as 
a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up beyond that post a 
fresh pit had been dug in the ground and near the post and the pit 
a large crowd stood in a semicircle the crowd consisted of a few russians and 
many of soldiers who were not on italians and frenchmen in a variety of uniforms 
to the right and left of the post stood rows of french troops in blue 
uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos the prisoners were placed in a 
certain order according to the list pierre was sixth and were led to the post 
several drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them and at that sound 
pierre felt as if part of his soul had been torn away he lost the 
power of thinking or understanding he could only hear and see and he had only 
one the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly pierre looked round at 
his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them the two first were convicts with shaven heads one 
was tall and thin the other dark shaggy and sinewy with a flat nose the 
third was a domestic serf about forty five years old with grizzled hair and a 
plump well nourished body the fourth was a peasant a very handsome man with a 
broad light brown beard and black eyes the fifth was a factory hand a thin 
sallow faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat pierre heard the french consulting whether 
to shoot them separately or two at a time couples replied the officer in command 
in a calm voice there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and 
it was evident that they were all as men hurry to do something they understand 
but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task a french 
official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of prisoners and 
read out the sentence in russian and in french then two pairs of frenchmen approached 
the criminals and at the command took the two convicts who stood first in the 
row the convicts stopped when they reached the post and while sacks were being brought 
looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching huntsman one crossed himself 
continually the other scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a 
smile with hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them drawing the sacks over their heads and 
bound them to the post twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with 
a firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post pierre turned away to 
avoid seeing what was going to happen suddenly a crackling rolling noise was heard which 
seemed to him louder than the most terrific thunder and he looked round there was 
some smoke and the frenchmen were doing something near the pit with pale faces and 
trembling hands two more prisoners were led up in the same way and with similar 
looks these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection 
in their eyes evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to happen to 
them they could not believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to 
them and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken from them 
again pierre did not wish to look and again turned away but again the sound 
as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the same moment he saw 
smoke blood and the pale scared faces of the frenchmen who were again doing something 
by the post their trembling hands impeding one another pierre breathing heavily looked around as 
if asking what it meant the same question was expressed in all the looks that 
met his on the faces of all the russians and of the french soldiers and 
officers without exception he read the same dismay horror and conflict that were in his 
own heart who after all is doing this they are all suffering as i am 
who then is it who flashed for an instant through his mind of the 86th 
forward shouted someone the fifth prisoner the one next to pierre was led pierre did 
not understand that he was saved that he and the rest had been brought there 
only to witness the execution with ever growing horror and no sense of joy or 
relief he gazed at what was taking place the fifth man was the factory lad 
in the loose cloak the moment they laid hands on him he sprang aside in 
terror and clutched at pierre pierre shuddered and shook himself free the lad was unable 
to walk they dragged him along holding him up under the arms and he screamed 
when they got him to the post he grew quiet as if he suddenly understood 
something whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible that 
men should kill him at any rate he took his stand at the post waiting 
to be blindfolded like the others and like a wounded animal looked around him with 
glittering eyes pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his 
curiosity and agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the highest pitch at this 
fifth murder like the others this fifth man seemed calm he wrapped his loose cloak 
closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other when they began to blindfold him 
he himself adjusted the knot which hurt the back of his head then when they 
propped him against the bloodstained post he leaned back and not being comfortable in that 
position straightened himself adjusted his feet and leaned back again more comfortably pierre did not 
take his eyes from him and did not miss his slightest movement probably a word 
of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets but try 
as he would pierre could not afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the 
shots he only saw how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held 
him how blood showed itself in two places how the ropes slackened under the weight 
of the hanging body and how the workman sat down his head hanging unnaturally and 
one leg bent under him pierre ran up to the post no one hindered him 
pale frightened people were doing something around the workman the lower jaw of an old 
frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes the body collapsed the 
soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the pit they 
all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must hide the traces of 
their guilt as quickly as possible pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the 
factory lad was lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder 
higher than the other that shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively but spadefuls of 
earth were already being thrown over the whole body one of the soldiers evidently suffering 
shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre to go back but pierre did not understand him 
and remained near the post and no one drove him away when the pit had 
been filled up a command was given pierre was taken back to his place and 
the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a half turn and 
went past it at a measured pace the twenty four sharpshooters with discharged muskets standing 
in the center of the circle ran back to their places as the companies passed 
by pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in couples out 
of the circle all but one rejoined their companies this one a young soldier his 
face deadly pale his shako pushed back and his musket resting on the ground still 
stood near the pit at the spot from which he had fired he swayed like 
a drunken man taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling an 
old noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged 
him to his company the crowd of russians and frenchmen began to disperse they all 
went away silently and with drooping heads will teach them to start fires said one 
of the frenchmen pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a 
soldier who was trying to find some relief after what had been done but was 
not able to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he made 
a hopeless movement with his arm and went away chapter xii after the execution pierre 
was separated from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone in a small ruined 
and befouled church toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and told him 
that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for the prisoners 
of war without understanding what was said to him pierre got up and went with 
the soldiers they took him to the upper end of the field where there were 
some sheds built of charred planks beams and battens and led him into one of 
them in the darkness some twenty different men surrounded pierre he looked at them without 
understanding who they were why they were there or what they wanted of him he 
heard what they said but did not understand the meaning of the words and made 
no kind of deduction from or application of them he replied to questions they put 
to him but did not consider who was listening to his replies nor how they 
would understand them he looked at their faces and figures but they all seemed to 
him equally meaningless from the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by men 
who did not wish to commit them it was as if the mainspring of his 
life on which everything depended and which made everything appear alive had suddenly been wrenched 
out and everything had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not 
acknowledge it to himself his faith in the right ordering of the universe in humanity 
in his own soul and in god had been destroyed he had experienced this before 
but never so strongly as now when similar doubts had assailed him before they had 
been the result of his own wrongdoing and at the bottom of his heart he 
had felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be found 
within himself but now he felt that the universe had crumbled before his eyes and 
only meaningless ruins remained and this not by any fault of his own he felt 
that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life 
around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something about him interested them 
greatly they were telling him something and asking him something then they led him away 
somewhere and at last he found himself in a corner of the shed among men 
who were laughing and talking on all sides then mates that very prince who some 
voice at the other end of the shed was saying with a strong emphasis on 
the word who sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall 
pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes but as soon as he closed them 
he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory dreadful because of its the 
faces of the murderers even more dreadful because of their disquiet and he opened his 
eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him beside him in a stooping 
position sat a small man of whose presence he was first made aware by a 
strong smell of perspiration which came from him every time he moved this man was 
doing something to his legs in the darkness and though pierre could not see his 
face he felt that the man continually glanced at him on growing used to the 
darkness pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg bands and the way 
he did it aroused interest having unwound the string that tied the band on one 
leg he carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg 
glancing up at pierre while one hand hung up the first string the other was 
already unwinding the band on the second leg in this way having carefully removed the 
leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one another uninterruptedly the man 
hung the leg bands up on some pegs fixed above his head then he took 
out a knife cut something closed the knife placed it under the head of his 
bed and seating himself comfortably clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his 
eyes on pierre the latter was conscious of something pleasant comforting and well rounded in 
these deft movements in the well ordered arrangements in his corner and even in his 
very smell and he looked at the man without taking his eyes from him seen 
a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly said and there was so 
much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice that pierre tried to reply but his 
jaw trembled and he felt tears rising to his eyes the little fellow giving pierre 
no time to betray his confusion instantly continued in the same pleasant tones lad fret 
said he in the tender singsong caressing voice old russian peasant women employ fret an 
hour live for an age how it is my dear fellow and here we live 
thank heaven without offense among these folk too there are good men as well as 
bad said he and still speaking he turned on his knees with a supple movement 
got up coughed and went off to another part of the shed you rascal pierre 
heard the same kind voice saying at the other end of the shed come you 
rascal she remembers now now do and the soldier pushing away a little dog that 
was jumping up at him returned to his place and sat down in his hands 
he had something wrapped in a rag eat a bit sir said he resuming his 
former respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes had soup for 
dinner and the potatoes are grand pierre had not eaten all day and the smell 
of the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him he thanked the soldier and began to 
eat are they all right said the soldier with a smile should do like this 
he took a potato drew out his clasp knife cut the potato into two equal 
halves on the palm of his hand sprinkled some salt on it from the rag 
and handed it to pierre potatoes are grand he said once more some like that 
pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better all right said he why 
did they shoot those poor fellows the last one was hardly twenty tt said the 
little man what a sin what a sin he added quickly and as if his 
words were always waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on 
was it sir that you stayed in moscow think they would come so soon i 
stayed accidentally replied pierre how did they arrest you dear lad at your house i 
went to look at the fire and they arrested me there and tried me as 
an incendiary law injustice put in the little man have you been here long pierre 
asked as he munched the last of the potato it was last sunday they took 
me out of a hospital in moscow are you a soldier then we are soldiers 
of the ápsheron regiment i was dying of fever we told anything there were some 
twenty of us lying there we had no idea never guessed at all do you 
feel sad here pierre inquired can one help it lad my name is platón and 
the surname is karatáev he added evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre to 
address him call me in the regiment how is one to help feeling sad the 
mother of cities how can one see all this and not feel sad but maggot 
gnaws the cabbage yet dies what the old folks used to tell us he added 
rapidly what did you say asked pierre i said karatáev say things happen not as 
we plan but as god judges he replied thinking that he was repeating what he 
had said before and immediately continued and you have you a family estate sir and 
a house so you have abundance then and a housewife and your old parents are 
they still living he asked and though it was too dark for pierre to see 
he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the lips as he put these 
questions he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents especially that he had no mother 
wife for counsel a mother in law for welcome but none as dear as own 
mother said he and have you little ones he went on asking again negative answer 
seemed to distress him and he hastened to add mind young folks yet and please 
god may still have some the great thing is to live in harmony all the 
same now pierre could not help saying my dear fellow rejoined karatáev decline a prison 
or a sack he seated himself more comfortably and coughed evidently preparing to tell a 
long story my dear fellow i was still living at home he began had a 
well to do homestead plenty of land we peasants lived well and our house was 
one to thank god for when father and we went out mowing there were seven 
of us we lived well we were real peasants it so happened and platón karatáev 
told a long story of how he had gone into copse to take wood how 
he had been caught by the keeper had been tried flogged and sent to serve 
as a soldier lad and a smile changed the tone of his voice thought it 
was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing if it had not been for 
my sin my brother would have had to go as a soldier but he my 
younger brother had five little ones while i you see only left a wife behind 
we had a little girl but god took her before i went as a soldier 
i come home on leave and tell you how it was i look and see 
that they are living better than before the yard full of cattle the women at 
home two brothers away earning wages and only michael the youngest at home father he 
says my children are the same to me it hurts the same whichever finger gets 
bitten but if platón been shaved for a soldier michael would have had to go 
called us all to him and will you believe it placed us in front of 
the icons he says here and bow down to his feet and you young woman 
you bow down too and you grandchildren also bow down before him do you understand 
he says how it is dear fellow fate looks for a head but we are 
always judging not not right our luck is like water in a dragnet you pull 
at it and it bulges but when drawn it out empty how it is and 
platón shifted his seat on the straw after a short silence he rose i think 
you must be sleepy said he and began rapidly crossing himself and repeating jesus christ 
holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesus christ holy saint nicholas frola and lavra 
lord jesus christ have mercy on us and save us he concluded then bowed to 
the ground got up sighed and sat down again on his heap of straw the 
way lay me down like a stone o god and raise me up like a 
loaf he muttered as he lay down pulling his coat over him prayer was that 
you were saying asked pierre murmured platón who had almost fallen asleep was i saying 
i was praying you pray i do said pierre what was that you said frola 
and lavra of course replied platón quickly saints one must pity the animals too eh 
the rascal now curled up and got warm you daughter of a bitch said karatáev 
touching the dog that lay at his feet and again turning over he fell asleep 
immediately sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance outside and flames 
were visible through the cracks of the shed but inside it was quiet and dark 
for a long time pierre did not sleep but lay with eyes open in the 
darkness listening to the regular snoring of platón who lay beside him and he felt 
that the world that had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with 
a new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations chapter xiii twenty three soldiers three 
officers and two officials were confined in the shed in which pierre had been placed 
and where he remained for four weeks when pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed 
misty figures to him except platón karatáev who always remained in his mind a most 
vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything russian kindly and round when pierre 
saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the first impression of him as of something 
round was fully confirmed whole a french overcoat girdled with a cord a cap and 
bast round his head was quite round his back chest shoulders and even his arms 
which he held as if ever ready to embrace something were rounded his pleasant smile 
and his large gentle brown eyes were also round platón karatáev must have been fifty 
judging by his stories of campaigns he had been in told as by an old 
soldier he did not himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it 
but his brilliantly white strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he he 
often all sound and good there was not a gray hair in his beard or 
on his head and his whole body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of 
firmness and endurance his face despite its fine rounded wrinkles had an expression of innocence 
and youth his voice was pleasant and musical but the chief peculiarity of his speech 
was its directness and appositeness it was evident that he never considered what he had 
said or was going to say and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation 
had an irresistible persuasiveness his physical strength and agility during the first days of his 
imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and sickness meant every 
night before lying down he said lay me down as a stone and raise me 
up as a loaf and every morning on getting up he said lay down and 
curled up i get up and shake myself and indeed he only had to lie 
down to fall asleep like a stone and he only had to shake himself to 
be ready without a delay for some work just as children are ready to play 
directly they awake he could do everything not very well but not badly he baked 
cooked sewed planed and mended boots he was always busy and only at night allowed 
himself which he was songs he did not sing like a trained singer who knows 
he is listened to but like the birds evidently giving vent to the sounds in 
the same way that one stretches oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness 
and the sounds were always high pitched mournful delicate and almost feminine and his face 
at such times was very serious having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to 
grow he seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon military and 
alien to had returned to his former peasant habits soldier on shirt outside breeches he 
would say he did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he 
did not complain and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the 
whole of his army service when he related anything it was generally some old and 
evidently precious memory of his life as he called his peasant existence the proverbs of 
which his talk was full were for the most part not the coarse and indecent 
saws soldiers employ but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant 
but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom he would often say 
the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous occasion yet both would 
be right he liked to talk and he talked well adorning his speech with terms 
of endearment and with folk sayings which pierre thought he invented himself but the chief 
charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest just such as pierre 
had witnessed without taking notice of in a character of solemn fitness he liked to 
hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening they 
were always the same but most of all he liked to hear stories of real 
life he would smile joyfully when listening to such stories now and then putting in 
a word or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was 
told clear to himself karatáev had no attachments friendships or love as pierre understood them 
but loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in contact with particularly with 
any particular man but those with whom he happened to be he loved his dog 
his comrades the french and pierre who was his neighbor but pierre felt that in 
spite of affectionate tenderness for him by which he unconsciously gave spiritual life its due 
he would not have grieved for a moment at parting from him and pierre began 
to feel in the same way toward karatáev to all the other prisoners platón karatáev 
seemed a most ordinary soldier they called him or chaffed him good naturedly and sent 
him on errands but to pierre he always remained what he had seemed that first 
night an unfathomable rounded eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth platón karatáev 
knew nothing by heart except his prayers when he began to speak he seemed not 
to know how he would conclude sometimes pierre struck by the meaning of his words 
would ask him to repeat them but platón could never recall what he had said 
a moment before just as he never could repeat to pierre the words of his 
favorite song native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in it but 
when spoken and not sung no meaning could be got out of it he did 
not and could not understand the meaning of words apart from their context every word 
and action of his was the manifestation of an activity unknown to him which was 
his life but his life as he regarded it had no meaning as a separate 
thing it had meaning only as part of a whole of which he was always 
conscious his words and actions flowed from him as evenly inevitably and spontaneously as fragrance 
exhales from a flower he could not understand the value or significance of any word 
or deed taken separately chapter xiv when princess mary heard from nicholas that her brother 
was with the rostóvs at yaroslávl she at once prepared to go there in spite 
of her efforts to dissuade not merely to go herself but to take her nephew 
with her whether it were difficult or easy possible or impossible she did not ask 
and did not want to know it was her duty not only to herself to 
be near her brother who was perhaps dying but to do everything possible to take 
his son to him and so she prepared to set off that she had not 
heard from prince andrew himself princess mary attributed to his being too weak to write 
or to his considering the long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and 
his son in a few days princess mary was ready to start her equipages were 
the huge family coach in which she had traveled to vorónezh a semiopen trap and 
a baggage cart with her traveled mademoiselle bourienne little nicholas and his tutor her old 
nurse three maids tíkhon and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to 
accompany her the usual route through moscow could not be thought of and the roundabout 
way princess mary was obliged to take through lípetsk ryazán vladímir and shúya was very 
long and as post horses were not everywhere obtainable very difficult and near ryazán where 
the french were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous during this difficult journey 
mademoiselle bourienne dessalles and princess servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of spirit 
she went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them and no difficulties 
daunted her thanks to her activity and energy which infected her fellow travelers they approached 
yaroslávl by the end of the second week the last days of her stay in 
vorónezh had been the happiest of her life her love for rostóv no longer tormented 
or agitated her it filled her whole soul had become an integral part of herself 
and she no longer struggled against it latterly she had become convinced that she loved 
and was beloved though she never said this definitely to herself in words she had 
become convinced of it at her last interview with nicholas when he had come to 
tell her that her brother was with the rostóvs not by a single word had 
nicholas alluded to the fact that prince relations with natásha might if he recovered be 
renewed but princess mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of this 
yet in spite of that his relation to delicate and only remained unchanged but it 
sometimes seemed to princess mary that he was even glad that the family connection between 
them allowed him to express his friendship more freely she knew that she loved for 
the first and only time in her life and felt that she was beloved and 
was happy in regard to it but this happiness on one side of her spiritual 
nature did not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force on the 
contrary that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her 
to give full play to her feeling for her brother that feeling was so strong 
at the moment of leaving vorónezh that those who saw her off as they looked 
at her careworn despairing face felt sure she would fall ill on the journey but 
the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey which she took so actively in hand 
saved her for a while from her grief and gave her strength as always happens 
when traveling princess mary thought only of the journey itself forgetting its object but as 
she approached yaroslávl the thought of what might await her after many days but that 
very presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its utmost limit the courier 
who had been sent on in advance to find out where the rostóvs were staying 
in yaroslávl and in what condition prince andrew was when he met the big coach 
just entering the town gates was appalled by the terrible pallor of the face that 
looked out at him from the window have found out everything your excellency the rostóvs 
are staying at the merchant house in the square not far from here right above 
the vólga said the courier princess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry not understanding 
why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know how was her 
brother mademoiselle bourienne put that question for her is the prince she asked excellency is 
staying in the same house with them he is alive thought princess mary and asked 
in a low voice is he servants say he is still the same what the 
might mean princess mary did not ask but with an unnoticed glance at little seven 
year old nicholas who was sitting in front of her looking with pleasure at the 
town she bowed her head and did not raise it again till the heavy coach 
rumbling shaking and swaying came to a stop the carriage steps clattered as they were 
let down the carriage door was opened on the left there was great on the 
right a porch there were people at the entrance servants and a rosy girl with 
a large plait of black hair smiling as it seemed to princess mary in an 
unpleasantly affected way this was sónya princess mary ran up the steps way this way 
said the girl with the same artificial smile and the princess found herself in the 
hall facing an elderly woman of oriental type who came rapidly to meet her with 
a look of emotion this was the countess she embraced princess mary and kissed her 
enfant she muttered vous aime et vous connais depuis longtemps child i love you and 
have known you a long time despite her excitement princess mary realized that this was 
the countess and that it was necessary to say something to her hardly knowing how 
she did it she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in french in the 
same tone as those that had been addressed to her and asked is he doctor 
says that he is not in danger said the countess but as she spoke she 
raised her eyes with a sigh and her gesture conveyed a contradiction of her words 
is he can i see i asked the princess moment princess one moment my dear 
is this his son said the countess turning to little nicholas who was coming in 
with dessalles will be room for everybody this is a big house oh what a 
lovely boy the countess took princess mary into the drawing room where sónya was talking 
to mademoiselle bourienne the countess caressed the boy and the old count came in and 
welcomed the princess he had changed very much since princess mary had last seen him 
then he had been a brisk cheerful self assured old man now he seemed a 
pitiful bewildered person while talking to princess mary he continually looked round as if asking 
everyone whether he was doing the right thing after the destruction of moscow and of 
his property thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense 
of his own significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for 
him in life in spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon 
as possible and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to 
see him they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew 
the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the necessity of 
submitting for a time to this new order of things which she had entered she 
knew it to be necessary and though it was hard for her she was not 
vexed with these people is my niece said the count introducing know her princess princess 
mary turned to sónya and trying to stifle the hostile feeling that arose in her 
toward the girl she kissed her but she felt oppressed by the fact that the 
mood of everyone around her was so far from what was in her own heart 
is he she asked again addressing them all is downstairs natásha is with him answered 
sónya flushing have sent to ask i think you must be tired princess tears of 
vexation showed themselves in princess eyes she turned away and was about to ask the 
countess again how to go to him when light impetuous and seemingly buoyant steps were 
heard at the door the princess looked round and saw natásha coming in almost natásha 
whom she had liked so little at their meeting in moscow long since but hardly 
had the princess looked at face before she realized that here was a real comrade 
in her grief and consequently a friend she ran to meet her embraced her and 
began to cry on her shoulder as soon as natásha sitting at the head of 
prince bed heard of princess arrival she softly left his room and hastened to her 
with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to princess mary there was only one 
expression on her agitated face when she ran into the drawing of love for him 
for her and for all that was near to the man she loved and of 
pity suffering for others and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them it 
was plain that at that moment there was in heart no thought of herself or 
of her own relations with prince andrew princess mary with her acute sensibility understood all 
this at the first glance at face and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful pleasure 
come to him mary said natásha leading her into the other room princess mary raised 
her head dried her eyes and turned to natásha she felt that from her she 
would be able to understand and learn everything she began her question but stopped short 
she felt that it was impossible to ask or to answer in words face and 
eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and profoundly natásha was gazing at 
her but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say all she knew or not 
she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths 
of her heart it was impossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw 
and suddenly lips twitched ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth and covering her face with 
her hands she burst into sobs princess mary understood but she still hoped and asked 
in words she herself did not trust how is his wound what is his general 
condition you will see was all natásha could say they sat a little while downstairs 
near his room till they had left off crying and were able to go to 
him with calm faces has his whole illness gone is it long since he grew 
worse when did this happen princess mary inquired natásha told her that at first there 
had been danger from his feverish condition and the pain he suffered but at tróitsa 
that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene that danger had 
also passed when they reached yaroslávl the wound had begun to fester natásha knew all 
about such things as festering and the doctor had said that the festering might take 
a normal course then fever set in but the doctor had said the fever was 
not very serious two days ago this suddenly happened said natásha struggling with her sobs 
know why but you will see what he is like he weaker thinner asked the 
princess not that but worse you will see o mary he is too good he 
cannot cannot live because chapter xv when natásha opened prince door with a familiar movement 
and let princess mary pass into the room before her the princess felt the sobs 
in her throat hard as she had tried to prepare herself and now tried to 
remain tranquil she knew that she would be unable to look at him without tears 
the princess understood what natásha had meant by the words days ago this suddenly happened 
she understood those words to mean that he had suddenly softened and that this softening 
and gentleness were signs of approaching death as she stepped to the door she already 
saw in imagination face as she remembered it in childhood a gentle mild sympathetic face 
which he had rarely shown and which therefore affected her very strongly she was sure 
he would speak soft tender words to her such as her father had uttered before 
his death and that she would not be able to bear it and would burst 
into sobs in his presence yet sooner or later it had to be and she 
went in the sobs rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and 
more clearly distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features 
and then she saw his face and met his gaze he was lying in a 
squirrel fur dressing gown on a divan surrounded by pillows he was thin and pale 
in one thin translucently white hand he held a handkerchief while with the other he 
stroked the delicate mustache he had grown moving his fingers slowly his eyes gazed at 
them as they entered on seeing his face and meeting his eyes princess pace suddenly 
slackened she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased she suddenly felt guilty 
and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and eyes in what am 
i to blame she asked herself and his cold stern look replied you are alive 
and thinking of the living while i in the deep gaze that seemed to look 
not outwards but inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his 
sister and natásha he kissed his sister holding her hand in his as was their 
wont are you mary how did you manage to get here said he in a 
voice as calm and aloof as his look had he screamed in agony that scream 
would not have struck such horror into princess heart as the tone of his voice 
have you brought little nicholas he asked in the same slow quiet manner and with 
an obvious effort to remember are you now said princess mary herself surprised at what 
she was saying my dear you must ask the doctor he replied and again making 
an evident effort to be affectionate he said with his lips only his words clearly 
did not correspond to his thoughts chère amie venue you for coming my dear princess 
mary pressed his hand the pressure made him wince just perceptibly he was silent and 
she did not know what to say she now understood what had happened to him 
two days before in his words his tone and especially in that calm almost antagonistic 
look could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world terrible in one 
who is alive evidently only with an effort did he understand anything living but it 
was obvious that he failed to understand not because he lacked the power to do 
so but because he understood something the living did not and could not which wholly 
occupied his mind you see how strangely fate has brought us together said he breaking 
the silence and pointing to natásha looks after me all the time princess mary heard 
him and did not understand how he could say such a thing he the sensitive 
tender prince andrew how could he say that before her whom he loved and who 
loved him had he expected to live he could not have said those words in 
that offensively cold tone if he had not known that he was dying how could 
he have failed to pity her and how could he speak like that in her 
presence the only explanation was that he was indifferent because something else much more important 
had been revealed to him the conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off 
came by way of ryazán said natásha prince andrew did not notice that she called 
his sister mary and only after calling her so in his presence did natásha notice 
it herself he asked told her that all moscow has been burned down and that 
natásha stopped it was impossible to talk it was plain that he was making an 
effort to listen but could not do so they say burned he said a great 
pity and he gazed straight before him absently stroking his mustache with his fingers so 
you have met count nicholas mary prince andrew suddenly said evidently wishing to speak pleasantly 
to them wrote here that he took a great liking to you he went on 
simply and calmly evidently unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for 
living people you liked him too it would be a good thing for you to 
get married he added rather more quickly as if pleased at having found words he 
had long been seeking princess mary heard his words but they had no meaning for 
her except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living 
talk of me she said quietly and glanced at natásha natásha who felt her glance 
did not look at her all three were again silent would you like princess mary 
suddenly said in a trembling voice you like to see little nicholas he is always 
talking about you prince andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time but princess 
mary who knew his face so well saw with horror that he did not smile 
with pleasure or affection for his son but with quiet gentle irony because he thought 
she was trying what she believed to be the last means of arousing him i 
shall be very glad to see him is he quite well when little nicholas was 
brought into prince room he looked at his father with frightened eyes but did not 
cry because no one else was crying prince andrew kissed him and evidently did not 
know what to say to him when nicholas had been led away princess mary again 
went up to her brother kissed him and unable to restrain her tears any longer 
began to cry he looked at her attentively it about nicholas he asked princess mary 
nodded her head weeping you know the gosp but he broke off did you say 
you cry here he said looking at her with the same cold expression when princess 
mary began to cry he understood that she was crying at the thought that little 
nicholas would be left without a father with a great effort he tried to return 
to life and to see things from their point of view to them it must 
seem sad he thought how simple it is fowls of the air sow not neither 
do they reap yet your father feedeth them he said to himself and wished to 
say to princess mary no they will take it their own way they understand they 
understand that all those feelings they prize our feelings all those ideas that seem so 
important to us are unnecessary we cannot understand one another and he remained silent prince 
little son was seven he could scarcely read and knew nothing after that day he 
lived through many things gaining knowledge observation and experience but had he possessed all the 
faculties he afterwards acquired he could not have had a better or more profound understanding 
of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his father mary and natásha 
than he had then he understood it completely and leaving the room without crying went 
silently up to natásha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her 
with his beautiful thoughtful eyes then his uplifted rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his 
head against her he began to cry after that he avoided dessalles and the countess 
who caressed him and either sat alone or came timidly to princess mary or to 
natásha of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt and clung to them 
quietly and shyly when princess mary had left prince andrew she fully understood what face 
had told her she did not speak any more to natásha of hopes of saving 
his life she took turns with her beside his sofa and did not cry any 
more but prayed continually turning in soul to that eternal and unfathomable whose presence above 
the dying man was now so evident chapter xvi not only did prince andrew know 
he would die but he felt that he was dying and was already half dead 
he was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness 
of existence without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming that inexorable eternal distant 
and unknown the presence of which he had felt continually all his now near to 
him and by the strange lightness he experienced almost comprehensible and palpable formerly he had 
feared the end he had twice experienced that terribly tormenting fear of now he no 
longer understood that fear he had felt it for the first time when the shell 
spun like a top before him and he looked at the fallow field the bushes 
and the sky and knew that he was face to face with death when he 
came to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal unfettered love had instantly 
unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that had 
restrained it he no longer feared death and ceased to think about it during the 
hours of solitude suffering and partial delirium he spent after he was wounded the more 
deeply he penetrated into the new principle of eternal love revealed to him the more 
he unconsciously detached himself from earthly life to love everything and everybody and always to 
sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone not to live this earthly life 
and the more imbued he became with that principle of love the more he renounced 
life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier the absence of such between 
life and death when during those first days he remembered that he would have to 
die he said to himself what of it so much the better but after the 
night in mytíshchi when half delirious he had seen her for whom he longed appear 
before him and having pressed her hand to his lips had shed gentle happy tears 
love for a particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound 
him to life and joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind recalling the 
moment at the ambulance station when he had seen kurágin he could not now regain 
the feeling he then had but was tormented by the question whether kurágin was alive 
and he dared not inquire his illness pursued its normal physical course but what natásha 
referred to when she said suddenly happened had occurred two days before princess mary arrived 
it was the last spiritual struggle between life and death in which death gained the 
victory it was the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as 
presented to him in the form of his love for natásha and a last though 
ultimately vanquished attack of terror before the unknown it was evening as usual after dinner 
he was slightly feverish and his thoughts were preternaturally clear sónya was sitting by the 
table he began to doze suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him she has come 
thought he and so it was in place sat natásha who had just come in 
noiselessly since she had begun looking after him he had always experienced this physical consciousness 
of her nearness she was sitting in an armchair placed sideways screening the light of 
the candle from him and was knitting a stocking she had learned to knit stockings 
since prince andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as 
old nurses who knit stockings and that there is something soothing in the knitting of 
stockings the needles clicked lightly in her slender rapidly moving hands and he could clearly 
see the thoughtful profile of her drooping face she moved and the ball rolled off 
her knees she started glanced round at him and screening the candle with her hand 
stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement picked up the ball and regained her 
former position he looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw 
a deep breath after stooping but refrained from doing so and breathed cautiously at the 
tróitsa monastery they had spoken of the past and he had told her that if 
he lived he would always thank god for his wound which had brought them together 
again but after that they never spoke of the future it or can it not 
be he now thought as he looked at her and listened to the light click 
of the steel needles fate have brought me to her so strangely only for me 
to die is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me 
only to show me that i have spent my life in falsity i love her 
more than anything in the world but what am i to do if i love 
her he thought and he involuntarily groaned from a habit acquired during his sufferings on 
hearing that sound natásha put down the stocking leaned nearer to him and suddenly noticing 
his shining eyes stepped lightly up to him and bent over him are not asleep 
i have been looking at you a long time i felt you come in no 
one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do that light i 
want to weep for joy natásha drew closer to him her face shone with rapturous 
joy i love you too much more than anything in the world i turned away 
for an instant too much she asked too much well what do you what do 
you feel in your soul your whole i live what do you think am sure 
of it sure natásha almost shouted taking hold of both his hands with a passionate 
movement he remained silent awhile good it would be and taking her hand he kissed 
it natásha felt happy and agitated but at once remembered that this would not do 
and that he had to be quiet you have not slept she said repressing her 
joy to sleep please he pressed her hand and released it and she went back 
to the candle and sat down again in her former position twice she turned and 
looked at him and her eyes met his beaming at her she set herself a 
task on her stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished soon 
he really shut his eyes and fell asleep he did not sleep long and suddenly 
awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration as he fell asleep he had 
still been thinking of the subject that now always occupied his life and death and 
chiefly about death he felt himself nearer to it what is love he thought hinders 
death love is life all everything that i understand i understand only because i love 
everything is everything exists only because i love everything is united by it alone love 
is god and to die means that i a particle of love shall return to 
the general and eternal source these thoughts seemed to him comforting but they were only 
thoughts something was lacking in them they were not clear they were too one sidedly 
personal and brain spun and there was the former agitation and obscurity he fell asleep 
he dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in but that 
he was quite well and unwounded many various indifferent and insignificant people appeared before him 
he talked to them and discussed something trivial they were preparing to go away somewhere 
prince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important 
cares but he continued to speak surprising them by empty witticisms gradually unnoticed all these 
persons began to disappear and a single question that of the closed door superseded all 
else he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everything depended 
on whether he was or was not in time to lock it he went and 
tried to hurry but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not 
be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers he 
was seized by an agonizing fear and that fear was the fear of death it 
stood behind the door but just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door that 
dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way 
in something not breaking in through that door and had to be kept out he 
seized the door making a final effort to hold it lock it was no longer 
his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door pushed from behind by that terror 
opened and closed again once again it pushed from outside his last superhuman efforts were 
vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened it entered and it was death 
and prince andrew died but at the instant he died prince andrew remembered that he 
was asleep and at the very instant he died having made an effort he awoke 
it was death i woke up yes death is an awakening and all at once 
it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the 
unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision he felt as if powers till then confined 
within him had been liberated and that strange lightness did not again leave him when 
waking in a cold perspiration he moved on the divan natásha went up and asked 
him what was the matter he did not answer and looked at her strangely not 
understanding that was what had happened to him two days before princess arrival from that 
day as the doctor expressed it the wasting fever assumed a malignant character but what 
the doctor said did not interest natásha she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to 
her were more convincing from that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew 
together with his awakening from sleep and compared to the duration of life it did 
not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration of 
a dream there was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow awakening his last 
days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way both princess mary and natásha 
who did not leave him felt this they did not weep or shudder and during 
these last days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him he was 
no longer there he had left them but on what reminded them most closely of 
body both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did 
not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief neither 
in his presence nor out of it did they weep nor did they ever talk 
to one another about him they felt that they could not express in words what 
they understood they both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly deeper and deeper 
away from them and they both knew that this had to be so and that 
it was right he confessed and received communion everyone came to take leave of him 
when they brought his son to him he pressed his lips to the and turned 
away not because he felt it hard and sad princess mary and natásha understood that 
but simply because he thought it was all that was required of him but when 
they told him to bless the boy he did what was demanded and looked round 
as if asking whether there was anything else he should do when the last convulsions 
of the body which the spirit was leaving occurred princess mary and natásha were present 
it over said princess mary when his body had for a few minutes lain motionless 
growing cold before them natásha went up looked at the dead eyes and hastened to 
close them she closed them but did not kiss them but clung to that which 
reminded her most nearly of body has he gone where is he now when the 
body washed and dressed lay in the coffin on a table everyone came to take 
leave of him and they all wept little nicholas cried because his heart was rent 
by painful perplexity the countess and sónya cried from pity for natásha and because he 
was no more the old count cried because he felt that before long he too 
must take the same terrible step natásha and princess mary also wept now but not 
because of their own personal grief they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which 
had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and solemn mystery 
of death that had been accomplished in their presence book thirteen 1812 chapter i mind 
cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness but the desire to find those 
causes is implanted in soul and without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions 
any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause he snatches at 
the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says is the 
cause in historical events where the actions of men are the subject of observation the 
first and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the gods and 
after that the will of those who stood in the most prominent heroes of history 
but we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic lies in the activity 
of the general mass of men who take part in be convinced that the will 
of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself 
continually controlled it may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the 
meaning of historical events this way or that yet there is the same difference between 
a man who says that the people of the west moved on the east because 
napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to 
happen as there is between those who declared that the earth was stationary and that 
the planets moved round it and those who admitted that they did not know what 
upheld the earth but knew there were laws directing its movement and that of the 
other planets there is and can be no cause of an historical event except the 
one cause of all causes but there are laws directing events and some of these 
laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend the 
discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to 
find the cause in the will of some one man just as the discovery of 
the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only when men abandoned the 
conception of the fixity of the earth the historians consider that next to the battle 
of borodinó and the occupation of moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire 
the most important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the russian 
army from the ryazána to the kalúga road and to the tarútino so called flank 
march across the krásnaya pakhrá river they ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius 
to different men and dispute as to whom the honor is due even foreign historians 
including the french acknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of that 
flank march but it is hard to understand why military writers and following them others 
consider this flank march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved 
russia and destroyed napoleon in the first place it is hard to understand where the 
profundity and genius of this movement lay for not much mental effort was needed to 
see that the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is 
where there are most provisions and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed 
that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscow in 1812 was 
on the kalúga road so it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the historians 
reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one and it is even more 
difficult to understand just why they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia 
and destroy the french for this flank march had it been preceded accompanied or followed 
by other circumstances might have proved ruinous to the russians and salutary for the french 
if the position of the russian army really began to improve from the time of 
that march it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of 
it that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the 
russian army but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction what would have 
happened had moscow not burned down if murat had not lost sight of the russians 
if napoleon had not remained inactive if the russian army at krásnaya pakhrá had given 
battle as bennigsen and barclay advised what would have happened had the french attacked the 
russians while they were marching beyond the pakhrá what would have happened if on approaching 
tarútino napoleon had attacked the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had 
shown when he attacked them at smolénsk what would have happened had the french moved 
on petersburg in any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation might have 
proved disastrous the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying history deliberately avoid 
seeing that this flank march cannot be attributed to any one man that no one 
ever foresaw it and that in reality like the retreat from filí it did not 
suggest itself to anyone in its entirety but by moment step by step event by 
an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when 
it had been accomplished and belonged to the past at the council at filí the 
prevailing thought in the minds of the russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself 
namely a direct retreat by the nízhni road in proof of this there is the 
fact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat and above all 
there is the well known conversation after the council between the commander in chief and 
lanskóy who was in charge of the commissariat department lanskóy informed the commander in chief 
that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the oká in the 
túla and ryazán provinces and that if they retreated on nízhni the army would be 
separated from its supplies by the broad river oká which cannot be crossed early in 
winter this was the first indication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously 
seemed the most natural direct retreat on nízhni nóvgorod the army turned more to the 
south along the ryazán road and nearer to its supplies subsequently the inactivity of the 
french who even lost sight of the russian army concern for the safety of the 
arsenal at túla and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the 
army to turn still further south to the túla road having crossed over by a 
forced march to the túla road beyond the pakhrá the russian commanders intended to remain 
at podólsk and had no thought of the tarútino position but innumerable circumstances and the 
reappearance of french troops who had for a time lost touch with the russians and 
projects of giving battle and above all the abundance of provisions in kalúga province obliged 
our army to turn still more to the south and to cross from the túla 
to the kalúga road and go to tarútino which was between the roads along which 
those supplies lay just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to 
abandon moscow so it is impossible to say precisely when or by whom it was 
decided to move to tarútino only when the army had got there as the result 
of innumerable and varying forces did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired 
this movement and long ago foreseen its result chapter ii the famous flank movement merely 
consisted in this after the advance of the french had ceased the russian army which 
had been continually retreating straight back from the invaders deviated from that direct course and 
not finding itself pursued was naturally drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant if 
instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the russian army we picture that 
army without any leaders it could not have done anything but make a return movement 
toward moscow describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found 
and where the country was richest that movement from the nízhni to the ryazán túla 
and kalúga roads was so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that direction 
and demands were sent from petersburg for kutúzov to take his army that way at 
tarútino kutúzov received what was almost a reprimand from the emperor for having moved his 
army along the ryazán road and the letter indicated to him the very position he 
had already occupied near kalúga having rolled like a ball in the direction of the 
impetus given by the whole campaign and by the battle of borodinó the russian the 
strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was the position natural to 
it merit lay not in any strategic maneuver of genius as it is called but 
in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had happened he alone 
then understood the meaning of the french inactivity he alone continued to assert that the 
battle of borodinó had been a victory he as commander in chief might have been 
expected to be eager to his whole strength to restrain the russian army from useless 
engagements the beast wounded at borodinó was lying where the fleeing hunter had left him 
but whether he was still alive whether he was strong and merely lying low the 
hunter did not know suddenly the beast was heard to moan the moan of that 
wounded beast the french army which betrayed its calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston 
to camp with overtures for peace napoleon with his usual assurance that whatever entered his 
head was right wrote to kutúzov the first words that occurred to him though they 
were meaningless monsieur le prince koutouzov i am sending one of my adjutants general to 
discuss several interesting questions with you i beg your highness to credit what he says 
to you especially when he expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard i have 
long entertained for your person this letter having no other object i pray god monsieur 
le prince koutouzov to keep you in his holy and gracious protection napoleon moscow october 
30 1812 kutúzov replied should be cursed by posterity were i looked on as the 
initiator of a settlement of any sort such is the present spirit of my nation 
but he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking during 
the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and the russian troops were 
quietly encamped at tarútino a change had taken place in the relative strength of the 
two in spirit and in a result of which the superiority had passed to the 
russian side though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknown to the 
russians as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself 
by countless signs these signs were mission the abundance of provisions at tarútino the reports 
coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the french the flow 
of recruits to our regiments the fine weather the long rest the russian soldiers had 
enjoyed and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for which usually shows 
itself in an army that has been resting curiosity as to what the french army 
so long lost sight of was doing the boldness with which our outposts now scouted 
close up to the french stationed at tarútino the news of easy successes gained by 
peasants and guerrilla troops over the french the envy aroused by this the desire for 
revenge that lay in the heart of every russian as long as the french were 
in moscow and above all a dim consciousness in every mind that the relative strength 
of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side there 
was a substantial change in the relative strength and an advance had become inevitable and 
at once as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute 
hand has completed a full circle this change was shown by an increased activity whirring 
and chiming in the higher spheres chapter iii the russian army was commanded by kutúzov 
and his staff and also by the emperor from petersburg before the news of the 
abandonment of moscow had been received in petersburg a detailed plan of the whole campaign 
had been drawn up and sent to kutúzov for his guidance though this plan had 
been drawn up on the supposition that moscow was still in our hands it was 
approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action kutúzov only replied that 
movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute so fresh instructions were sent 
for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered as well as fresh people who 
were to watch actions and report upon them besides this the whole staff of the 
russian army was now reorganized the posts left vacant by bagratión who had been killed 
and by barclay who had gone away in dudgeon had to be filled very serious 
consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to put a in 
place and b in or on the contrary to put d in place and so 
if anything more than or satisfaction depended on this as a result of the hostility 
between kutúzov and bennigsen his chief of staff the presence of confidential representatives of the 
emperor and these transfers a more than usually complicated play of parties was going on 
among the staff of the army a was undermining b d was undermining c and 
so on in all possible combinations and permutations in all these plottings the subject of 
intrigue was generally the conduct of the war which all these men believed they were 
directing but this affair of the war went on independently of them as it had 
to go that is never in the way people devised but flowing always from the 
essential attitude of the masses only in the highest spheres did all these schemes crossings 
and interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen prince michael 
ilariónovich wrote the emperor on the second of october in a letter that reached kutúzov 
after the battle at tarútino since september 2 moscow has been in the hands of 
the enemy your last reports were written on the twentieth and during all this time 
not only has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of 
the ancient capital but according to your last report you have even retreated farther sérpukhov 
is already occupied by an enemy detachment and túla with its famous arsenal so indispensable 
to the army is in danger from general reports i see that an enemy corps 
of ten thousand men is moving on the petersburg road another corps of several thousand 
men is moving on dmítrov a third has advanced along the vladímir road and a 
fourth rather considerable detachment is stationed between rúza and mozháysk napoleon himself was in moscow 
as late as the twenty fifth in view of all this information when the enemy 
has scattered his forces in large detachments and with napoleon and his guards in moscow 
is it possible that the forces confronting you are so considerable as not to allow 
of your taking the offensive on the contrary he is probably pursuing you with detachments 
or at most with an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you 
it would seem that availing yourself of these circumstances you might advantageously attack a weaker 
one and annihilate him or at least oblige him to retreat retaining in our hands 
an important part of the provinces now occupied by the enemy and thereby averting danger 
from túla and other towns in the interior you will be responsible if the enemy 
is able to direct a force of any size against petersburg to threaten this capital 
in which it has not been possible to retain many troops for with the army 
entrusted to you and acting with resolution and energy you have ample means to avert 
this fresh calamity remember that you have still to answer to our offended country for 
the loss of moscow you have experienced my readiness to reward you that readiness will 
not weaken in me but i and russia have a right to expect from you 
all the zeal firmness and success which your intellect military talent and the courage of 
the troops you command justify us in expecting but by the time this letter which 
proved that the real relation of the forces had already made itself felt in petersburg 
was dispatched kutúzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he commanded 
from attacking and a battle had taken place on the second of october a cossack 
shapoválov who was out scouting killed one hare and wounded another following the wounded hare 
he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of 
army encamped there without any precautions the cossack laughingly told his comrades how he had 
almost fallen into the hands of the french a cornet hearing the story informed his 
commander the cossack was sent for and questioned the cossack officers wished to take advantage 
of this chance to capture some horses but one of the superior officers who was 
acquainted with the higher authorities reported the incident to a general on the staff the 
state of things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained ermólov had been 
to see bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his influence 
with the commander in chief to induce him to take the offensive i did not 
know you i should think you did not want what you are asking for i 
need only advise anything and his highness is sure to do the opposite replied bennigsen 
the report confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out was the final proof that 
events had matured the tightly coiled spring was released the clock began to whirr and 
the chimes to play despite all his supposed power his intellect his experience and his 
knowledge of men taken into consideration the report a note from bennigsen who sent personal 
reports to the emperor the wishes he supposed the emperor to hold and the fact 
that all the generals expressed the same no longer check the inevitable movement and gave 
the order to do what he regarded as useless and his approval that is to 
the accomplished fact chapter iv note and the information that the left flank of the 
french was unguarded were merely final indications that it was necessary to order an attack 
and it was fixed for the fifth of october on the morning of the fourth 
of october kutúzov signed the dispositions toll read them to ermólov asking him to attend 
to the further arrangements right i time just now replied ermólov and left the hut 
the dispositions drawn up by toll were very good as in the austerlitz dispositions it 
was not in german this time first column will march here and here second column 
will march there and there and so on and on paper all these columns arrived 
at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy everything had been admirably 
thought out as is usual in dispositions and as is always the case not a 
single column reached its place at the appointed time when the necessary number of copies 
of the dispositions had been prepared an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them 
to ermólov to deal with a young officer of the horse guards orderly pleased at 
the importance of the mission entrusted to him went to quarters away said orderly the 
officer of the horse guards went to a general with whom ermólov was often to 
be found and the out too the officer mounting his horse rode off to someone 
else gone out only they make me responsible for this delay what a nuisance it 
is thought the officer and he rode round the whole camp one man said he 
had seen ermólov ride past with some other generals others said he must have returned 
home the officer searched till six in the evening without even stopping to eat ermólov 
was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was the officer snatched 
a little food at a and rode again to the vanguard to find milorádovich milorádovich 
too was away but here he was told that he had gone to a ball 
at general and that ermólov was probably there too where is it there over at 
échkino said a cossack officer pointing to a country house in the far distance outside 
our line put two regiments as outposts and having such a spree there awful two 
bands and three sets of singers the officer rode out beyond our lines to échkino 
while still at a distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a 
dance song proceeding from the house the meadows in the meadows he heard accompanied by 
whistling and the sound of a torban drowned every now and then by shouts these 
sounds made his spirits rise but at the same time he was afraid that he 
would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order entrusted to him it 
was already past eight he dismounted and went up into the porch of a large 
country house which had remained intact between the russian and french forces in the refreshment 
room and the hall footmen were bustling about with wine and viands groups of singers 
stood outside the windows the officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals 
of the army together and among them big imposing figure they all had their coats 
unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces laughing loudly in 
the middle of the room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing 
the trepák with much spirit and agility ha ha bravo nicholas iványch ha ha ha 
the officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment he was 
doubly to blame and he would have preferred to wait but one of the generals 
espied him and hearing what he had come about informed ermólov ermólov came forward with 
a frown on his face and hearing what the officer had to say took the 
papers from him without a word think he went off just by chance said a 
comrade who was on the staff that evening to the officer of the horse guards 
referring to ermólov was a trick it was done on purpose to get konovnítsyn into 
trouble see what a mess be tomorrow chapter v next day the decrepit kutúzov having 
given orders to be called early said his prayers dressed and with an unpleasant consciousness 
of having to direct a battle he did not approve of got into his calèche 
and drove from letashóvka a village three and a half miles from tarútino to the 
place where the attacking columns were to meet he sat in the calèche dozing and 
waking up by turns and listening for any sound of firing on the right as 
an indication that the action had begun but all was still quiet a damp dull 
autumn morning was just dawning on approaching tarútino kutúzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to 
water across the road along which he was driving kutúzov looked at them searchingly stopped 
his carriage and inquired what regiment they belonged to they belonged to a column that 
should have been far in front and in ambush long before then may be a 
mistake thought the old commander in chief but a little further on he saw infantry 
regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers only partly dressed eating their rye porridge 
and carrying fuel he sent for an officer the officer reported that no order to 
advance had been received not rec kutúzov began but checked himself immediately and sent for 
a senior officer getting out of his calèche he waited with drooping head and breathing 
heavily pacing silently up and down when eýkhen the officer of the general staff whom 
he had summoned appeared kutúzov went purple in the face not because that officer was 
to blame for the mistake but because he was an object of sufficient importance for 
him to vent his wrath on trembling and panting the old man fell into that 
state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the ground and he 
fell upon eýkhen threatening him with his hands shouting and loading him with gross abuse 
another man captain brózin who happened to turn up and who was not at all 
to blame suffered the same fate sort of another blackguard are you have you shot 
scoundrels yelled kutúzov in a hoarse voice waving his arms and reeling he was suffering 
physically he the commander in chief a serene highness who everybody said possessed powers such 
as no man had ever had in russia to be placed in this the laughingstock 
of the whole army have been in such a hurry to pray about today or 
have kept awake thinking everything over all night thought he to himself i was a 
chit of an officer no one would have dared to mock me so and now 
he was in a state of physical suffering as if from corporal punishment and could 
not avoid expressing it by cries of anger and distress but his strength soon began 
to fail him and looking about him conscious of having said much that was amiss 
he again got into his calèche and drove back in silence his wrath once expended 
did not return and blinking feebly he listened to excuses and self justifications ermólov did 
not come to see him till the next day and to the insistence of bennigsen 
konovnítsyn and toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next day and 
once more kutúzov had to consent chapter vi next day the troops assembled in their 
appointed places in the evening and advanced during the night it was an autumn night 
with dark purple clouds but no rain the ground was damp but not muddy and 
the troops advanced noiselessly only occasionally a jingling of the artillery could be faintly heard 
the men were forbidden to talk out loud to smoke their pipes or to strike 
a light and they tried to prevent their horses neighing the secrecy of the undertaking 
heightened its charm and they marched gaily some columns supposing they had reached their destination 
halted piled arms and settled down on the cold ground but the majority marched all 
night and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been only count orlóv 
denísov with his cossacks the least important detachment of all got to his appointed place 
at the right time this detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest on the 
path leading from the village of stromílova to dmítrovsk toward dawn count orlóv denísov who 
had dozed off was awakened by a deserter from the french army being brought to 
him this was a polish sergeant of corps who explained in polish that he had 
come over because he had been slighted in the service that he ought long ago 
to have been made an officer that he was braver than any of them and 
so he had left them and wished to pay them out he said that murat 
was spending the night less than a mile from where they were and that if 
they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would capture him 
alive count orlóv denísov consulted his fellow officers the offer was too tempting to be 
refused everyone volunteered to go and everybody advised making the attempt after much disputing and 
arguing major general grékov with two cossack regiments decided to go with the polish sergeant 
remember said count orlóv denísov to the sergeant at parting you have been lying have 
you hanged like a dog but if true you shall have a hundred gold pieces 
without replying the sergeant with a resolute air mounted and rode away with grékov whose 
men had quickly assembled they disappeared into the forest and count orlóv denísov having seen 
grékov off returned shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what 
he had undertaken on his own responsibility and began looking at the enemy camp now 
just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying campfires our columns ought 
to have begun to appear on an open declivity to his right he looked in 
that direction but though the columns would have been visible quite far off they were 
not to be seen it seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir 
in the french camp and his keen sighted adjutant confirmed this it is really too 
late said count orlóv looking at the camp as often happens when someone we have 
trusted is no longer before our eyes it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to 
him that the sergeant was an impostor that he had lied and that the whole 
russian attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which he would 
lead away heaven only knew where how could one capture a commander in chief from 
among such a mass of troops am sure that rascal was lying said the count 
can still be called back said one of his suite who like count orlóv felt 
distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the camp really what do you think 
should we let them go on or not you have them fetched back them back 
fetch them back said count orlóv with sudden determination looking at his watch will be 
too late it is quite light and the adjutant galloped through the forest after grékov 
when grékov returned count orlóv denísov excited both by the abandoned attempt and by vainly 
awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear as well as by the proximity 
of the enemy resolved to advance all his men felt the same excitement he commanded 
in a whisper the men took their places and crossed themselves with aid ah ah 
reverberated in the forest and the cossack companies trailing their lances and advancing one after 
another as if poured out of a sack dashed gaily across the brook toward the 
camp one desperate frightened yell from the first french soldier who saw the cossacks and 
all who were in the camp undressed and only just waking up ran off in 
all directions abandoning cannons muskets and horses had the cossacks pursued the french without heeding 
what was behind and around them they would have captured murat and everything there that 
was what the officers desired but it was impossible to make the cossacks budge when 
once they had got booty and prisoners none of them listened to orders fifteen hundred 
prisoners and thirty eight guns were taken on the spot besides standards and what seemed 
most important to the cossacks horses saddles horsecloths and the like all this had to 
be dealt with the prisoners and guns secured the booty without some shouting and even 
a little fighting among it was on this that the cossacks all busied themselves the 
french not being farther pursued began to recover themselves they formed into detachments and began 
firing orlóv denísov still waiting for the other columns to arrive advanced no further meantime 
according to the dispositions which said that first column will and so on the infantry 
of the belated columns commanded by bennigsen and directed by toll had started in due 
order and as always happens had got somewhere but not to their appointed places as 
always happens the men starting cheerfully began to halt murmurs were heard there was a 
sense of confusion and finally a backward movement adjutants and generals galloped about shouted grew 
angry quarreled said they had come quite wrong and were late gave vent to a 
little abuse and at last gave it all up and went forward simply to get 
somewhere shall get somewhere or other and they did indeed get somewhere though not to 
their right places a few eventually even got to their right place but too late 
to be of any use and only in time to be fired at toll who 
in this battle played the part of weyrother at austerlitz galloped assiduously from place to 
place finding everything upside down everywhere thus he stumbled on corps in a wood when 
it was already broad daylight though the corps should long before have joined orlóv denísov 
excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it 
toll galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely saying 
that he ought to be shot general bagovút a fighting old soldier of placid temperament 
being also upset by all the delay confusion and cross purposes fell into a rage 
to surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to toll 
prefer not to take lessons from anyone but i can die with my men as 
well as anybody he said and advanced with a single division coming out onto a 
field under the fire this brave general went straight ahead leading his men under fire 
without considering in his agitation whether going into action now with a single division would 
be of any use or no danger cannon balls and bullets were just what he 
needed in his angry mood one of the first bullets killed him and other bullets 
killed many of his men and his division remained under fire for some time quite 
uselessly chapter vii meanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the front 
but kutúzov accompanied that column he well knew that nothing but confusion would come of 
this battle undertaken against his will and as far as was in his power held 
the troops back he did not advance he rode silently on his small gray horse 
indolently answering suggestions that they should attack word attack is always on your tongue but 
you see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers said he to milorádovich who 
asked permission to advance take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in 
time and nothing can be done now he replied to someone else when kutúzov was 
informed that at the french according to the reports of the cossacks there had previously 
been were now two battalions of poles he gave a sidelong glance at ermólov who 
was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day see 
they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds but as soon as 
one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemy forewarned takes measures accordingly ermólov 
screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words he understood that for 
him the storm had blown over and that kutúzov would content himself with that hint 
having a little fun at my expense said ermólov softly nudging with his knee raévski 
who was at his side soon after this ermólov moved up to kutúzov and respectfully 
remarked is not too late yet your enemy has not gone you were to order 
an attack if not the guards will not so much as see a little smoke 
kutúzov did not reply but when they reported to him that troops were in retreat 
he ordered an advance though at every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of 
an hour the whole battle consisted in what orlóv cossacks had done the rest of 
the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly in consequence of this battle kutúzov 
received a diamond decoration and bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles others also 
received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades and following the battle fresh changes were 
made in the staff how everything is done with us all topsy turvy said the 
russian officers and generals after the tarútino battle letting it be understood that some fool 
there is doing things all wrong but that we ourselves should not have done so 
just as people speak today but people who talk like that either do not know 
what they are talking about or deliberately deceive themselves no borodinó or place as those 
who planned it anticipated that is an essential condition a countless number of free forces 
for nowhere is man freer than during a battle where it is a question of 
life and death influence the course taken by the fight and that course never can 
be known in advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force if 
many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given body the direction of its 
motion cannot coincide with any one of those forces but will always be a in 
mechanics is represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces if in the descriptions 
given by historians especially french ones we find their wars and battles carried out in 
accordance with previously formed plans the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions 
are false the battle of tarútino obviously did not attain the aim toll had in 
lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions nor that which 
count orlóv denísov may have had in take murat prisoner nor the result of immediately 
destroying the whole corps which bennigsen and others may have had in view nor the 
aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself nor that 
of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got and so on but if 
the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the russians of 
that day drive the french out of russia and destroy their is quite clear that 
the battle of tarútino just because of its incongruities was exactly what was wanted at 
that stage of the campaign it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any 
result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle with a minimum of effort 
and insignificant losses despite the greatest confusion the most important results of the whole campaign 
were attained the transition from retreat to advance an exposure of the weakness of the 
french and the administration of that shock which army had only awaited to begin its 
flight chapter viii napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa there can 
be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the 
french the russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital moscow abounding in provisions arms munitions 
and incalculable wealth is in hands the russian army only half the strength of the 
french does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month position is 
most brilliant he can either fall on the russian army with double its strength and 
destroy it negotiate an advantageous peace or in case of a refusal make a menacing 
move on petersburg or even in the case of a reverse return to smolénsk or 
vílna or remain in moscow in short no special genius would seem to be required 
to retain the brilliant position the french held at that time for that only very 
simple and easy steps were necessary not to allow the troops to loot to prepare 
winter which there was sufficient in moscow for the whole methodically to collect the provisions 
of which according to the french historians there were enough in moscow to supply the 
whole army for six months yet napoleon that greatest of all geniuses who the historians 
declare had control of the army took none of these steps he not merely did 
nothing of the kind but on the contrary he used his power to select the 
most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to him of all that napoleon 
might have done wintering in moscow advancing on petersburg or on nízhni nóvgorod or retiring 
by a more northerly or more southerly route say by the road kutúzov afterwards took 
nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he actually did he remained 
in moscow till october letting the troops plunder the city then hesitating whether to leave 
a garrison behind him he quitted moscow approached kutúzov without joining battle turned to the 
right and reached málo yaroslávets again without attempting to break through and take the road 
kutúzov took but retiring instead to mozháysk along the devastated smolénsk road nothing more stupid 
than that could have been devised or more disastrous for the army as the sequel 
showed had aim been to destroy his army the most skillful strategist could hardly have 
devised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose independently of 
anything the russian army might do napoleon the man of genius did this but to 
say that he destroyed his army because he wished to or because he was very 
stupid would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to 
moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a genius in 
both cases his personal activity having no more force than the personal activity of any 
soldier merely coincided with the laws that guided the event the historians quite falsely represent 
faculties as having weakened in moscow and do so only because the results did not 
justify his actions he employed all his ability and strength to do the best he 
could for himself and his army as he had done previously and as he did 
subsequently in 1813 his activity at that time was no less astounding than it was 
in egypt in italy in austria and in prussia we do not know for certain 
in how far his genius was genuine in forty centuries looked down upon his his 
great exploits there are all told us by frenchmen we cannot accurately estimate his genius 
in austria or prussia for we have to draw our information from french or german 
sources and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without fighting and of fortresses without a 
siege must incline germans to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war 
carried on in germany but we thank god have no need to recognize his genius 
in order to hide our shame we have paid for the right to look at 
the matter plainly and simply and we will not abandon that right his activity in 
moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere order after order and 
plan after plan were issued by him from the time he entered moscow till the 
time he left it the absence of citizens and of a deputation and even the 
burning of moscow did not disconcert him he did not lose sight either of the 
welfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy or of the welfare 
of the people of russia or of the direction of affairs in paris or of 
diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace chapter ix with regard to military 
matters napoleon immediately on his entry into moscow gave general sabastiani strict orders to observe 
the movements of the russian army sent army corps out along the different roads and 
charged murat to find kutúzov then he gave careful directions about the fortification of the 
krémlin and drew up a brilliant plan for a future campaign over the whole map 
of russia with regard to diplomatic questions napoleon summoned captain yákovlev who had been robbed 
and was in rags and did not know how to get out of moscow minutely 
explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity and having written a letter to 
the emperor alexander in which he considered it his duty to inform his friend and 
brother that rostopchín had managed affairs badly in moscow he dispatched yákovlev to petersburg having 
similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to tutólmin he dispatched that old man also 
to petersburg to negotiate with regard to legal matters immediately after the fires he gave 
orders to find and execute the incendiaries and the scoundrel rostopchín was punished by an 
order to burn down his houses with regard to administrative matters moscow was granted a 
constitution a municipality was established and the following announcement issued inhabitants of moscow your misfortunes 
are cruel but his majesty the emperor and king desires to arrest their course terrible 
examples have taught you how he punishes disobedience and crime strict measures have been taken

to another unite to defeat the intentions of the evil minded obey the military and

the army napoleon decreed that all the troops in turn should enter moscow à la 
maraude to obtain provisions for themselves so that the army might have its future provided 
for as looters with regard to religion napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back 
and services to be again performed in the churches with regard to commerce and to 
provisioning the army the following was placarded everywhere proclamation you peaceful inhabitants of moscow artisans 
and workmen whom misfortune has driven from the city and you scattered tillers of the

all kinds to two appointed markets of which one is on the mokhováya street and 
the other at the provision market 2 such supplies will be bought from them at 
such prices as seller and buyer may agree on and if a seller is unable 
to obtain a fair price he will be free to take his goods back to 
his village and no one may hinder him under any pretense 3 sunday and wednesday 
of each week are appointed as the chief market days and to that end a 
sufficient number of troops will be stationed along the highroads on tuesdays and saturdays at 
such distances from the town as to protect the carts 4 similar measures will be 
taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their

king and to co operate with him for the public welfare lay your respect and 
confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us with the object 
of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people reviews were constantly held 
and rewards distributed the emperor rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants and despite 
his preoccupation with state affairs himself visited the theaters that were established by his order 
in regard to philanthropy the greatest virtue of crowned heads napoleon also did all in 
his power he caused the words maison de ma mère to be inscribed on the 
charitable institutions thereby combining tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch he 
visited the foundling hospital and allowing the orphans saved by him to kiss his white 
hands graciously conversed with tutólmin then as thiers eloquently recounts he ordered his soldiers to 
be paid in forged russian money which he had prepared the use of these means 
by an act worthy of himself and of the french army he let relief be 
distributed to those who had been burned out but as food was too precious to 
be given to foreigners who were for the most part enemies napoleon preferred to supply 
them with money with which to purchase food from outside and had paper rubles distributed 
to them with reference to army discipline orders were continually being issued to inflict severe 
punishment for the nonperformance of military duties and to suppress robbery chapter x but strange 
to say all these measures efforts and were not at all worse than others issued 
in similar not affect the essence of the matter but like the hands of a 
clock detached from the mechanism swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without engaging 
the cogwheels with reference to the military plan of work of genius of which thiers 
remarks that genius never devised anything more profound more skillful or more admirable and enters 
into a polemic with m fain to prove that this work of genius must be 
referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of plan never was or could 
be executed for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the case 
the fortifying of the krémlin for which la mosquée as napoleon termed the church of 
basil the beatified was to have been razed to the ground proved quite useless the 
mining of the krémlin only helped toward fulfilling wish that it should be blown up 
when he left a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to 
be beaten the pursuit of the russian army about which napoleon was so concerned produced 
an unheard of result the french generals lost touch with the russian army of sixty 
thousand men and according to thiers it was only eventually found like a lost pin 
by the apparently the murat with reference to diplomacy all arguments as to his magnanimity 
and justice both to tutólmin and to yákovlev whose chief concern was to obtain a 
greatcoat and a conveyance proved useless alexander did not receive these envoys and did not 
reply to their embassage with regard to legal matters after the execution of the supposed 
incendiaries the rest of moscow burned down with regard to administrative matters the establishment of 
a municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain people 
who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of preserving order looted moscow or 
saved their own property from being looted with regard to religion as to which in 
egypt matters had so easily been settled by visit to a mosque no results were 
achieved two or three priests who were found in moscow did try to carry out 
wish but one of them was slapped in the face by a french soldier while 
conducting service and a french official reported of another that priest whom i found and 
invited to say mass cleaned and locked up the church that night the doors were 
again broken open the padlocks smashed the books mutilated and other disorders perpetrated with reference 
to commerce the proclamation to industrious workmen and to peasants evoked no response there were 
no industrious workmen and the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of 
town with the proclamation and killed them as to the theaters for the entertainment of 
the people and the troops these did not meet with success either the theaters set 
up in the krémlin and in house were closed again at once because the actors 
and actresses were robbed even philanthropy did not have the desired effect the genuine as 
well as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value the french collecting 
booty cared only for gold not only was the paper money valueless which napoleon so 
graciously distributed to the unfortunate but even silver lost its value in relation to gold 
but the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities 
at that time was attempt to stop the looting and re establish discipline this is 
what the army authorities were reporting continues in the city despite the decrees against it 
order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in 
a lawful manner the sutlers alone venture to trade and they sell stolen goods neighborhood 
of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the 3rd corps who not 
satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have 
left even have the ferocity to wound them with their sabers as i have repeatedly 
witnessed new except that the soldiers are robbing and 9 and pillaging continue there is 
a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong 
11 emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage parties of 
marauding guards are continually seen returning to the krémlin among the old guard disorder and 
pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening last night and today the emperor 
sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his person who should set 
an example of discipline carry disobedience to such a point that they break into the 
cellars and stores containing army supplies others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying 
sentinels and officers and have abused and beaten them grand marshal of the palace wrote 
the governor bitterly that in spite of repeated orders the soldiers continue to commit nuisances 
in all the courtyards and even under the very windows of the emperor that army 
like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the provender which might have 
saved it from starvation disintegrated and perished with each additional day it remained in moscow 
but it did not go away it began to run away only when suddenly seized 
by a panic caused by the capture of transport trains on the smolénsk road and 
by the battle of tarútino the news of that battle of tarútino unexpectedly received by 
napoleon at a review evoked in him a desire to punish the russians thiers says 
and he issued the order for departure which the whole army was demanding fleeing from 
moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had stolen napoleon too carried away his 
own personal trésor but on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army he was 
thiers says horror struck and yet with his experience of war he did not order 
all the superfluous vehicles to be burned as he had done with those of a 
certain marshal when approaching moscow he gazed at the calèches and carriages in which soldiers 
were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing as those vehicles could 
be used to carry provisions the sick and the wounded the plight of the whole 
army resembled that of a wounded animal which feels it is perishing and does not 
know what it is doing to study the skillful tactics and aims of napoleon and 
his army from the time it entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying 
the dying leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded animal very often a wounded animal 
hearing a rustle rushes straight at the gun runs forward and back again and hastens 
its own end napoleon under pressure from his whole army did the same thing the 
rustle of the battle of tarútino frightened the beast and it rushed forward onto the 
gun reached him turned back and any wild back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous 
path where the old scent was familiar during the whole of that period napoleon who 
seems to us to have been the leader of all these the figurehead of a 
ship may seem to a savage to guide the like a child who holding a 
couple of strings inside a carriage thinks he is driving it chapter xi early in 
the morning of the sixth of october pierre went out of the shed and on 
returning stopped by the door to play with a little blue gray dog with a 
long body and short bandy legs that jumped about him this little dog lived in 
their shed sleeping beside karatáev at night it sometimes made excursions into the town but 
always returned again probably it had never had an owner and it still belonged to 
nobody and had no name the french called it azor the soldier who told stories 
called it femgálka karatáev and others called it gray or sometimes flabby its lack of 
a master a name or even of a breed or any definite color did not 
seem to trouble the blue gray dog in the least its furry tail stood up 
firm and round as a plume its bandy legs served it so well that it 
would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three 
legs as if disdaining to use all four everything pleased it now it would roll 
on its back yelping with delight now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air 
of importance and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw 
attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt the only remnant of his former 
clothing a pair of trousers which by advice he tied with string round the ankles 
for warmth and a peasant coat and cap physically he had changed much during this 
time he no longer seemed stout though he still had the appearance of solidity and 
strength hereditary in his family a beard and mustache covered the lower part of his 
face and a tangle of hair infested with lice curled round his head like a 
cap the look of his eyes was resolute calm and animatedly alert as never before 
the former slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by 
an energetic readiness for action and resistance his feet were bare pierre first looked down 
the field across which vehicles and horsemen were passing that morning then into the distance 
across the river then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about 
biting him and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various 
positions moving his dirty thick big toes every time he looked at his bare feet 
a smile of animated self satisfaction flitted across his face the sight of them reminded 
him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection was 
pleasant to him for some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight 
frosts in the is called an summer in the sunshine the air was warm and 
that warmth was particularly pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in 
the air on and the magic crystal glitter seen only at that time of autumn 
the sparrow hills were visible in the distance with the village the church and the 
large white house the bare trees the sand the bricks and roofs of the houses 
the green church spire and the corners of the white house in the distance all 
stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness near 
by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half burned mansion occupied by the 
french with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence and even that ruined 
and befouled in dull weather was repulsively quietly beautiful now in the clear motionless brilliance 
a french corporal with coat unbuttoned in a homely way a skullcap on his head 
and a short pipe in his mouth came from behind a corner of the shed 
and approached pierre with a friendly wink sunshine monsieur kiril their name for pierre just 
like spring and the corporal leaned against the door and offered pierre his pipe though 
whenever he offered it pierre always declined it be on the march in such weather 
he began pierre inquired what was being said about leaving and the corporal told him 
that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an order about 
the prisoners that day sokolóv one of the soldiers in the shed with pierre was 
dying and pierre told the corporal that something should be done about him the corporal 
replied that pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a 
permanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick and that in general everything 
that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities monsieur kiril you have only to 
say a word to the captain you know he is a man who never forgets 
anything speak to the captain when he makes his round he will do anything for 
you the captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with pierre and 
showed him all sorts of favors see st thomas he said to me the other 
day kiril is a man of education who speaks french he is a russian seigneur 
who has had misfortunes but he is a man he knows what if he wants 
anything and asks me he get a refusal when one has studied you see one 
likes education and well bred people it is for your sake i mention it monsieur 
kiril the other day if it had not been for you that affair would have 
ended ill and after chatting a while longer the corporal went away the affair he 
had alluded to had happened a few days fight between the prisoners and the french 
soldiers in which pierre had succeeded in pacifying his comrades some of the prisoners who 
had heard pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the frenchman had said while 
pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving moscow a thin 
sallow tattered french soldier came up to the door of the shed rapidly and timidly 
raising his fingers to his forehead by way of greeting he asked pierre whether the 
soldier platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that shed 
a week before the french had had boot leather and linen issued to them which 
they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and shirts for 
them ready dear fellow said karatáev coming out with a neatly folded shirt karatáev on 
account of the warm weather and for convenience at work was wearing only trousers and 
a tattered shirt as black as soot his hair was bound round workman fashion with 
a wisp of lime tree bast and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than 
ever promise is own brother to performance i said friday and here it is ready 
said platón smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn the frenchman glanced around uneasily 
and then as if overcoming his hesitation rapidly threw off his uniform and put on 
the shirt he had a long greasy flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow thin 
bare body but no shirt he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on would laugh 
at him and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly none of the prisoners said 
a word it fits well platón kept repeating pulling the shirt straight the frenchman having 
pushed his head and hands through without raising his eyes looked down at the shirt 
and examined the seams see dear man this is not a sewing shop and i 
had no proper tools and as they say one needs a tool even to kill 
a louse said platón with one of his round smiles obviously pleased with his work 
good quite good thank you said the frenchman in french there must be some linen 
left over will fit better still when it sets to your body said karatáev still 
admiring his handiwork be nice and comfortable thanks old fellow but the bits left over 
said the frenchman again and smiled he took out an assignation ruble note and gave 
it to karatáev give me the pieces that are over pierre saw that platón did 
not want to understand what the frenchman was saying and he looked on without interfering 
karatáev thanked the frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work the 
frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked pierre to 
translate what he said does he want the bits for said karatáev make fine leg 
bands for us well never mind and karatáev with a suddenly changed and saddened expression 
took a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the 
frenchman without looking at him dear muttered karatáev and went away the frenchman looked at 
the linen considered for a moment then looked inquiringly at pierre and as if look 
had told him something suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice eh platoche keep 
them yourself and handing back the odd bits he turned and went out look at 
that said karatáev swaying his head said they were not christians but they too have 
souls what the old folk used to say sweating an open hand a dry close 
naked but yet given it back karatáev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at 
the pieces make grand leg bands dear friend he said and went back into the 
shed chapter xii four weeks had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and though 
the french had offered to move him from the to the shed he had stayed 
in the shed where he was first put in burned and devastated moscow pierre experienced 
almost the extreme limits of privation a man can endure but thanks to his physical 
strength and health of which he had till then been unconscious and thanks especially to 
the fact that the privations came so gradually that it was impossible to say when 
they began he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully and just at this 
time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain 
to reach he had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind that inner 
harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of borodinó he 
had sought it in philanthropy in freemasonry in the dissipations of town life in wine 
in heroic feats of self sacrifice and in romantic love for natásha he had sought 
it by all these quests and experiments had failed him and now without thinking about 
it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death 
through privation and through what he recognized in karatáev those dreadful moments he had lived 
through at the executions had as it were forever washed away from his imagination and 
memory the agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important it did not 
now occur to him to think of russia or the war or politics or napoleon 
it was plain to him that all these things were no business of his and 
that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do 
so and summer weather are not bound together he thought repeating words of which he 
found strangely consoling his intention of killing napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number 
of the beast of the apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous his 
anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed 
not merely trivial but even amusing what concern was it of his that somewhere or 
other that woman was leading the life she preferred what did it matter to anybody 
and especially to him whether or not they found out that their name was count 
bezúkhov he now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew and quite agreed with him 
though he understood prince thoughts somewhat differently prince andrew had thought and said that happiness 
could only be negative but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony 
as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is implanted in 
us merely to torment us and never be satisfied but pierre believed it without any 
mental reservation the absence of suffering the satisfaction of needs and consequent freedom in the 
choice of occupation that is of way of life now seemed to pierre to be 
indubitably highest happiness here and now for the first time he fully appreciated the enjoyment 
of eating when he wanted to eat drinking when he wanted to drink sleeping when 
he wanted to sleep of warmth when he was cold of talking to a fellow 
man when he wished to talk and to hear a human voice the satisfaction of 
food cleanliness and that he was deprived of all this seemed to pierre to constitute 
perfect happiness and the choice of occupation that is of his way of that that 
was so to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a superfluity of 
the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying needs while great freedom in the 
choice of freedom as his wealth his education and his social position had given him 
in his own just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult and destroys the 
desire and possibility of having an occupation all daydreams now turned on the time when 
he would be free yet subsequently and for the rest of his life he thought 
and spoke with enthusiasm of that month of captivity of those irrecoverable strong joyful sensations 
and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner freedom which he experienced only 
during those weeks when on the first day he got up early went out of 
the shed at dawn and saw the cupolas and crosses of the new convent of 
the virgin still dark at first the hoarfrost on the dusty grass the sparrow hills 
and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance when he 
felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying 
from moscow across the field and when afterwards light gleamed from the east and the 
rim appeared solemnly from behind a cloud and the cupolas and crosses the hoarfrost the 
distance and the river all began to sparkle in the glad felt a new joy 
and strength in life such as he had never before known and this not only 
stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment but even grew in strength as 
the hardships of his position increased that feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything 
was still further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed of 
him soon after his arrival at the shed with his knowledge of languages the respect 
shown him by the french his simplicity his readiness to give anything asked of him 
he received the allowance of three rubles a week made to officers with his strength 
which he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut 
his gentleness to his companions and his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing 
anything which seemed to them incomprehensible he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior 
being the very qualities that had been a hindrance if not actually harmful to him 
in the world he had lived strength his disdain for the comforts of life his 
absent mindedness and among these people gave him almost the status of a hero and 
pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities upon him chapter xiii the french evacuation began 
on the night between the sixth and seventh of october kitchens and sheds were dismantled 
carts loaded and troops and baggage trains started at seven in the morning a french 
convoy in marching trim wearing shakos and carrying muskets knapsacks and enormous sacks stood in 
front of the sheds and animated french talk mingled with curses sounded all along the 
lines in the shed everyone was ready dressed belted shod and only awaited the order 
to start the sick soldier sokolóv pale and thin with dark shadows round his eyes 
alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed his eyes prominent from the emaciation 
of his face gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention to him 
and he moaned regularly and quietly it was evidently not so much his sufferings that 
caused him to moan he had dysentery as his fear and grief at being left 
alone pierre girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes karatáev had made 
for him from some leather a french soldier had torn off a tea chest and 
brought to have his boots mended with went up to the sick man and squatted 
down beside him know sokolóv they are not all going away they have a hospital 
here you may be better off than we others said pierre lord oh it will 
be the death of me o lord moaned the man in a louder voice go 
and ask them again directly said pierre rising and going to the door of the 
shed just as pierre reached the door the corporal who had offered him a pipe 
the day before came up to it with two soldiers the corporal and soldiers were 
in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal straps and these changed their 
familiar faces the corporal came according to orders to shut the door the prisoners had 
to be counted before being let out what will they do with the sick man 
pierre began but even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the 
corporal he knew or a stranger so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that 
moment moreover just as pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was suddenly heard 
from both sides the corporal frowned at words and uttering some meaningless oaths slammed the 
door the shed became semidark and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides 
drowned the sick groans it is it again said pierre to himself and an involuntary 
shudder ran down his spine in the changed face in the sound of his voice 
in the stirring and deafening noise of the drums he recognized that mysterious callous force 
which compelled people against their will to kill their fellow force the effect of which 
he had witnessed during the executions to fear or to try to escape that force 
to address entreaties or exhortations to those who served as its tools was useless pierre 
knew this now one had to wait and endure he did not again go to 
the sick man nor turn to look at him but stood frowning by the door 
of the hut when that door was opened and the prisoners crowding against one another 
like a flock of sheep squeezed into the exit pierre pushed his way forward and 
approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured him was ready to do 
anything for him the captain was also in marching kit and on his cold face 
appeared that same it which pierre had recognized in the words and in the roll 
of the drums on pass on the captain reiterated frowning sternly and looking at the 
prisoners who thronged past him pierre went up to him though he knew his attempt 
would be vain now the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing 
pierre pierre told him about the sick man manage to walk devil take him said 
the captain on pass on he continued without looking at pierre he is dying pierre 
again began so good shouted the captain frowning angrily da da dam dam dam rattled 
the drums and pierre understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that 
it was now useless to say any more the officer prisoners were separated from the 
soldiers and told to march in front there were about thirty officers with pierre among 
them and about three hundred men the officers who had come from the other sheds 
were all strangers to pierre and much better dressed than he they looked at him 
and at his shoes mistrustfully as at an alien not far from him walked a 
fat major with a sallow bloated angry face who was wearing a kazán dressing gown 
tied round with a towel and who evidently enjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners 
he kept one hand in which he clasped his tobacco pouch inside the bosom of 
his dressing gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other panting 
and puffing the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being 
pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and 
were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at another a 
thin little officer was speaking to everyone conjecturing where they were now being taken and 
how far they would get that day an official in felt boots and wearing a 
commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of moscow 
loudly announcing his observations as to what had been burned down and what this or 
that part of the city was that they could see a third officer who by 
his accent was a pole disputed with the commissariat officer arguing that he was mistaken 
in his identification of the different wards of moscow are you disputing about said the 
major angrily does it matter whether it is st nicholas or st blasius you see 
burned down and an end of it what are you pushing for the road wide 
enough said he turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at 
all oh oh what have they done the prisoners on one side and another were 
heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins beyond the river and zúbova and 
in the krémlin just look not half of it left yes i told whole quarter 
beyond the river and so it is you know burned so the use of talking 
said the major as they passed near a church in the khamóvniki one of the 
few unburned quarters of moscow the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one side 
and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard the villains what heathens yes dead dead 
so he is and smeared with something pierre too drew near the church where the 
thing was that evoked these exclamations and dimly made out something leaning against the palings 
surrounding the church from the words of his comrades who saw better than he did 
he found that this was the body of a man set upright against the palings 
with its face smeared with soot on what the devil go on thirty thousand devils 
the convoy guards began cursing and the french soldiers with fresh virulence drove away with 
their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead man chapter xiv 
through the cross streets of the khamóvniki quarter the prisoners marched followed only by their 
escort and the vehicles and wagons belonging to that escort but when they reached the 
supply stores they came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with 
private vehicles at the bridge they all halted waiting for those in front to get 
across from the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage trains 
before and behind them to the right where the kalúga road turns near neskúchny endless 
rows of troops and carts stretched away into the distance these were troops of corps 
which had started before any of the others behind along the riverside and across the 
stone bridge were troops and transport troops in whose charge were the prisoners were crossing 
the crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the kalúga road but the baggage 
trains stretched out so that the last of train had not yet got out of 
moscow and reached the kalúga road when the vanguard of army was already emerging from 
the great ordýnka street when they had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a 
few steps forward halted and again moved on and from all sides vehicles and men 
crowded closer and closer together they advanced the few hundred paces that separated the bridge 
from the kalúga road taking more than an hour to do so and came out 
upon the square where the streets of the transmoskvá ward and the kalúga road converge 
and the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway 
from all sides like the roar of the sea were heard the rattle of wheels 
the tramp of feet and incessant shouts of anger and abuse pierre stood pressed against 
the wall of a charred house listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination 
with the roll of the drums to get a better view several officer prisoners climbed 
onto the wall of the half burned house against which pierre was leaning crowds just 
look at the crowds loaded goods even on the cannon look there those are furs 
they exclaimed see what the blackguards have looted there see what that one has behind 
in the cart why those are settings taken from some icons by heaven oh the 
rascals see how that fellow has loaded himself up he can hardly walk good lord 
even grabbed those chaises see that fellow there sitting on the trunks heavens fighting right 
hit him on the his snout like this we get away before evening look look 
there why that must be own see what horses and the monograms with a crown 
like a portable house that dropped his sack and see it fighting again a woman 
with a baby and not bad looking either yes i dare say the way let 
you pass just look no end to it russian wenches by heaven so they are 
in how comfortably settled themselves again as at the church in khamóvniki a wave of 
general curiosity bore all the prisoners forward onto the road and pierre thanks to his 
stature saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their curiosity in three 
carriages involved among the munition carts closely squeezed together sat women with rouged faces dressed 
in glaring colors who were shouting something in shrill voices from the moment pierre had 
recognized the appearance of the mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful 
neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the 
burned ruins of moscow all that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression on if 
his soul making ready for a hard struggle refused to receive impressions that might weaken 
it the vehicles drove by behind them came more carts soldiers wagons soldiers gun carriages 
carriages soldiers ammunition carts more soldiers and now and then women pierre did not see 
the people as individuals but saw their movement all these people and horses seemed driven 
forward by some invisible power during the hour pierre watched them they all came flowing 
from the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly they 
all jostled one another began to grow angry and to fight white teeth gleamed brows 
frowned ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side and all the 
faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck pierre that 
morning on the face when the drums were beating it was not till nearly evening 
that the officer commanding the escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced 
his way in among the baggage trains and the prisoners hemmed in on all sides 
emerged onto the kalúga road they marched very quickly without resting and halted only when 
the sun began to set the baggage carts drew up close together and the men 
began to prepare for their rest they all appeared angry and dissatisfied for a long 
time oaths angry shouts and fighting could be heard from all sides a carriage that 
followed the escort ran into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it 
with its pole several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides some beat the 
carriage horses on their heads turning them aside others fought among themselves and pierre saw 
that one german was badly wounded on the head by a sword it seemed that 
all these men now that they had stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of 
the autumn evening experienced one and the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry 
and eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start once at a 
standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were 
going and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey during 
this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the 
start it was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their 
meat ration from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like 
personal spite against each of the prisoners in unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations 
this spite increased still more when on calling over the roll of prisoners it was 
found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one russian soldier who had pretended to 
suffer from colic had escaped pierre saw a frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelly for 
straying too far from the road and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten 
to court martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the russian to 
the noncommissioned excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk the officer replied 
that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind pierre felt that that fatal 
force which had crushed him during the executions but which he had not felt during 
his imprisonment now again controlled his existence it was terrible but he felt that in 
proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him there grew and strengthened 
in his soul a power of life independent of it he ate his supper of 
buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his comrades neither pierre nor any of the 
others spoke of what they had seen in moscow or of the roughness of their 
treatment by the french or of the order to shoot them which had been announced 
to them as if in reaction against the worsening of their position they were all 
particularly animated and gay they spoke of personal reminiscences of amusing scenes they had witnessed 
during the campaign and avoided all talk of their present situation the sun had set 
long since bright stars shone out here and there in the sky a red glow 
as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon and that 
vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray haze it grew light the evening was 
ending but the night had not yet come pierre got up and left his new 
companions crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where he had 
been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed he wanted to talk to them on 
the road he was stopped by a french sentinel who ordered him back pierre turned 
back not to his companions by the campfire but to an unharnessed cart where there 
was nobody tucking his legs under him and dropping his head he sat down on 
the cold ground by the wheel of the cart and remained motionless a long while 
sunk in thought suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad good natured 
laughter so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this 
strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean ha ha laughed pierre and he said aloud 
to himself soldier did not let me pass they took me and shut me up 
they hold me captive what me me my immortal soul ha ha ha ha ha 
ha and he laughed till tears started to his eyes a man got up and 
came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at all by himself pierre 
stopped laughing got up went farther away from the inquisitive man and looked around him 
the huge endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the 
voices of many men had grown quiet the red campfires were growing paler and dying 
down high up in the light sky hung the full moon forests and fields beyond 
the camp unseen before were now visible in the distance and farther still beyond those 
forests and fields the bright oscillating limitless distance lured one to itself pierre glanced up 
at the sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway depths all that is me 
all that is within me and it is all i thought pierre they caught all 
that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks he smiled and went 
and lay down to sleep beside his companions chapter xv in the early days of 
october another envoy came to kutúzov with a letter from napoleon proposing peace and falsely 
dated from moscow though napoleon was already not far from kutúzov on the old kalúga 
road kutúzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought 
by lauriston saying that there could be no question of peace soon after that a 
report was received from guerrilla detachment operating to the left of tarútino that troops of 
division had been seen at formínsk and that being separated from the rest of the 
french army they might easily be destroyed the soldiers and officers again demanded action generals 
on the staff excited by the memory of the easy victory at tarútino urged kutúzov 
to carry out suggestion kutúzov did not consider any offensive necessary the result was a 
compromise which was inevitable a small detachment was sent to formínsk to attack broussier by 
a strange coincidence this task which turned out to be a most difficult and important 
one was entrusted to same modest little dokhtúrov whom no one had described to us 
as drawing up plans of battles dashing about in front of regiments showering crosses on 
batteries and so on and who was thought to be and was spoken of as 
undecided and whom we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the 
russo french wars from austerlitz to the year 1813 at austerlitz he remained last at 
the augezd dam rallying the regiments saving what was possible when all were flying and 
perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard ill with fever 
he went to smolénsk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against whole army 
in smolénsk at the malákhov gate he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of 
fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the smolénsk held out all day 
long at the battle of borodinó when bagratión was killed and nine tenths of the 
men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the french artillery 
fire was directed against it the man sent there was this same irresolute and undiscerning 
hastening to rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first and 
the quiet little dokhtúrov rode thither and borodinó became the greatest glory of the russian 
army many heroes have been described to us in verse and prose but of dokhtúrov 
scarcely a word has been said it was dokhtúrov again whom they sent to formínsk 
and from there to málo yaroslávets the place where the last battle with the french 
was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army began and we are 
told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign but of dokhtúrov 
nothing or very little is said and that dubiously and this silence about dokhtúrov is 
the clearest testimony to his merit it is natural for a man who does not 
understand the workings of a machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into 
it by chance and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is 
its most important part the man who does not understand the construction of the machine 
cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one of the most 
essential parts of the machine and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the 
working on the tenth of october when dokhtúrov had gone halfway to formínsk and stopped 
at the village of aristóvo preparing faithfully to execute the orders he had received the 
whole french army having in its convulsive movement reached position apparently in order to give 
without any reason turned off to the left onto the new kalúga road and began 
to enter formínsk where only broussier had been till then at that time dokhtúrov had 
under his command besides detachment the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and seslávin on 
the evening of october 11 seslávin came to the aristóvo headquarters with a french guardsman 
he had captured the prisoner said that the troops that had entered formínsk that day 
were the vanguard of the whole army that napoleon was there and the whole army 
had left moscow four days previously that same evening a house serf who had come 
from bórovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town some cossacks of 
detachment reported having sighted the french guards marching along the road to bórovsk from all 
these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a single division 
there was now the whole french army marching from moscow in an unexpected the kalúga 
road dokhtúrov was unwilling to undertake any action as it was not clear to him 
now what he ought to do he had been ordered to attack formínsk but only 
broussier had been there at that time and now the whole french army was there 
ermólov wished to act on his own judgment but dokhtúrov insisted that he must have 
instructions so it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff for this purpose 
a capable officer bolkhovítinov was chosen who was to explain the whole affair by word 
of mouth besides delivering a written report toward midnight bolkhovítinov having received the dispatch and 
verbal instructions galloped off to the general staff accompanied by a cossack with spare horses 
chapter xvi it was a warm dark autumn night it had been raining for four 
days having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half 
over a sticky muddy road bolkhovítinov reached litashëvka after one at night dismounting at a 
cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard general staff and throwing down his reins 
he entered a dark passage general on duty quick very important said he to someone 
who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage has been very unwell since 
the evening and this is the third night he has not slept said the orderly 
pleadingly in a whisper should wake the captain first this is very important from general 
dokhtúrov said bolkhovítinov entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the 
dark the orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody honor your honor 
a courier that from whom came a sleepy voice dokhtúrov and from alexéy petróvich napoleon 
is at formínsk said bolkhovítinov unable to see in the dark who was speaking but 
guessing by the voice that it was not konovnítsyn the man who had wakened yawned 
and stretched himself like waking him he said fumbling for something is very ill perhaps 
this is only a rumor is the dispatch said bolkhovítinov orders are to give it 
at once to the general on duty a moment light a candle you damned rascal 
where do you always hide it said the voice of the man who was stretching 
himself to the orderly this was shcherbínin adjutant found it found it he added the 
orderly was striking a light and shcherbínin was fumbling for something on the candlestick the 
nasty beasts said he with disgust by the light of the sparks bolkhovítinov saw youthful 
face as he held the candle and the face of another man who was still 
asleep this was konovnítsyn when the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder 
burned up first blue and then red shcherbínin lit the tallow candle from the candlestick 
of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away and looked at 
the messenger bolkhovítinov was bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by 
wiping it with his sleeve gave the report inquired shcherbínin taking the envelope news is 
reliable said bolkhovítinov cossacks and the scouts all say the same thing nothing to be 
done have to wake him said shcherbínin rising and going up to the man in 
the nightcap who lay covered by a greatcoat petróvich said he konovnítsyn did not stir 
the general staff he said with a smile knowing that those words would be sure 
to arouse him and in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once 
on handsome resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever there still remained for an instant 
a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs but then he suddenly started and his 
face assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance what is it from whom he asked 
immediately but without hurry blinking at the light while listening to the report konovnítsyn broke 
the seal and read the dispatch hardly had he done so before he lowered his 
legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his boots 
then he took off his nightcap combed his hair over his temples and donned his 
cap you get here quickly let us go to his highness konovnítsyn had understood at 
once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be 
lost he did not consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad 
that did not interest him he regarded the whole business of the war not with 
his intelligence or his reason but by something else there was within him a deep 
unexpressed conviction that all would be well but that one must not trust to this 
and still less speak about it but must only attend to own work and he 
did his work giving his whole strength to the task peter petróvich konovnítsyn like dokhtúrov 
seems to have been included merely for sake in the list of the so called 
heroes of barclays raévskis ermólovs plátovs and milorádoviches like dokhtúrov he had the reputation of 
being a man of very limited capacity and information and like dokhtúrov he never made 
plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult since his 
appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open giving orders 
that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up in battle he was always 
under fire so that kutúzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to 
the front and like dokhtúrov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that without clatter 
or noise constitute the most essential part of the machine coming out of the hut 
into the damp dark night konovnítsyn from an increased pain in his head and partly 
at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him of how all that nest of influential 
men on the staff would be stirred up by this news especially bennigsen who ever 
since tarútino had been at daggers drawn with kutúzov and how they would make suggestions 
quarrel issue orders and rescind them and this premonition was disagreeable to him though he 
knew it could not be helped and in fact toll to whom he went to 
communicate the news immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters 
until konovnítsyn who listened in weary silence reminded him that they must go to see 
his highness chapter xvii kutúzov like all old people did not sleep much at night 
he often fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime but at night lying on his bed 
without undressing he generally remained awake thinking so he lay now on his bed supporting 
his large heavy scarred head on his plump hand with his one eye open meditating 
and peering into the darkness since bennigsen who corresponded with the emperor and had more 
influence than anyone else on the staff had begun to avoid him kutúzov was more 
at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take 
part in useless aggressive movements the lesson of the tarútino battle and of the day 
before it which kutúzov remembered with pain must he thought have some effect on others 
too must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive patience and time 
are my warriors my champions thought kutúzov he knew that an apple should not be 
plucked while it is green it will fall of itself when ripe but if picked 
unripe the apple is spoiled the tree is harmed and your teeth are set on 
edge like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded and wounded as 
only the whole strength of russia could have wounded it but whether it was mortally 
wounded or not was still an undecided question now by the fact of lauriston and 
barthélemi having been sent and by the reports of the guerrillas kutúzov was almost sure 
that the wound was mortal but he needed further proofs and it was necessary to 
wait want to run to see how they have wounded it wait and we shall 
see continual maneuvers continual advances thought he for only to distinguish themselves as if fighting 
were fun they are like children from whom one get any sensible account of what 
has happened because they all want to show how well they can fight but not 
what is needed now what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me it seems to 
them that when they have thought of two or three he remembered the general plan 
sent him from petersburg have foreseen everything but the contingencies are endless the undecided question 
as to whether the wound inflicted at borodinó was mortal or not had hung over 
head for a whole month on the one hand the french had occupied moscow on 
the other kutúzov felt assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which 
he and all the russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal but 
in any case proofs were needed he had waited a whole month for them and 
grew more impatient the longer he waited lying on his bed during those sleepless nights 
he did just what he reproached those younger generals for doing he imagined all sorts 
of possible contingencies just like the younger men but with this difference that he saw 
thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them the longer 
he thought the more contingencies presented themselves he imagined all sorts of movements of the 
napoleonic army as a whole or in petersburg or against him or to outflank him 
he thought too of the possibility which he feared most of all that napoleon might 
fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscow awaiting him kutúzov even imagined 
that army might turn back through medýn and yukhnóv but the one thing he could 
not foresee was what insane convulsive stampede of army during its first eleven days after 
leaving moscow a stampede which made possible what kutúzov had not yet even dared to 
think complete extermination of the french report about division the reports of distress in army 
rumors of preparations for leaving moscow all confirmed the supposition that the french army was 
beaten and preparing for flight but these were only suppositions which seemed important to the 
younger men but not to kutúzov with his sixty experience he knew what value to 
attach to rumors knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news 
so that it appears to confirm what they desire and he knew how readily in 
such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary and the more he desired 
it the less he allowed himself to believe it this question absorbed all his mental 
powers all else was to him only customary routine to such customary routine belonged his 
conversations with the staff the letters he wrote from tarútino to madame de staël the 
reading of novels the distribution of awards his correspondence with petersburg and so on but 
the destruction of the french which he alone foresaw was his one desire on the 
night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on his arm and thinking of 
that there was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of 
toll konovnítsyn and bolkhovítinov there come in come in what news the field marshal called 
out to them while a footman was lighting a candle toll communicated the substance of 
the news brought it asked kutúzov with a look which when the candle was lit 
struck toll by its cold severity can be no doubt about it your highness him 
in call him here kutúzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed 
and his big paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him he screwed 
up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully as if wishing to read 
in his face what preoccupied his own mind me tell me friend said he to 
bolkhovítinov in his low aged voice as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open 
on his chest what news have you brought me eh that napoleon has left moscow 
are you sure eh bolkhovítinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he 
had been told to report quicker quicker torture me kutúzov interrupted him bolkhovítinov told him 
everything and was then silent awaiting instructions toll was beginning to say something but kutúzov 
checked him he tried to say something but his face suddenly puckered and wrinkled he 
waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side of the room to 
the corner darkened by the icons that hung there lord my creator thou has heard 
our prayer said he in a tremulous voice with folded hands is saved i thank 
thee o lord and he wept chapter xviii from the time he received this news 
to the end of the campaign all activity was directed toward restraining his troops by 
authority by guile and by entreaty from useless attacks maneuvers or encounters with the perishing 
enemy dokhtúrov went to málo yaroslávets but kutúzov lingered with the main army and gave 
orders for the evacuation of retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite possible everywhere 
kutúzov retreated but the enemy without waiting for his retreat fled in the opposite direction 
historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at tarútino and málo yaroslávets and make conjectures 
as to what would have happened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the 
rich southern provinces but not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from 
advancing into those southern provinces for the russian army did not bar his way the 
historians forget that nothing could have saved his army for then already it bore within 
itself the germs of inevitable ruin how could that had found abundant supplies in moscow 
and had trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them and on arriving at smolénsk had 
looted provisions instead of storing could that army recuperate in kalúga province which was inhabited 
by russians such as those who lived in moscow and where fire had the same 
property of consuming what was set ablaze that army could not recover anywhere since the 
battle of borodinó and the pillage of moscow it had borne within itself as it 
were the chemical elements of dissolution the members of what had once been an himself 
and all his soldiers fled without knowing whither each concerned only to make his escape 
as quickly as possible from this position of the hopelessness of which they were all 
more or less vaguely conscious so it came about that at the council at málo 
yaroslávets when the generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions all mouths were closed 
by the opinion uttered by the simple minded soldier mouton who speaking last said what 
they all felt that the one thing needful was to get away as quickly as 
possible and no one not even napoleon could say anything against that truth which they 
all recognized but though they all realized that it was necessary to get away there 
still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee an external shock 
was needed to overcome that shame and this shock came in due time it was 
what the french called hourra de the day after the council at málo yaroslávets napoleon 
rode out early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite 
of marshals and an escort on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene 
of the previous and of the impending battle some cossacks on the prowl for booty 
fell in with the emperor and very nearly captured him if the cossacks did not 
capture napoleon then what saved him was the very thing that was destroying the french 
army the booty on which the cossacks fell here as at tarútino they went after 
plunder leaving the men disregarding napoleon they rushed after the plunder and napoleon managed to 
escape when les enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor himself in 
the midst of his army it was clear that there was nothing for it but 
to fly as fast as possible along the nearest familiar road napoleon with his forty 
year old stomach understood that hint not feeling his former agility and boldness and under 
the influence of the fright the cossacks had given him he at once agreed with 
mouton and issued the historians tell retreat by the smolénsk road that napoleon agreed with 
mouton and that the army retreated does not prove that napoleon caused it to retreat 
but that the forces which influenced the whole army and directed it along the mozháysk 
that is the smolénsk road acted simultaneously on him also chapter xix a man in 
motion always devises an aim for that motion to be able to go a thousand 
miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end of those thousand 
miles one must have the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to 
move the promised land for the french during their advance had been moscow during their 
retreat it was their native land but that native land was too far off and 
for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside his 
final goal and to say to himself i shall get to a place twenty five 
miles off where i shall rest and spend the night and during the first journey 
that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires and 
the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd for the 
french retreating along the old smolénsk road the final native too remote and their immediate 
goal was smolénsk toward which all their desires and hopes enormously intensified in the mass 
urged them on it was not that they knew that much food and fresh troops 
awaited them in smolénsk nor that they were told so on the contrary their superior 
officers and napoleon himself knew that provisions were scarce there but because this alone could 
give them strength to move on and endure their present privations so both those who 
knew and those who did not know deceived themselves and pushed on to smolénsk as 
to a promised land coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy 
and unheard of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on besides the common impulse 
which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass and supplied them with a 
certain energy there was another cause binding them great numbers as with the physical law 
of gravity their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself in their hundreds 
of thousands they moved like a whole nation each of them desired nothing more than 
to give himself up as a prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery 
but on the one hand the force of this common attraction to smolénsk their goal 
drew each of them in the same direction on the other hand an army corps 
could not surrender to a company and though the french availed themselves of every convenient 
opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent pretext such pretexts did 
not always occur their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of 
that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the russians to stop 
this movement to which the french were directing all their energies beyond a certain limit 
no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of decomposition a lump of 
snow cannot be melted instantaneously there is a certain limit of time in less than 
which no amount of heat can melt the snow on the contrary the greater the 
heat the more solidified the remaining snow becomes of the russian commanders kutúzov alone understood 
this when the flight of the french army along the smolénsk road became well defined 
what konovnítsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of october began to occur 
the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves to cut off to seize to capture 
and to overthrow the french and all clamored for action kutúzov alone used all his 
power and such power is very limited in the case of any commander in chief 
to prevent an attack he could not tell them what we say now fight why 
block the road losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches what is the 
use of that when a third of their army has melted away on the road 
from moscow to vyázma without any battle but drawing from his aged wisdom what they 
could understand he told them of the golden bridge and they laughed at and slandered 
him flinging themselves on rending and exulting over the dying beast ermólov milorádovich plátov and 
others in proximity to the french near vyázma could not resist their desire to cut 
off and break up two french corps and by way of reporting their intention to 
kutúzov they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope and try as 
kutúzov might to restrain the troops our men attacked trying to bar the road infantry 
regiments we are told advanced to the attack with music and with drums beating and 
killed and lost thousands of men but they did not cut off or overthrow anybody 
and the french army closing up more firmly at the danger continued while steadily melting 
away to pursue its fatal path to smolénsk book fourteen 1812 chapter i the battle 
of borodinó with the occupation of moscow that followed it and the flight of the 
french without further conflicts is one of the most instructive phenomena in history all historians 
agree that the external activity of states and nations in their conflicts with one another 
is expressed in wars and that as a direct result of greater or less success 
in war the political strength of states and nations increases or decreases strange as may 
be the historical account of how some king or emperor having quarreled with another collects 
an army fights his army gains a victory by killing three five or ten thousand 
men and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions all the facts 
of history as far as we know it confirm the truth of the statement that 
the greater or lesser success of one army against another is the cause or at 
least an essential indication of an increase or decrease in the strength of the though 
it is unintelligible why the defeat of an hundredth part of a oblige that whole 
nation to submit an army gains a victory and at once the rights of the 
conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated an army has suffered defeat 
and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the 
reverse and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated so 
according to history it has been found from the most ancient times and so it 
is to our own day all wars serve to confirm this rule in proportion to 
the defeat of the austrian army austria loses its rights and the rights and the 
strength of france increase the victories of the french at jena and auerstädt destroy the 
independent existence of prussia but then in 1812 the french gain a victory near moscow 
moscow is taken and after that with no further battles it is not russia that 
ceases to exist but the french army of six hundred thousand and then napoleonic france 
itself to strain the facts to fit the rules of history to say that the 
field of battle at borodinó remained in the hands of the russians or that after 
moscow there were other battles that destroyed army is impossible after the french victory at 
borodinó there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious yet the 
french army ceased to exist what does this mean if it were an example taken 
from the history of china we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon 
which is the usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards if the matter 
concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part we 
might treat it as an exception but this event occurred before our eyes and for 
them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland and it 
happened in the greatest of all known wars the period of the campaign of 1812 
from the battle of borodinó to the expulsion of the french proved that the winning 
of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication 
of conquest it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not 
in the conquerors nor even in armies and battles but in something else the french 
historians describing the condition of the french army before it left moscow affirm that all 
was in order in the grand army except the cavalry the artillery and the was 
no forage for the horses or the cattle that was a misfortune no one could 
remedy for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the french 
have it the victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants karp 
and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow drove in their carts to pillage 
the town and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings and the whole 
innumerable multitude of such peasants did not bring their hay to moscow for the high 
price offered them but burned it instead let us imagine two men who have come 
out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art 
of fencing the fencing has gone on for some time suddenly one of the combatants 
feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life 
throws down his rapier and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to 
brandish it then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best 
and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by traditions 
of chivalry and desiring to conceal the facts of the case insisted that he had 
gained his victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art one can 
imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel the 
fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the french army 
his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the russian 
people those who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are 
the historians who have described the event after the burning of smolénsk a war began 
which did not follow any previous traditions of war the burning of towns and villages 
the retreats after battles the blow dealt at borodinó and the renewed retreat the burning 
of moscow the capture of marauders the seizure of transports and the guerrilla war were 
all departures from the rules napoleon felt this and from the time he took up 
the correct fencing attitude in moscow and instead of his rapier saw a cudgel raised 
above his head he did not cease to complain to kutúzov and to the emperor 
alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the if there were 
any rules for killing people in spite of the complaints of the french as to 
the nonobservance of the rules in spite of the fact that to some highly placed 
russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume 
a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules and to make 
an adroit thrust en prime and so cudgel of the war was lifted with all 
its menacing and majestic strength and without consulting tastes or rules and regardless of anything 
else it rose and fell with stupid simplicity but consistently and belabored the french till 
the whole invasion had perished and it is well for a people who do the 
french did in according to all the rules of art and presenting the hilt of 
their rapier gracefully and politely hand it to their magnanimous conqueror but at the moment 
of trial without asking what rules others have adopted in similar cases simply and easily 
pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the 
feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and 
compassion chapter ii one of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so called 
laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed together in a 
mass such action always occurs in wars that take on a national character in such 
actions instead of two crowds opposing each other the men disperse attack singly run away 
when attacked by stronger forces but again attack when opportunity offers this was done by 
the guerrillas in spain by the mountain tribes in the caucasus and by the russians 
in 1812 people have called this kind of war and assume that by so calling 
it they have explained its meaning but such a war does not fit in under 
any rule and is directly opposed to a well known rule of tactics which is 
accepted as infallible that rule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order 
to be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict guerrilla war always successful 
as history shows directly infringes that rule this contradiction arises from the fact that military 
science assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers military science 
says that the more troops the greater the strength les gros bataillons ont toujours raison 
large battalions are always victorious for military science to say this is like defining momentum 
in mechanics by reference to the mass only stating that momenta are equal or unequal 
to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal momentum quantity of 
motion is the product of mass and velocity in military affairs the strength of an 
army is the product of its mass and some unknown x military science seeing in 
history innumerable instances of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide 
with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones obscurely admits the existence of 
this unknown factor and tries to discover in a geometric formation now in the equipment 
employed now and most usually in the genius of the commanders but the assignment of 
these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic 
facts yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to gratify the 
of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by commanders in order to find 
this unknown quantity that unknown quantity is the spirit of the army that is to 
say the greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the 
men composing an army quite independently of whether they are or are not fighting under 
the command of a genius in three line formation with cudgels or with rifles that 
repeat thirty times a minute men who want to fight will always put themselves in 
the most advantageous conditions for fighting the spirit of an army is the factor which 
multiplied by the mass gives the resulting force to define and express the significance of 
this unknown spirit of an a problem for science this problem is only solvable if 
we cease arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that 
force becomes as the commands of the general the equipment employed and so these for 
the real significance of the factor and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its 
entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger only 
then expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor 
can we hope to define the unknown ten men battalions or divisions fighting fifteen men 
battalions or divisions is kill or take the others while themselves losing four so that 
on the one side four and on the other fifteen were lost consequently the four 
were equal to the fifteen and therefore 4x 15y consequently x y 15 4 this 
equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a 
ratio between two unknowns and by bringing variously selected historic units battles campaigns periods of 
war into such equations a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws 
should exist and might be discovered the tactical rule that an army should act in 
masses when attacking and in smaller groups in retreat unconsciously confirms the truth that the 
strength of an army depends on its spirit to lead men forward under fire more 
discipline obtainable only by movement in masses is needed than is needed to resist attacks 
but this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army continually proves 
incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or 
fall in the spirit of the troops occurs as in all national wars the french 
retreating in according to tactics they should have separated into detachments to defend into a 
mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass held 
the army together the russians on the contrary ought according to tactics to have attacked 
in mass but in fact they split up into small units because their spirit had 
so risen that separate individuals without orders dealt blows at the french without needing any 
compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers chapter iii the so 
called partisan war began with the entry of the french into smolénsk before partisan warfare 
had been officially recognized by the government thousands of enemy stragglers marauders and foragers had 
been destroyed by the cossacks and the peasants who killed them off as instinctively as 
dogs worry a stray mad dog to death denís davýdov with his russian instinct was 
the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules 
of military science destroyed the french and to him belongs the credit for taking the 
first step toward regularizing this method of warfare on august 24 first partisan detachment was 
formed and then others were recognized the further the campaign progressed the more numerous these 
detachments became the irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal they gathered the fallen leaves that 
dropped of themselves from that withered french sometimes shook that tree itself by october when 
the french were fleeing toward smolénsk there were hundreds of such companies of various sizes 
and characters there were some that adopted all the army methods and had infantry artillery 
staffs and the comforts of life others consisted solely of cossack cavalry there were also 
small scratch groups of foot and horse and groups of peasants and landowners that remained 
unknown a sacristan commanded one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course of 
a month and there was vasílisa the wife of a village elder who slew hundreds 
of the french the partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of 
october its first period had passed when the partisans themselves amazed at their own boldness 
feared every minute to be surrounded and captured by the french and hid in the 
forests without unsaddling hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued by the 
end of october this kind of warfare had taken definite shape it had become clear 
to all what could be ventured against the french and what could not now only 
the commanders of detachments with staffs and moving according to rules at a distance from 
the french still regarded many things as impossible the small bands that had started their 
activities long before and had already observed the french closely considered things possible which the 
commanders of the big detachments did not dare to contemplate the cossacks and peasants who 
crept in among the french now considered everything possible on october 22 denísov who was 
one of the irregulars was with his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm 
since early morning he and his party had been on the move all day long 
he had been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large french convoy 
of cavalry baggage and russian prisoners separated from the rest of the army was learned 
from spies and moving under a strong escort to smolénsk besides denísov and dólokhov who 
also led a small party and moved in vicinity the commanders of some large divisions 
with staffs also knew of this convoy and as denísov expressed it were sharpening their 
teeth for it two of the commanders of large a pole and the other a 
invitations to denísov almost simultaneously requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack 
the convoy bwother i have gwown mustaches myself said denísov on reading these documents and 
he wrote to the german that despite his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant 
and renowned a general he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under 
the command of the polish general to the polish general he replied to the same 
effect informing him that he was already under the command of the german having arranged 
matters thus denísov and dólokhov intended without reporting matters to the higher command to attack 
and seize that convoy with their own small forces on october 22 it was moving 
from the village of mikúlino to that of shámshevo to the left of the road 
between mikúlino and shámshevo there were large forests extending in some places up to the 
road itself though in others a mile or more back from it through these forests 
denísov and his party rode all day sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes 
coming to the very edge but never losing sight of the moving french that morning 
cossacks of party had seized and carried off into the forest two wagons loaded with 
cavalry saddles which had stuck in the mud not far from mikúlino where the forest 
ran close to the road since then and until evening the party had watched the 
movements of the french without attacking it was necessary to let the french reach shámshevo 
quietly without alarming them and then after joining dólokhov who was to come that evening 
to a consultation at a hut in the forest less than a mile from shámshevo 
to surprise the french at dawn falling like an avalanche on their heads from two 
sides and rout and capture them all at one blow in their rear more than 
a mile from mikúlino where the forest came right up to the road six cossacks 
were posted to report if any fresh columns of french should show themselves beyond shámshevo 
dólokhov was to observe the road in the same way to find out at what 
distance there were other french troops they reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men 
denísov had two hundred and dólokhov might have as many more but the disparity of 
numbers did not deter denísov all that he now wanted to know was what troops 
these were and to learn that he had to capture a is a man from 
the enemy column that attack on the wagons had been made so hastily that the 
frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed only a little drummer boy had been 
taken alive and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about 
the troops in that column denísov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for 
fear of putting the whole column on the alert so he sent tíkhon shcherbáty a 
peasant of his party to shámshevo to try and seize at least one of the 
french quartermasters who had been sent on in advance chapter iv it was a warm 
rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water 
at times a sort of mist descended and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down 
denísov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down 
was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides like his horse which turned its 
head and laid its ears back he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously 
before him his thin face with its short thick black beard looked angry beside denísov 
rode an esaul fellow worker also in felt cloak and sheepskin cap and riding a 
large sleek don horse a captain of cossacks esaul lováyski the third was a tall 
man as straight as an arrow pale faced fair haired with narrow light eyes and 
with calm self satisfaction in his face and bearing though it was impossible to say 
in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first glance at 
the esaul and denísov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was 
a man mounted on a horse while looking at the esaul one saw that he 
was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not 
a man who had mounted a horse but a man who was one with his 
horse a being consequently possessed of twofold strength a little ahead of them walked a 
peasant guide wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white 
knitted cap a little behind on a poor small lean kirghíz mount with an enormous 
tail and mane and a bleeding mouth rode a young officer in a blue french 
overcoat beside him rode an hussar with a boy in a tattered french uniform and 
blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse the boy held on to 
the hussar with cold red hands and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise 
this was the french drummer boy captured that morning behind them along the narrow sodden 
cut up forest road came hussars in threes and fours and then cossacks some in 
felt cloaks some in french greatcoats and some with horsecloths over their heads the horses 
being drenched by the rain all looked black whether chestnut or bay their necks with 
their wet close clinging manes looked strangely thin steam rose from them clothes saddles reins 
were all wet slippery and sodden like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed 
the road the men sat huddled up trying not to stir so as to warm 
the water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold water 
that was leaking in under their seats their knees and at the back of their 
necks in the midst of the outspread line of cossacks two wagons drawn by french 
horses and by saddled cossack horses that had been hitched on in front rumbled over 
the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts 
horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped his knee against 
a tree the devil exclaimed denísov angrily and showing his teeth he struck his horse 
three times with his whip splashing himself and his comrades with mud denísov was out 
of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger none of them had 
eaten anything since morning and yet more because he still had no news from dólokhov 
and the man sent to capture a had not returned hardly be another such chance 
to fall on a transport as today too risky to attack them by oneself and 
if we put it off till another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will 
snatch the prey from under our noses thought denísov continually peering forward hoping to see 
a messenger from dólokhov on coming to a path in the forest along which he 
could see far to the right denísov stopped someone coming said he the esaul looked 
in the direction denísov indicated are two an officer and a cossack but it is 
not presupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself said the esaul who was fond 
of using words the cossacks did not know the approaching riders having descended a decline 
were no longer visible but they reappeared a few minutes later in front at a 
weary gallop and using his leather whip rode an officer disheveled and drenched whose trousers 
had worked up to above his knees behind him standing in the stirrups trotted a 
cossack the officer a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry 
eyes galloped up to denísov and handed him a sodden envelope the general said the 
officer excuse its not being quite dry denísov frowning took the envelope and opened it 
they kept telling us dangerous dangerous said the officer addressing the esaul while denísov was 
reading the dispatch komaróv and pointed to the prepared we have each of us two 
pistols but this he asked noticing the french drummer boy prisoner already been in action 
may i speak to him pétya exclaimed denísov having run through the dispatch you say 
who you were and turning with a smile he held out his hand to the 
lad the officer was pétya rostóv all the way pétya had been preparing himself to 
behave with denísov as befitted a grown up man and an hinting at their previous 
acquaintance but as soon as denísov smiled at him pétya brightened up blushed with pleasure 
forgot the official manner he had been rehearsing and began telling him how he had 
already been in a battle near vyázma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself 
there i am glad to see you denísov interrupted him and his face again assumed 
its anxious expression feoklítych said he to the esaul is again fwom that german you 
know indicated serving under him and denísov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered 
was a repetition of the german demand that he should join forces with him for 
an attack on the transport we take it tomowwow snatch it fwom under our noses 
he added while denísov was talking to the esaul by cold tone and supposing that 
it was due to the condition of his tried to pull them down under his 
greatcoat so that no one should notice it while maintaining as martial an air as 
possible there be any orders your honor he asked denísov holding his hand at the 
salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for which he had prepared himself 
shall i remain with your honor denísov repeated thoughtfully can you stay till tomowwow please 
may i stay with you cried pétya just what did the genewal tell you to 
weturn at once asked denísov pétya blushed gave me no instructions i think i could 
he returned inquiringly all wight said denísov and turning to his men he directed a 
party to go on to the halting place arranged near the hut in the forest 
and told the officer on the kirghíz horse who performed the duties of an adjutant 
to go and find out where dólokhov was and whether he would come that evening 
denísov himself intended going with the esaul and pétya to the edge of the forest 
where it reached out to shámshevo to have a look at the part of the 
french bivouac they were to attack next day old fellow said he to the peasant 
guide us to shámshevo denísov pétya and the esaul accompanied by some cossacks and the 
hussar who had the prisoner rode to the left across a ravine to the edge 
of the forest chapter v the rain had stopped and only the mist was falling 
and drops from the trees denísov the esaul and pétya rode silently following the peasant 
in the knitted cap who stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving noiselessly in his 
bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves silently led them to the edge of 
the forest he ascended an incline stopped looked about him and advanced to where the 
screen of trees was less dense on reaching a large oak tree that had not 
yet shed its leaves he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them with his hand denísov 
and pétya rode up to him from the spot where the peasant was standing they 
could see the french immediately beyond the forest on a downward slope lay a field 
of spring rye to the right beyond a steep ravine was a small village and 
a house with a broken roof in the village in the house in the garden 
by the well by the pond over all the rising ground and all along the 
road uphill from the bridge leading to the village not more than five hundred yards 
away crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist their un russian shouting 
at their horses which were straining uphill with the carts and their calls to one 
another could be clearly heard the prisoner here said denísov in a low voice not 
taking his eyes off the french a cossack dismounted lifted the boy down and took 
him to denísov pointing to the french troops denísov asked him what these and those 
of them were the boy thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and lifting his 
eyebrows looked at denísov in affright but in spite of an evident desire to say 
all he knew gave confused answers merely assenting to everything denísov asked him denísov turned 
away from him frowning and addressed the esaul conveying his own conjectures to him pétya 
rapidly turning his head looked now at the drummer boy now at denísov now at 
the esaul and now at the french in the village and along the road trying 
not to miss anything of importance dólokhov comes or not we must seize it eh 
said denísov with a merry sparkle in his eyes is a very suitable spot said 
the esaul send the infantwy down by the swamps denísov continued cweep up to the 
garden wide up fwom there with the pointed to a spot in the forest beyond 
the i with my hussars fwom here and at the signal shot hollow is a 
swamp there said the esaul horses would sink we must ride round more to the 
left while they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from the 
low ground by the pond a puff of white smoke appeared then another and the 
sound of hundreds of seemingly merry french voices shouting together came up from the slope 
for a moment denísov and the esaul drew back they were so near that they 
thought they were the cause of the firing and shouting but the firing and shouting 
did not relate to them down below a man wearing something red was running through 
the marsh the french were evidently firing and shouting at him our tíkhon said the 
esaul it is it is wascal said denísov get away said the esaul screwing up 
his eyes the man whom they called tíkhon having run to the stream plunged in 
so that the water splashed in the air and having disappeared for an instant scrambled 
out on all fours all black with the wet and ran on the french who 
had been pursuing him stopped that said the esaul a beast said denísov with his 
former look of vexation has he been doing all this time is he asked pétya 
our plastún i sent him to capture a yes said pétya nodding at the first 
words denísov uttered as if he understood it all though he really did not understand 
anything of it tíkhon shcherbáty was one of the most indispensable men in their band 
he was a peasant from pokróvsk near the river gzhat when denísov had come to 
pokróvsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual summoned the village elder 
and asked him what he knew about the french the elder as though shielding himself 
had replied as all village elders did that he had neither seen nor heard anything 
of them but when denísov explained that his purpose was to kill the french and 
asked if no french had strayed that way the elder replied that some had really 
been at their village but that tíkhon shcherbáty was the only man who dealt with 
such matters denísov had tíkhon called and having praised him for his activity said a 
few words in the presence about loyalty to the tsar and the country and the 
hatred of the french that all sons of the fatherland should cherish do the french 
any harm said tíkhon evidently frightened by words only fooled about with the lads for 
fun you know we killed a score or so of orderers but we did no 
harm else next day when denísov had left pokróvsk having quite forgotten about this peasant 
it was reported to him that tíkhon had attached himself to their party and asked 
to be allowed to remain with it denísov gave orders to let him do so 
tíkhon who at first did rough work laying campfires fetching water flaying dead horses and 
so on soon showed a great liking and aptitude for partisan warfare at night he 
would go out for booty and always brought back french clothing and weapons and when 
told to would bring in french captives also denísov then relieved him from drudgery and 
began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled 
among the cossacks tíkhon did not like riding and always went on foot never lagging 
behind the cavalry he was armed with a musketoon which he carried rather as a 
joke a pike and an ax which latter he used as a wolf uses its 
teeth with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones tíkhon 
with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at length or holding the head of 
the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons in party he held a 
peculiar and exceptional position when anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be push a 
cart out of the mud with shoulders pull a horse out of a swamp by 
its tail skin it slink in among the french or walk more than thirty miles 
in a pointed laughingly at tíkhon hurt that as strong as a horse they said 
of him once a frenchman tíkhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him 
and shot him in the fleshy part of the back that wound which tíkhon treated 
only with internal and external applications of vodka was the subject of the liveliest jokes 
by the whole in which tíkhon readily joined mate never again gave you a twist 
the cossacks would banter him and tíkhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended to be 
angry and swore at the french with the funniest curses the only effect of this 
incident on tíkhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners he was 
the bravest and most useful man in the party no one found more opportunities for 
attacking no one captured or killed more frenchmen and consequently he was made the buffoon 
of all the cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role now he had been 
sent by denísov overnight to shámshevo to capture a but whether because he had not 
been content to take only one frenchman or because he had slept through the night 
he had crept by day into some bushes right among the french and as denísov 
had witnessed from above had been detected by them chapter vi after talking for some 
time with the esaul about next attack which now seeing how near they were to 
the french he seemed to have definitely decided on denísov turned his horse and rode 
back my lad go and get dwy he said to pétya as they approached the 
watchhouse denísov stopped peering into the forest among the trees a man with long legs 
and long swinging arms wearing a short jacket bast shoes and a kazán hat was 
approaching with long light steps he had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax 
stuck in his girdle when he espied denísov he hastily threw something into the bushes 
removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim and approached his commander it was tíkhon 
his wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with self satisfied merriment he 
lifted his head high and gazed at denísov as if repressing a laugh where did 
you disappear to inquired denísov did i disappear to i went to get frenchmen answered 
tíkhon boldly and hurriedly in a husky but melodious bass voice did you push yourself 
in there by daylight you ass well why you taken one i took one all 
right said tíkhon is he see i took him first thing at dawn tíkhon continued 
spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes took him into 
the forest then i see no good and think go and fetch a likelier one 
see what a just as i thought said denísov to the esaul you bwing that 
one was the good of bringing him tíkhon interrupted hastily and one have done for 
you as if i know what sort you want a bwute you are well went 
for another one tíkhon continued i crept like this through the wood and lay down 
he suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he 
had done it turned up and i grabbed him like this he jumped up quickly 
and lightly along to the colonel i said he starts yelling and suddenly there were 
four of them they rushed at me with their little swords so i went for 
them with my ax this way are you up to says i be with you 
shouted tíkhon waving his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest we 
saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the puddles said the 
esaul screwing up his glittering eyes pétya badly wanted to laugh but noticed that they 
all refrained from laughing he turned his eyes rapidly from face to the and unable 
to make out what it all meant play the fool said denísov coughing angrily you 
bwing the first one tíkhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with 
the other then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming foolish grin disclosing a 
gap where he had lost a tooth that was why he was called gap toothed 
denísov smiled and pétya burst into a peal of merry laughter in which tíkhon himself 
joined but he was a regular good for nothing said tíkhon clothes on stuff how 
could i bring him and so rude your honor why he says a son myself 
i go he says are a bwute said denísov wanted to question i questioned him 
said tíkhon said he know much are a lot of us he says all poor 
soldiers in name he says loud at them he says take them all tíkhon concluded 
looking cheerfully and resolutely into eyes give you a hundwed sharp teach you to play 
the fool said denísov severely why are you angry remonstrated tíkhon as if never seen 
your frenchmen only wait till it gets dark and fetch you any of them you 
if you like go said denísov and rode all the way to the watchhouse in 
silence and frowning angrily tíkhon followed behind and pétya heard the cossacks laughing with him 
and at him about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes when 
the fit of laughter that had seized him at words and smile had passed and 
pétya realized for a moment that this tíkhon had killed a man he felt uneasy 
he looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart 
but this uneasiness lasted only a moment he felt it necessary to hold his head 
higher to brace himself and to question the esaul with an air of importance about 
undertaking that he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself 
the officer who had been sent to inquire met denísov on the way with the 
news that dólokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him denísov at 
once cheered up and calling pétya to him said tell me about yourself chapter vii 
pétya having left his people after their departure from moscow joined his regiment and was 
soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a large guerrilla detachment from the time 
he received his commission and especially since he had joined the active army and taken 
part in the battle of vyázma pétya had been in a constant state of blissful 
excitement at being grown up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any 
chance to do something really heroic he was highly delighted with what he saw and 
experienced in the army but at the same time it always seemed to him that 
the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be 
and he was always in a hurry to get where he was not when on 
the twenty first of october his general expressed a wish to send somebody to detachment 
pétya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse but when 
dispatching him he recalled mad action at the battle of vyázma where instead of riding 
by the road to the place to which he had been sent he had galloped 
to the advanced line under the fire of the french and had there twice fired 
his pistol so now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever 
of that was why pétya had blushed and grown confused when denísov asked him whether 
he could stay before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest pétya had 
considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once but when he 
saw the french and saw tíkhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack 
that night he decided with the rapidity with which young people change their views that 
the general whom he had greatly respected till then was a rubbishy german that denísov 
was a hero the esaul a hero and tíkhon a hero too and that it 
would be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of difficulty it was 
already growing dusk when denísov pétya and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse in 
the twilight saddled horses could be seen and cossacks and hussars who had rigged up 
rough shelters in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the 
forest where the french could not see the smoke in the passage of the small 
watchhouse a cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton in the room three 
officers of band were converting a door into a tabletop pétya took off his wet 
clothes gave them to be dried and at once began helping the officers to fix 
up the dinner table in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread 
on it on the table were vodka a flask of rum white bread roast mutton 
and salt sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton with 
his hands down which the grease trickled pétya was in an ecstatic childish state of 
love for all men and consequently of confidence that others loved him in the same 
way then what do you think vasíli dmítrich said he to denísov all right my 
staying a day with you and not waiting for a reply he answered his own 
question see i was told to find i am finding out only do let me 
into the very into the chief i want a reward but i want pétya clenched 
his teeth and looked around throwing back his head and flourishing his arms the vewy 
chief denísov repeated with a smile please let me command something so that i may 
really command pétya went on would it be to you oh you want a knife 
he said turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton 
and he handed him his clasp knife the officer admired it keep it i have 
several like it said pétya blushing i was quite forgetting he suddenly cried have some 
raisins fine ones you know seedless ones we have a new sutler and he has 
such capital things i bought ten pounds i am used to something sweet would you 
like some and pétya ran out into the passage to his cossack and brought back 
some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins some gentlemen have some want a 
coffeepot you he asked the esaul bought a capital one from our sutler he has 
splendid things and very honest the chief thing be sure to send it to you 
or perhaps your flints are giving out or are worn happens sometimes you know i 
have brought some with me here they he showed a hundred flints i bought them 
very cheap please take as many as you want or all if you like then 
suddenly dismayed lest he had said too much pétya stopped and blushed he tried to 
remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish and running over the 
events of the day he remembered the french drummer boy capital for us here but 
what of him where have they put him have they fed him they hurt his 
feelings he thought but having caught himself saying too much about the flints he was 
now afraid to speak out might ask he thought say a boy himself and so 
he pities the boy show them tomorrow whether a boy will it seem odd if 
i ask pétya thought never mind and immediately blushing and looking anxiously at the officers 
to see if they appeared ironical he said i call in that boy who was 
taken prisoner and give him something to eat perhaps a poor little fellow said denísov 
who evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder him in his name is vincent bosse 
have him fetched call him said pétya yes call him a poor little fellow denísov 
repeated pétya was standing at the door when denísov said this he slipped in between 
the officers came close to denísov and said me kiss you dear old fellow oh 
how fine how splendid and having kissed denísov he ran out of the hut vincent 
pétya cried stopping outside the door do you want sir asked a voice in the 
darkness pétya replied that he wanted the french lad who had been captured that day 
vesénny said a cossack vincent the name had already been changed by the cossacks into 
vesénny vernal and into vesénya by the peasants and soldiers in both these adaptations the 
reference to spring vesná matched the impression made by the young lad is warming himself 
there by the bonfire ho vesénya vesénya laughing voices were heard calling to one another 
in the darkness a smart lad said an hussar standing near pétya gave him something 
to eat a while ago he was awfully hungry the sound of bare feet splashing 
through the mud was heard in the darkness and the drummer boy came to the 
door vous said pétya vous manger pas peur on ne vous fera pas de mal 
he added shyly and affectionately touching the hand entrez 2 you do you want something 
to eat be afraid they hurt you 2 in come in monsieur said the drummer 
boy in a trembling almost childish voice and he began scraping his dirty feet on 
the threshold you sir there were many things pétya wanted to say to the drummer 
boy but did not dare to he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage then 
in the darkness he took the hand and pressed it in come in he repeated 
in a gentle whisper what can i do for him he thought and opening the 
door he let the boy pass in first when the boy had entered the hut 
pétya sat down at a distance from him considering it beneath his dignity to pay 
attention to him but he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it 
would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy chapter viii the arrival of 
dólokhov diverted attention from the drummer boy to whom denísov had had some mutton and 
vodka given and whom he had had dressed in a russian coat so that he 
might be kept with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners pétya 
had heard in the army many stories of extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to 
the french so from the moment he entered the hut pétya did not take his 
eyes from him but braced himself up more and more and held his head high 
that he might not be unworthy even of such company appearance amazed pétya by its 
simplicity denísov wore a cossack coat had a beard had an icon of nicholas the 
wonder worker on his breast and his way of speaking and everything he did indicated 
his unusual position but dólokhov who in moscow had worn a persian costume had now 
the appearance of a most correct officer of the guards he was clean shaven and 
wore a padded coat with an order of st george at his buttonhole and a 
plain forage cap set straight on his head he took off his wet felt cloak 
in a corner of the room and without greeting anyone went up to denísov and 
began questioning him about the matter in hand denísov told him of the designs the 
large detachments had on the transport of the message pétya had brought and his own 
replies to both generals then he told him all he knew of the french detachment 
so but we must know what troops they are and their numbers said dólokhov will 
be necessary to go there we start the affair without knowing for certain how many 
there are i like to work accurately here one of these gentlemen like to ride 
over to the french camp with me i have brought a spare uniform i go 
with you cried pétya no need for you to go at all said denísov addressing 
dólokhov as for him i let him go on any account like that exclaimed pétya 
i go useless you must excuse me because because i shall go and all take 
me you he said turning to dólokhov not dólokhov answered absently scrutinizing the face of 
the french drummer boy you had that youngster with you long he asked denísov was 
taken today but he knows nothing keeping him with me and where do you put 
the others inquired dólokhov i send them away and take a weceipt for them shouted 
denísov suddenly flushing i say boldly that i have not a single life on my 
conscience would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to 
town under escort instead of speak the honor of a soldier kind of amiable talk 
would be suitable from this young count of sixteen said dólokhov with cold irony time 
for you to drop it not said anything i only say that certainly go with 
you said pétya shyly for you and me old fellow time to drop these amenities 
continued dólokhov as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated 
denísov why have you kept this lad he went on swaying his head you are 
sorry for him we know those of yours you send a hundred men away and 
thirty get there the rest either starve or get killed so it all the same 
not to send them the esaul screwing up his light colored eyes nodded approvingly not 
the point not going to discuss the matter i do not wish to take it 
on my conscience you say die all wight only not by my fault dólokhov began 
laughing has told them not to capture me these twenty times over but if they 
did catch me string me up to an aspen tree and with all your chivalry 
just the same he paused we must get to work tell the cossack to fetch 
my kit i have two french uniforms in it well are you coming with me 
he asked pétya yes yes certainly cried pétya blushing almost to tears and glancing at 
denísov while dólokhov had been disputing with denísov what should be done with prisoners pétya 
had once more felt awkward and restless but again he had no time to grasp 
fully what they were talking about grown up distinguished men think so it must be 
necessary and right thought he above all denísov must not dare to imagine that obey 
him and that he can order me about i will certainly go to the french 
camp with dólokhov if he can so can i and to all persuasions pétya replied 
that he too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow and that 
he never considered personal danger admit that if we know for sure how many of 
them there are hundreds of lives may depend on it while there are only two 
of us besides i want to go very much and certainly will go so hinder 
me said he will only make things worse chapter ix having put on french greatcoats 
and shakos pétya and dólokhov rode to the clearing from which denísov had reconnoitered the 
french camp and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow 
on reaching the bottom dólokhov told the cossacks accompanying him to await him there and 
rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge pétya his heart 
in his mouth with excitement rode by his side caught i be taken alive i 
have a pistol whispered he talk russian said dólokhov in a hurried whisper and at 
that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge vive and the click of 
a musket goes there the blood rushed to face and he grasped his pistol du 
6 me replied dólokhov neither hastening nor slackening his pace of the 6th regiment the 
black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge dólokhov reined in his horse and 
advanced at a walk donc le colonel gérard est ici he asked me is colonel 
gérard here repeated the sentinel barring the way and not replying un officier fait sa 
ronde les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot cried dólokhov suddenly flaring up and riding 
straight at the sentinel vous demande si le colonel est ici an officer is making 
his round sentinels ask him for the password i am asking you if the colonel 
is here and without waiting for an answer from the sentinel who had stepped aside 
dólokhov rode up the incline at a walk noticing the black outline of a man 
crossing the road dólokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were the 
man a soldier with a sack over his shoulder stopped came close up to horse 
touched it with his hand and explained simply and in a friendly way that the 
commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard 
of the farm as he called the house having ridden up the road on both 
sides of which french talk could be heard around the campfires dólokhov turned into the 
courtyard of the house having ridden in he dismounted and approached a big blazing campfire 
around which sat several men talking noisily something was boiling in a small cauldron at 
the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat 
lit up by the fire was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod 
a hard nut to crack said one of the officers who was sitting in the 
shadow at the other side of the fire make them get a move on those 
fellows said another laughing both fell silent peering out through the darkness at the sound 
of and steps as they advanced to the fire leading their horses messieurs said dólokhov 
loudly and clearly day gentlemen there was a stir among the officers in the shadow 
beyond the fire and one tall long necked officer walking round the fire came up 
to dólokhov that you clément he asked the devil but noticing his mistake he broke 
off short and with a frown greeted dólokhov as a stranger asking what he could 
do for him dólokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their 
regiment and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew anything of the 6th 
regiment none of them knew anything and pétya thought the officers were beginning to look 
at him and dólokhov with hostility and suspicion for some seconds all were silent you 
were counting on the evening soup you have come too late said a voice from 
behind the fire with a repressed laugh dólokhov replied that they were not hungry and 
must push on farther that night he handed the horses over to the soldier who 
was stirring the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the 
officer with the long neck that officer did not take his eyes from dólokhov and 
again asked to what regiment he belonged dólokhov as if he had not heard the 
question did not reply but lighting a short french pipe which he took from his 
pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe from 
cossacks brigands are everywhere replied an officer from behind the fire dólokhov remarked that the 
cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as his companion and himself probably they 
would not dare to attack large detachments he added inquiringly no one replied now come 
away pétya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk 
but dólokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began putting direct questions as to 
how many men there were in the battalion how many battalions and how many prisoners 
asking about the russian prisoners with that detachment dólokhov said horrid business dragging these corpses 
about with one it would be better to shoot such rabble and burst into loud 
laughter so strange that pétya thought the french would immediately detect their disguise and involuntarily 
took a step back from the campfire no one replied a word to laughter and 
a french officer whom they could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat rose 
and whispered something to a companion dólokhov got up and called to the soldier who 
was holding their horses they bring our horses or not thought pétya instinctively drawing nearer 
to dólokhov the horses were brought evening gentlemen said dólokhov pétya wished to say but 
could not utter a word the officers were whispering together dólokhov was a long time 
mounting his horse which would not stand still then he rode out of the yard 
at a footpace pétya rode beside him longing to look round to see whether or 
not the french were running after them but not daring to coming out onto the 
road dólokhov did not ride back across the open country but through the village at 
one spot he stopped and listened you hear he asked pétya recognized the sound of 
russian voices and saw the dark figures of russian prisoners round their campfires when they 
had descended to the bridge pétya and dólokhov rode past the sentinel who without saying 
a word paced morosely up and down it then they descended into the hollow where 
the cossacks awaited them now good by tell denísov the first shot at daybreak said 
dólokhov and was about to ride away but pétya seized hold of him he cried 
are such a hero oh how fine how splendid how i love you right all 
right said dólokhov but pétya did not let go of him and dólokhov saw through 
the gloom that pétya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him dólokhov kissed 
him laughed turned his horse and vanished into the darkness chapter x having returned to 
the hut pétya found denísov in the passage he was awaiting return in a state 
of agitation anxiety and self reproach for having let him go god he exclaimed thank 
god he repeated listening to rapturous account devil take you i slept because of you 
well thank god now lie down we can still get a nap before morning no 
said pétya want to sleep yet besides i know myself if i fall asleep finished 
and then i am used to not sleeping before a battle he sat awhile in 
the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what 
would happen next day then noticing that denísov was asleep he rose and went out 
of doors it was still quite dark outside the rain was over but drops were 
still falling from the trees near the hut the black shapes of the shanties and 
of horses tethered together could be seen behind the hut the dark shapes of the 
two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible and in the hollow the dying 
campfire gleamed red not all the cossacks and hussars were asleep here and there amid 
the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by could be 
heard low voices which seemed to be whispering pétya came out peered into the darkness 
and went up to the wagons someone was snoring under them and around them stood 
saddled horses munching their oats in the dark pétya recognized his own horse which he 
called though it was of ukranian breed and went up to it karabákh do some 
service tomorrow said he sniffing its nostrils and kissing it you asleep sir said a 
cossack who was sitting under a wagon ah that your name do you know i 
have only just come back been into the french camp and pétya gave the cossack 
a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object and why 
he considered it better to risk his life than to act anyhow you should get 
some sleep now said the cossack i am used to this said pétya say the 
flints in your pistols worn out i brought some with me you want any you 
can have some the cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer 
look at pétya i am accustomed to doing everything accurately said pétya fellows do things 
just anyhow without preparation and then sorry for it afterwards i like that so said 
the cossack yes another thing please my dear fellow will you sharpen my saber for 
me got bl pétya feared to tell a lie and the saber never had been 
sharpened you do it course i can likhachëv got up rummaged in his pack and 
soon pétya heard the warlike sound of steel on whetstone he climbed onto the wagon 
and sat on its edge the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon say 
are the lads asleep asked pétya are and some us and that boy oh thrown 
himself down there in the passage fast asleep after his fright he was that glad 
after that pétya remained silent for a long time listening to the sounds he heard 
footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared are you sharpening asked a man 
coming up to the wagon this saber right said the man whom pétya took to 
be an hussar the cup left here by the wheel the hussar took the cup 
must be daylight soon said he yawning and went away pétya ought to have known 
that he was in a forest with guerrilla band less than a mile from the 
road sitting on a wagon captured from the french beside which horses were tethered that 
under it likhachëv was sitting sharpening a saber for him that the big dark blotch 
to the right was the hut and the red blotch below to the left was 
the dying embers of a campfire that the man who had come for the cup 
was an hussar who wanted a drink but he neither knew nor waited to know 
anything of all this he was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality the 
big dark blotch might really be the hut or it might be a cavern leading 
to the very depths of the earth perhaps the red spot was a fire or 
it might be the eye of an enormous monster perhaps he was really sitting on 
a wagon but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a 
wagon but on a terribly high tower from which if he fell he would have 
to fall for a whole day or a whole month or go on falling and 
never reach the bottom perhaps it was just the cossack likhachëv who was sitting under 
the wagon but it might be the kindest bravest most wonderful most splendid man in 
the world whom no one knew of it might really have been that the hussar 
came for water and went back into the hollow but perhaps he had simply altogether 
and dissolved into nothingness nothing pétya could have seen now would have surprised him he 
was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible he looked up at the sky 
and the sky was a fairy realm like the earth it was clearing and over 
the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars sometimes 
it looked as if the clouds were passing and a clear black sky appeared sometimes 
it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed to be 
rising high high overhead and then it seemed to sink so low that one could 
touch it with hand eyes began to close and he swayed a little the trees 
were dripping quiet talking was heard the horses neighed and jostled one another someone snored 
zheg ozheg zheg hissed the saber against the whetstone and suddenly pétya heard an harmonious 
orchestra playing some unknown sweetly solemn hymn pétya was as musical as natásha and more 
so than nicholas but had never learned music or thought about it and so the 
melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive the 
music became more and more audible the melody grew and passed from one instrument to 
another and what was played was a pétya had not the least conception of what 
a fugue is each resembling a violin and now a horn but better and clearer 
than violin or its own part and before it had finished the melody merged with 
another instrument that began almost the same air and then with a third and a 
fourth and they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended now 
into solemn church music now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant that was in a 
dream pétya said to himself as he lurched forward in my ears but perhaps music 
of my own well go on my music now he closed his eyes and from 
all sides as if from a distance sounds fluttered grew into harmonies separated blended and 
again all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn this is delightful as much 
as i like and as i like said pétya to himself he tried to conduct 
that enormous orchestra softly softly die away and the sounds obeyed him fuller more joyful 
still more and more joyful and from an unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds voices 
join in ordered pétya and at first from afar he heard voices and then the 
voices grew in harmonious triumphant strength and pétya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe 
and joy with a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song the drip from the 
trees and the hissing of the saber zheg zheg and again the horses jostled one 
another and neighed not disturbing the choir but joining in it pétya did not know 
how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all the time wondered at his enjoyment and 
regretted that there was no one to share it he was awakened by kindly voice 
ready your honor you can split a frenchman in half with it pétya woke up 
getting light really getting light he exclaimed the horses that had previously been invisible could 
now be seen to their very tails and a watery light showed itself through the 
bare branches pétya shook himself jumped up took a ruble from his pocket and gave 
it to likhachëv then he flourished the saber tested it and sheathed it the cossacks 
were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths the commander said likhachëv denísov came 
out of the hut and having called pétya gave orders to get ready chapter xi 
the men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness tightened their saddle girths and 
formed companies denísov stood by the hut giving final orders the infantry of the detachment 
passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early 
dawn hundreds of feet splashing through the mud the esaul gave some orders to his 
men pétya held his horse by the bridle impatiently awaiting the order to mount his 
face having been bathed in cold water was all aglow and his eyes were particularly 
brilliant cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically is weady 
asked denísov the horses the horses were brought denísov was angry with the cossack because 
the saddle girths were too slack reproved him and mounted pétya put his foot in 
the stirrup his horse by habit made as if to nip his leg but pétya 
leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and turning to look at 
the hussars starting in the darkness behind him rode up to denísov dmítrich entrust me 
with some commission please for sake said he denísov seemed to have forgotten very existence 
he turned to glance at him ask one thing of you he said sternly obey 
me and not shove yourself forward anywhere he did not say another word to pétya 
but rode in silence all the way when they had come to the edge of 
the forest it was noticeably growing light over the field denísov talked in whispers with 
the esaul and the cossacks rode past pétya and denísov when they had all ridden 
by denísov touched his horse and rode down the hill slipping onto their haunches and 
sliding the horses descended with their riders into the ravine pétya rode beside denísov the 
pulsation of his body constantly increasing it was getting lighter and lighter but the mist 
still hid distant objects having reached the valley denísov looked back and nodded to a 
cossack beside him signal said he the cossack raised his arm and a shot rang 
out in an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard shouts came from 
various sides and then more shots at the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting 
pétya lashed his horse and loosening his rein galloped forward not heeding denísov who shouted 
at him it seemed to pétya that at the moment the shot was fired it 
suddenly became as bright as noon he galloped to the bridge cossacks were galloping along 
the road in front of him on the bridge he collided with a cossack who 
had fallen behind but he galloped on in front of him soldiers probably frenchmen were 
running from right to left across the road one of them fell in the mud 
under his feet cossacks were crowding about a hut busy with something from the midst 
of that crowd terrible screams arose pétya galloped up and the first thing he saw 
was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchman clutching the handle of a 
lance that had been aimed at him lads ours shouted pétya and giving rein to 
his excited horse he galloped forward along the village street he could hear shooting ahead 
of him cossacks hussars and ragged russian prisoners who had come running from both sides 
of the road were shouting something loudly and incoherently a gallant looking frenchman in a 
blue overcoat capless and with a frowning red face had been defending himself against the 
hussars when pétya galloped up the frenchman had already fallen late again flashed through mind 
and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be heard 
the shots came from the yard of the house he had visited the night before 
with dólokhov the french were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a 
garden thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the cossacks who crowded at the 
gateway through the smoke as he approached the gate pétya saw dólokhov whose face was 
of a pale greenish tint shouting to his men round wait for the infantry he 
exclaimed as pétya rode up to him hurrah ah ah shouted pétya and without pausing 
a moment galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the 
smoke was thickest a volley was heard and some bullets whistled past while others plashed 
against something the cossacks and dólokhov galloped after pétya into the gateway of the courtyard 
in the dense wavering smoke some of the french threw down their arms and ran 
out of the bushes to meet the cossacks while others ran down the hill toward 
the pond pétya was galloping along the courtyard but instead of holding the reins he 
waved both his arms about rapidly and strangely slipping farther and farther to one side 
in his saddle his horse having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in 
the morning light stopped suddenly and pétya fell heavily on to the wet ground the 
cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless 
a bullet had pierced his skull after speaking to the senior french officer who came 
out of the house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that 
they surrendered dólokhov dismounted and went up to pétya who lay motionless with outstretched arms 
for he said with a frown and went to the gate to meet denísov who 
was riding toward him cried denísov recognizing from a distance the unmistakably lifeless familiar to 
which body was lying for repeated dólokhov as if the utterance of these words afforded 
him pleasure and he went quickly up to the prisoners who were surrounded by cossacks 
who had hurried up take them he called out to denísov denísov did not reply 
he rode up to pétya dismounted and with trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained 
mud bespattered face which had already gone white am used to something sweet raisins fine 
ones take them all he recalled words and the cossacks looked round in surprise at 
the sound like the yelp of a dog with which denísov turned away walked to 
the wattle fence and seized hold of it among the russian prisoners rescued by denísov 
and dólokhov was pierre bezúkhov chapter xii during the whole of their march from moscow 
no fresh orders had been issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners 
among whom was pierre on the twenty second of october that party was no longer 
with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left moscow half the 
wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured 
by cossacks the other half had gone on ahead not one of those dismounted cavalrymen 
who had marched in front of the prisoners was left they had all disappeared the 
artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now 
replaced by marshal enormous baggage train convoyed by westphalians behind the prisoners came a cavalry 
baggage train from vyázma onwards the french army which had till then moved in three 
columns went on as a single group the symptoms of disorder that pierre had noticed 
at their first halting place after leaving moscow had now reached the utmost limit the 
road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead horses ragged men 
who had fallen behind from various regiments continually changed about now joining the moving column 
now again lagging behind it several times during the march false alarms had been given 
and the soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets fired and run headlong crushing 
one another but had afterwards reassembled and abused each other for their causeless panic these 
three groups traveling cavalry stores the convoy of prisoners and baggage constituted a separate and 
united whole though each of the groups was rapidly melting away of the artillery baggage 
train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons not more than sixty now 
remained the rest had been captured or left behind some of wagons also had been 
captured or abandoned three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from corps from 
the talk of the germans pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to 
that baggage train than to the prisoners and that one of their comrades a german 
soldier had been shot by the own order because a silver spoon belonging to the 
marshal had been found in his possession the group of prisoners had melted away most 
of all of the three hundred and thirty men who had set out from moscow 
fewer than a hundred now remained the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than 
even the cavalry saddles or baggage they understood that the saddles and spoon might be 
of some use but that cold and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard 
equally cold and hungry russians who froze and lagged behind on the road in which 
case the order was to shoot them was not merely incomprehensible but revolting and the 
escort as if afraid in the grievous condition they themselves were in of giving way 
to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still 
worse treated them with particular moroseness and severity at dorogobúzh while the soldiers of the 
convoy after locking the prisoners in a stable had gone off to pillage their own 
stores several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away but were 
recaptured by the french and shot the arrangement adopted when they started that the officer 
prisoners should be kept separate from the rest had long since been abandoned all who 
could walk went together and after the third stage pierre had rejoined karatáev and the 
gray blue bandy legged dog that had chosen karatáev for its master on the third 
day after leaving moscow karatáev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from 
in the hospital in moscow and as he grew gradually weaker pierre kept away from 
him pierre did not know why but since karatáev had begun to grow weaker it 
had cost him an effort to go near him when he did so and heard 
the subdued moaning with which karatáev generally lay down at the halting places and when 
he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before pierre moved 
farther away and did not think about him while imprisoned in the shed pierre had 
learned not with his intellect but with his whole being by life itself that man 
is created for happiness that happiness is within him in the satisfaction of simple human 
needs and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity and now during 
these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new consolatory nothing 
in this world is terrible he had learned that as there is no condition in 
which man can be happy and entirely free so there is no condition in which 
he need be unhappy and lack freedom he learned that suffering and freedom have their 
limits and that those limits are very near together that the person in a bed 
of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now sleeping on the 
bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while the other was warming and that 
when he had put on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did 
now when he walked with bare feet that were covered with footgear having long since 
fallen to pieces he discovered that when he had married his his own free will 
as it had seemed to had been no more free than now when they locked 
him up at night in a stable of all that he himself subsequently termed his 
sufferings but which at the time he scarcely felt the worst was the state of 
his bare raw and scab covered feet the horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing the saltpeter 
flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant there was no 
great cold it was always warm walking in the daytime and at night there were 
the campfires the lice that devoured him warmed his body the one thing that was 
at first hard to bear was his feet after the second march pierre having examined 
his feet by the campfire thought it would be impossible to walk on them but 
when everybody got up he went along limping and when he had warmed up walked 
without feeling the pain though at night his feet were more terrible to look at 
than before however he did not look at them now but thought of other things 
only now did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the saving 
power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another which is like 
the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the 
pressure exceeds a certain limit he did not see and did not hear how they 
shot the prisoners who lagged behind though more than a hundred perished in that way 
he did not think of karatáev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon 
have to share that fate still less did pierre think about himself the harder his 
position became and the more terrible the future the more independent of that position in 
which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts memories and imaginings that came 
to him chapter xiii at midday on the twenty second of october pierre was going 
uphill along the muddy slippery road looking at his feet and at the roughness of 
the way occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at 
his feet the former and the latter were alike familiar and his own the blue 
gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road sometimes in proof 
of its agility and self satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three 
and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at the crows that 
sat on the carrion the dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in 
moscow all around lay the flesh of different men to various stages of decomposition and 
as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all 
it wanted it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any 
moment it might cease and the sky clear but after a short break it began 
raining harder than before the saturated road no longer absorbed the water which ran along 
the ruts in streams pierre walked along looking from side to side counting his steps 
in threes and reckoning them off on his fingers mentally addressing the rain he repeated 
then now then go on pelt harder it seemed to him that he was thinking 
of nothing but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something 
important and comforting this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with 
karatáev the day before at their halting place feeling chilly by a dying campfire pierre 
had got up and gone to the next one which was burning better there platón 
karatáev was sitting covered and his greatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the 
soldiers in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew it 
was already past midnight the hour when karatáev was usually free of his fever and 
particularly lively when pierre reached the fire and heard voice enfeebled by illness and saw 
his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze he felt a painful prick at 
his heart his feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to 
go away but there was no other fire and pierre sat down trying not to 
look at platón how are you he asked am i if we grumble at sickness 
god grant us death replied platón and at once resumed the story he had begun 
so brother he continued with a smile on his pale emaciated face and a particularly 
happy light in his eyes see brother pierre had long been familiar with that story 
karatáev had told it to him alone some half dozen times and always with a 
specially joyful emotion but well as he knew it pierre now listened to that tale 
as to something new and the quiet rapture karatáev evidently felt as he told it 
communicated itself also to pierre the story was of an old merchant who lived a 
good and god fearing life with his family and who went once to the nízhni 
fair with a rich merchant having put up at an inn they both went to 
sleep and next morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut a 
bloodstained knife was found under the old pillow he was tried knouted and his nostrils 
having been torn off in due as karatáev put it he was sent to hard 
labor in siberia so it was at this point that pierre came up years or 
more passed by the old man was living as a convict submitting as he should 
and doing no wrong only he prayed to god for death well one night the 
convicts were gathered just as we are with the old man among them and they 
began telling what each was suffering for and how they had sinned against god one 
told how he had taken a life another had taken two a third had set 
a house on fire while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing 
so they asked the old man are you being punished for daddy my dear brothers 
said he being punished for my own and other sins but i have not killed 
anyone or taken anything that was not mine but have only helped my poorer brothers 
i was a merchant my dear brothers and had much property he went on to 
tell them all about it in due order grieve for myself he says it seems 
has chastened me only i am sorry for my old wife and the children and 
the old man began to weep now it happened that in the group was the 
very man who had killed the other merchant did it happen daddy he said and 
in what month he asked all about it and his heart began to ache so 
he comes up to the old man like this and falls down at his feet 
are perishing because of me daddy he says quite true lads that this man he 
says being tortured innocently and for nothing i he says that deed and i put 
the knife under your head while you were asleep forgive me daddy he says sake 
karatáev paused smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire and he drew the logs 
together the old man said will forgive you we are all sinners in his sight 
i suffer for my own sins and he wept bitter tears well and what do 
you think dear friends karatáev continued his face brightening more and more with a rapturous 
smile as if what he now had to tell contained the chief charm and the 
whole meaning of his story do you think dear fellows that murderer confessed to the 
authorities have taken six lives he says he was a great sinner what i am 
most sorry for is this old man let him suffer because of me so he 
confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form 
the place was a long way off and while they were judging what with one 
thing and another filling in the papers all in due authorities i passed the affair 
reached the tsar after a while the decree came to set the merchant free and 
give him a compensation that had been awarded the paper arrived and they began to 
look for the old man is the old man who has been suffering innocently and 
in vain a paper has come from the tsar so they began looking for him 
here lower jaw trembled god had already forgiven was dead how it was dear fellows 
karatáev concluded and sat for a long time silent gazing before him with a smile 
and soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself but by its 
mysterious significance by the rapturous joy that lit up face as he told it and 
the mystic significance of that joy chapter xiv vos places suddenly cried a voice your 
places a pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful and solemn was 
aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the prisoners from all sides came shouts 
of command and from the left came smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses passing the 
prisoners at a trot the expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at 
the approach of those in authority the prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the 
road the convoy formed up emperor the emperor the marshal the duke and hardly had 
the sleek cavalry passed before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by pierre 
caught a glimpse of a man in a three cornered hat with a tranquil look 
on his handsome plump white face it was one of the marshals his eye fell 
on large and striking figure and in the expression with which he frowned and looked 
away pierre thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy the general 
in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red and frightened face 
whipping up his skinny horse several officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round 
them their faces all looked excited and worried did he say what did he say 
pierre heard them ask while the marshal was passing the prisoners had huddled together in 
a crowd and pierre saw karatáev whom he had not yet seen that morning he 
sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree on his face besides the 
look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling the tale of the merchant 
who suffered innocently there was now an expression of quiet solemnity karatáev looked at pierre 
with his kindly round eyes now filled with tears evidently wishing him to come near 
that he might say something to him but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself 
he made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away when 
the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round karatáev was still sitting at the side 
of the road under the birch tree and two frenchmen were talking over his head 
pierre did not look round again but went limping up the hill from behind where 
karatáev had been sitting came the sound of a shot pierre heard it plainly but 
at that moment he remembered that he had not yet finished reckoning up how many 
stages still remained to calculation he had begun before the marshal went by and he 
again started reckoning two french soldiers ran past pierre one of whom carried a lowered 
and smoking gun they both looked pale and in the expression on their of them 
glanced timidly at was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the 
young soldier at the execution pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that two days 
before that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how 
they had laughed at him behind him where karatáev had been sitting the dog began 
to howl a stupid beast why is it howling thought pierre his comrades the prisoner 
soldiers walking beside him avoided looking back at the place where the shot had been 
fired and the dog was howling just as pierre did but there was a set 
look on all their faces chapter xv the stores the prisoners and the baggage train 
stopped at the village of shámshevo the men crowded together round the campfires pierre went 
up to the fire ate some roast horseflesh lay down with his back to the 
fire and immediately fell asleep he again slept as he had done at mozháysk after 
the battle of borodinó again real events mingled with dreams and again someone he or 
another gave expression to his thoughts and even to the same thoughts that had been 
expressed in his dream at mozháysk is everything life is god everything changes and moves 
and that movement is god and while there is life there is joy in consciousness 
of the divine to love life is to love god harder and more blessed than 
all else is to love this life in sufferings in innocent sufferings came to mind 
and suddenly he saw vividly before him a long forgotten kindly old man who had 
given him geography lessons in switzerland a bit said the old man and showed pierre 
a globe this globe was vibrating ball without fixed dimensions its whole surface consisted of 
drops closely pressed together and all these drops moved and changed places sometimes several of 
them merging into one sometimes one dividing into many each drop tried to spread out 
and occupy as much space as possible but others striving to do the same compressed 
it sometimes destroyed it and sometimes merged with it is life said the old teacher 
simple and clear it is thought pierre is it i did not know it before 
is in the midst and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect him 
to the greatest extent and it grows merges disappears from the surface sinks to the 
depths and again emerges there now karatáev has spread out and disappeared do you understand 
my child said the teacher you understand damn you shouted a voice and pierre woke 
up he lifted himself and sat up a frenchman who had just pushed a russian 
soldier away was squatting by the fire engaged in roasting a piece of meat stuck 
on a ramrod his sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy hairy red hands with 
their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod his brown morose face with frowning brows was 
clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal all the same to him he muttered 
turning quickly to a soldier who stood behind him get away and twisting the ramrod 
he looked gloomily at pierre who turned away and gazed into the darkness a prisoner 
the russian soldier the frenchman had pushed away was sitting near the fire patting something 
with his hand looking more closely pierre recognized the blue gray dog sitting beside the 
soldier wagging its tail come said pierre he began but did not finish suddenly and 
simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his the look platón had given him as 
he sat under the tree of the shot heard from that spot of the howl 
of the guilty faces of the two frenchmen as they ran past him of the 
lowered and smoking gun and of absence at this he was on the point of 
realizing that karatáev had been killed but just at that instant he knew not why 
the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a 
beautiful polish lady on the veranda of his house in kiev and without linking up 
the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from them pierre closed his eyes 
seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of 
the liquid vibrating globe and he sank into water so that it closed over his 
head before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing french soldiers 
were running past him cossacks one of them shouted and a moment later a crowd 
of russians surrounded pierre for a long time he could not understand what was happening 
to him all around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy dear fellows darlings old 
soldiers exclaimed weeping as they embraced cossacks and hussars the hussars and cossacks crowded round 
the prisoners one offered them clothes another boots and a third bread pierre sobbed as 
he sat among them and could not utter a word he hugged the first soldier 
who approached him and kissed him weeping dólokhov stood at the gate of the ruined 
house letting a crowd of disarmed frenchmen pass by the french excited by all that 
had happened were talking loudly among themselves but as they passed dólokhov who gently switched 
his boots with his whip and watched them with cold glassy eyes that boded no 
good they became silent on the opposite side stood cossack counting the prisoners and marking 
off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate many dólokhov asked the cossack 
second hundred replied the cossack filez dólokhov kept saying having adopted this expression from the 
french and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they flashed with a cruel 
light along get along denísov bareheaded and with a gloomy face walked behind some cossacks 
who were carrying the body of pétya rostóv to a hole that had been dug 
in the garden chapter xvi after the twenty eighth of october when the frosts began 
the flight of the french assumed a still more tragic character with men freezing or 
roasting themselves to death at the campfires while carriages with people dressed in furs continued 
to drive past carrying away the property that had been stolen by the emperor kings 
and dukes but the process of the flight and disintegration of the french army went 
on essentially as before from moscow to vyázma the french army of seventy three thousand 
men not reckoning the guards who did nothing during the whole war but pillage was 
reduced to thirty six thousand though not more than five thousand had fallen in battle 
from this beginning the succeeding terms of the progression could be determined mathematically the french 
army melted away and perished at the same rate from moscow to vyázma from vyázma 
to smolénsk from smolénsk to the berëzina and from the berëzina to of the greater 
or lesser intensity of the cold the pursuit the barring of the way or any 
other particular conditions beyond vyázma the french army instead of moving in three columns huddled 
together into one mass and so went on to the end berthier wrote to his 
emperor we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in 
describing the condition of an army and this is what he said i deem it 
my duty to report to your majesty the condition of the various corps i have 
had occasion to observe during different stages of the last two or three march they 
are almost disbanded scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of their 
regiments the others go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and 
escape discipline in general they regard smolénsk as the place where they hope to recover 
during the last few days many of the men have been seen to throw away 
their cartridges and their arms in such a state of affairs whatever your ultimate plans 
may be the interest of your service demands that the army should be rallied at 
smolénsk and should first of all be freed from ineffectives such as dismounted cavalry unnecessary 
baggage and artillery material that is no longer in proportion to the present forces the 
soldiers who are worn out with hunger and fatigue need these supplies as well as 
a few rest many have died these last days on the road or at the 
bivouacs this state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that unless 
a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under control in case 
of an engagement november 9 twenty miles from smolénsk after staggering into smolénsk which seemed 
to them a promised land the french searching for food killed one another sacked their 
own stores and when everything had been plundered fled farther they all went without knowing 
whither or why they were going still less did that genius napoleon know it for 
no one issued any orders to him but still he and those about him retained 
their old habits wrote commands letters reports and orders of the day called one another 
sire mon cousin prince roi de naples and so on but these orders and reports 
were only on paper nothing in them was acted upon for they could not be 
carried out and though they entitled one another majesties highnesses or cousins they all felt 
that they were miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now 
to pay and though they pretended to be concerned about the army each was thinking 
only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself chapter xvii 
the movements of the russian and french armies during the campaign from moscow back to 
the niemen were like those in a game of russian buff in which two players 
are blindfolded and one of them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher 
of his whereabouts first he rings his bell fearlessly but when he gets into a 
tight place he runs away as quietly as he can and often thinking to escape 
runs straight into his arms at first while they were still moving along the kalúga 
road armies made their presence known but later when they reached the smolénsk road they 
ran holding the clapper of their bell often thinking they were escaping ran right into 
the russians owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit and 
the consequent exhaustion of the horses the chief means of approximately ascertaining the cavalry not 
available besides as a result of the frequent and rapid change of position by each 
army even what information was obtained could not be delivered in time if news was 
received one day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before 
by the third day when something could have been done that army was already two 
march farther on and in quite another position one army fled and the other pursued 
beyond smolénsk there were several different roads available for the french and one would have 
thought that during their stay of four days they might have learned where the enemy 
was might have arranged some more advantageous plan and undertaken something new but after a 
four halt the mob with no maneuvers or plans again began running along the beaten 
track neither to the right nor to the left but along the through krásnoe and 
orshá expecting the enemy from behind and not in front the french separated in their 
flight and spread out over a distance of twenty four hours in front of them 
all fled the emperor then the kings then the dukes the russian army expecting napoleon 
to take the road to the right beyond the was the only reasonable thing for 
him to turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at krásnoe and 
here as in a game of buff the french ran into our vanguard seeing their 
enemy unexpectedly the french fell into confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright but 
then they resumed their flight abandoning their comrades who were farther behind then for three 
days separate portions of the french the vice then and then as it were the 
gauntlet of the russian army they abandoned one another abandoned all their heavy baggage their 
artillery and half their men and fled getting past the russians by night by making 
semicircles to the right ney who came last had been busying himself blowing up the 
walls of smolénsk which were in way because despite the unfortunate plight of the french 
or because of it they wished to punish the floor against which they had hurt 
themselves ney who had had a corps of ten thousand men reached napoleon at orshá 
with only one thousand men left having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon 
and having crossed the dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot from orshá 
they fled farther along the road to vílna still playing at buff with the pursuing 
army at the berëzina they again became disorganized many were drowned and many surrendered but 
those who got across the river fled farther their supreme chief donned a fur coat 
and having seated himself in a sleigh galloped on alone abandoning his companions the others 
who could do so drove away too leaving those who could not to surrender or 
die chapter xviii this campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which they 
did all they could to destroy themselves from the time they turned onto the kalúga 
road to the day their leader fled from the army none of the movements of 
the crowd had any sense so one might have thought that regarding this period of 
the campaign the historians who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of 
one man would have found it impossible to make the story of the retreat fit 
their theory but no mountains of books have been written by the historians about this 
campaign and everywhere are described arrangements the maneuvers and his profound plans which guided the 
army as well as the military genius shown by his marshals the retreat from málo 
yaroslávets when he had a free road into a well supplied district and the parallel 
road was open to him along which kutúzov afterwards pursued unnecessary retreat along a devastated 
explained to us as being due to profound considerations similarly profound considerations are given for 
his retreat from smolénsk to orshá then his heroism at krásnoe is described where he 
is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take personal command and to 
have walked about with a birch stick and said assez fait il est temps de 
faire le général but nevertheless immediately ran away again abandoning to its fate the scattered 
fragments of the army he left behind have acted the emperor long enough it is 
time to act the general then we are told of the greatness of soul of 
the marshals especially of greatness of soul consisting in this that he made his way 
by night around through the forest and across the dnieper and escaped to orshá abandoning 
standards artillery and nine tenths of his men and lastly the final departure of the 
great emperor from his heroic army is presented to us by the historians as something 
great and characteristic of genius even that final running away described in ordinary language as 
the lowest depth of baseness which every child is taught to be ashamed that act 
finds justification in the language when it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads 
of historical ratiocination any farther when actions are clearly contrary to all that humanity calls 
right or even just the historians produce a saving conception of it seems excludes the 
standards of right and wrong for the man nothing is wrong there is no atrocity 
for which a man can be blamed grand say the historians and there no longer 
exists either good or evil but only and grand grand is good not grand is 
bad grand is the characteristic in their conception of some special animals called and napoleon 
escaping home in a warm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not 
merely his comrades but were in his opinion men he had brought there feels que 
grand 2 and his soul is tranquil is great 2 that it is great sublime 
he saw something sublime in himself au ridicule il a pas said he and the 
whole world for fifty years has been repeating grand napoléon le grand du sublime au 
ridicule il a pas the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step and it 
occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with the standard of 
right and wrong is merely to admit own nothingness and immeasurable meanness for us with 
the standard of good and evil given us by christ no human actions are incommensurable 
and there is no greatness where simplicity goodness and truth are absent chapter xix what 
russian reading the account of the last part of the campaign of 1812 has not 
experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret dissatisfaction and perplexity who has not asked himself how 
it is that the french were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies 
surrounded them in superior numbers when the disordered french hungry and freezing surrendered in crowds 
and when as the historians relate the aim of the russians was to stop the 
french to cut them off and capture them all how was it that the russian 
army which when numerically weaker than the french had given battle at borodinó did not 
achieve its purpose when it had surrounded the french on three sides and when its 
aim was to capture them can the french be so enormously superior to us that 
when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them how could 
that happen history or what is called by that name replying to these questions says 
that this occurred because kutúzov and tormásov and chichagóv and this man and that man 
did not execute such and such maneuvers but why did they not execute those maneuvers 
and why if they were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they 
not tried and punished but even if we admitted that kutúzov chichagóv and others were 
the cause of the russian failures it is still incomprehensible why the position of the 
russian army being what it was at krásnoe and at the berëzina in both cases 
we had superior forces the french army with its marshals kings and emperor was not 
captured if that was what the russians aimed at the explanation of this strange fact 
given by russian military historians to the effect that kutúzov hindered an attack is unfounded 
for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at vyázma and 
tarútino why was the russian with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength 
at at krásnoe and the berëzina by the disorganized crowds of the french when it 
was numerically superior if the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturing 
napoleon and his that aim was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it 
were most shamefully this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the 
french to be a series of victories and quite wrongly considered victorious by russian historians 
the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of logic must 
admit that conclusion and in spite of their lyrical rhapsodies about valor devotion and so 
forth must reluctantly admit that the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories 
for napoleon and defeats for kutúzov but putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that 
such a conclusion involves a contradiction since the series of french victories brought the french 
complete destruction while the series of russian defeats led to the total destruction of their 
enemy and the liberation of their country the source of this contradiction lies in the 
fact that the historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the 
generals from memoirs reports projects and so forth have attributed to this last period of 
the war of 1812 an aim that never existed namely that of cutting off and 
capturing napoleon with his marshals and his army there never was or could have been 
such an aim for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible it 
would have been senseless first because disorganized army was flying from russia with all possible 
speed that is to say was doing just what every russian desired so what was 
the use of performing various operations on the french who were running away as fast 
as they possibly could secondly it would have been senseless to block the passage of 
men whose whole energy was directed to flight thirdly it would have been senseless to 
sacrifice own troops in order to destroy the french army which without external interference was 
destroying itself at such a rate that though its path was not blocked it could 
not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in december namely a hundredth 
part of the original army fourthly it would have been senseless to wish to take 
captive the emperor kings and capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for 
the russians as the most adroit diplomatists of the time joseph de maistre and others 
recognized still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the 
french when our own army had melted away to half before reaching krásnoe and a 
whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners and when our 
men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of 
hunger all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon and his army were 
like the plan of a market gardener who when driving out of his garden a 
cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted should run to the gate 
and hit the cow on the head the only thing to be said in excuse 
of that gardener would be that he was very angry but not even that could 
be said for those who drew up this project for it was not they who 
had suffered from the trampled beds but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with 
his army would have been senseless it was impossible it was impossible first experience shows 
that a three mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the probability 
of chichagóv kutúzov and wittgenstein effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was 
so remote as to be tantamount to impossibility as in fact thought kutúzov who when 
he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the 
desired results secondly it was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with which army was 
retiring incomparably greater forces than the russians possessed would have been required thirdly it was 
impossible because the military term cut has no meaning one can cut off a slice 
of bread but not an army to cut off an bar its quite impossible for 
there is always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when 
nothing can be seen as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example of 
krásnoe and of the berëzina it is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree 
to be captured just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it 
settles on hand men can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the 
rules of strategy and tactics as the germans did but the french troops quite rightly 
did not consider that this suited them since death by hunger and cold awaited them 
in flight or captivity alike fourthly and chiefly it was impossible because never since the 
world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained in 
1812 and the russian army in its pursuit of the french strained its strength to 
the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself during the movement of 
the russian army from tarútino to krásnoe it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers that 
is a number equal to the population of a large provincial town half the men 
fell out of the army without a battle and it is of this period of 
the the army lacked boots and sheepskin coats was short of provisions and without vodka 
and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of 
frost when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was 
night in which the influence of discipline cannot be maintained when men were taken into 
that region of death where discipline fails not for a few hours only as in 
a battle but for months where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and 
cold when half the army perished in a single is of this period of the 
campaign that the historians tell us how milorádovich should have made a flank march to 
such and such a place tormásov to another place and chichagóv should have crossed more 
than knee deep in snow to somewhere else and how so and so and the 
french and so on and so on the russians half of whom died did all 
that could and should have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation 
and they are not to blame because other russians sitting in warm rooms proposed that 
they should do what was impossible all that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between 
the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians dealing with the matter 
have written the history of the beautiful words and sentiments of various generals and not 
the history of the events to them the words of milorádovich seem very interesting and 
so do their surmises and the rewards this or that general received but the question 
of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does not 
even interest them for it does not come within the range of their investigation yet 
one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and consider the 
movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a direct part in the 
events and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and 
certain solution the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in 
the imaginations of a dozen people it could not exist because it was senseless and 
unattainable the people had a single aim to free their land from invasion that aim 
was attained in the first place of itself as the french ran away and so 
it was only necessary not to stop their flight secondly it was attained by the 
guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french and thirdly by the fact that a large 
russian army was following the french ready to use its strength in case their movement 
stopped the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal and 
the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace 
than to strike the running animal on the head book fifteen 1812 13 chapter i 
when seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror substance similar to 
his own is perishing before his eyes but when it is a beloved and intimate 
human being that is dying besides this horror at the extinction of life there is 
a severance a spiritual wound which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes 
heals but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch after prince death natásha 
and princess mary alike felt this drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the 
menacing cloud of death that overhung them they dared not look life in the face 
they carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact everything a carriage 
passing rapidly in the street a summons to dinner the inquiry what dress to prepare 
or worse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy seemed an insult painfully irritated 
the wound interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to listen to the 
stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in their imagination and hindered their gazing into 
those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them only when 
alone together were they free from such outrage and pain they spoke little even to 
one another and when they did it was of very unimportant matters both avoided any 
allusion to the future to admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to 
insult his memory still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was 
dead it seemed to them that what they had lived through and experienced could not 
be expressed in words and that any reference to the details of his life infringed 
the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before their eyes continued 
abstention from speech and constant avoidance of everything that might lead up to the halting 
on all sides at the boundary of what they might not before their minds with 
still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling but pure and complete sorrow 
is as impossible as pure and complete joy princess mary in her position as absolute 
and independent arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew was 
the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which 
she had dwelt for the first fortnight she received letters from her relations to which 
she had to reply the room in which little nicholas had been put was damp 
and he began to cough alpátych came to yaroslávl with reports on the state of 
their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to moscow to the 
house on the vozdvízhenka street which had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs life 
did not stand still and it was necessary to live hard as it was for 
princess mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived 
till then and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave natásha alone yet 
the cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded to them she went 
through the accounts with alpátych conferred with dessalles about her nephew and gave orders and 
made preparations for the journey to moscow natásha remained alone and from the time princess 
mary began making preparations for departure held aloof from her too princess mary asked the 
countess to let natásha go with her to moscow and both parents gladly accepted this 
offer for they saw their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change 
of scene and the advice of moscow doctors would be good for her am not 
going anywhere natásha replied when this was proposed to her please just leave me alone 
and she ran out of the room with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and 
irritation rather than of sorrow after she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone 
in her grief natásha spent most of the time in her room by herself sitting 
huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa tearing and twisting something 
with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced 
to fall on this solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need 
of it as soon as anyone entered she got up quickly changed her position and 
expression and picked up a book or some sewing evidently waiting impatiently for the intruder 
to go she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate 
that on a terrible questioning too great for her spiritual gaze was fixed one day 
toward the end of december natásha pale and thin dressed in a black woolen gown 
her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot was crouched feet and all in the 
corner of her sofa nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while 
she looked at a corner of the door she was gazing in the direction in 
which he had the other side of life and that other side of life of 
which she had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far 
away and improbable was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side 
of life where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering and indignity she was 
gazing where she knew him to be but she could not imagine him otherwise than 
as he had been here she now saw him again as he had been at 
mytíshchi at tróitsa and at yaroslávl she saw his face heard his voice repeated his 
words and her own and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken there he 
is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak leaning his head on his 
thin pale hand his chest is dreadfully hollow and his shoulders raised his lips are 
firmly closed his eyes glitter and a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead 
one of his legs twitches just perceptibly but rapidly natásha knows that he is struggling 
with terrible pain is that pain like why does he have that pain what does 
he feel how does it hurt him thought natásha he noticed her watching him raised 
his eyes and began to speak seriously thing would be terrible said he bind oneself 
forever to a suffering man it would be continual torture and he looked searchingly at 
her natásha as usual answered before she had time to think what she would say 
she said go you will get well she now saw him from the commencement of 
that scene and relived what she had then felt she recalled his long sad and 
severe look at those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in 
that protracted gaze agreed natásha now said to herself it would be dreadful if he 
always continued to suffer i said it then only because it would have been dreadful 
for him but he understood it differently he thought it would be dreadful for me 
he then still wished to live and feared death and i said it so awkwardly 
and stupidly i did not say what i meant i thought quite differently had i 
said what i thought i should have said even if he had to go on 
dying to die continually before my eyes i should have been happy compared with what 
i am now now there is nothing nobody did he know that no he did 
not and never will know it and now it will never never be possible to 
put it right and now he again seemed to be saying the same words to 
her only in her imagination natásha this time gave him a different answer she stopped 
him and said for you but not for me you know that for me there 
is nothing in life but you and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness 
for me and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it 
that terrible evening four days before his death and in her imagination she said other 
tender and loving words which she might have said then but only spoke now love 
thee thee i love love she said convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth 
with a desperate effort she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising 
in her eyes then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this again 
everything was shrouded in hard dry perplexity and again with a strained frown she peered 
toward the world where he was and now now it seemed to her she was 
penetrating the mystery but at the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing 
itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears 
dunyásha her maid entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on her 
face and showing no concern for her mistress to your papa at once please said 
she with a strange excited look misfortune about peter ilýnich a letter she finished with 
a sob chapter ii besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody natásha was feeling a 
special estrangement from the members of her own family all of father mother and so 
near to her so familiar so commonplace that all their words and feelings seemed an 
insult to the world in which she had been living of late and she felt 
not merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility she heard words about peter 
ilýnich and a misfortune but did not grasp them misfortune what misfortune can happen to 
them they just live their own old quiet and commonplace life thought natásha as she 
entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her room his face was 
puckered up and wet with tears he had evidently run out of that room to 
give vent to the sobs that were choking him when he saw natásha he waved 
his arms despairingly and burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face 
pétya go go she is calling and weeping like a child and quickly shuffling on 
his feeble legs to a chair he almost fell into it covering his face with 
his hands suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through whole being terrible anguish struck 
her heart she felt a dreadful ache as if something was being torn inside her 
and she were dying but the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release 
from the oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life the sight of 
her father the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the door 
made her immediately forget herself and her own grief she ran to her father but 
he feebly waved his arm pointing to her door princess mary pale and with quivering 
chin came out from that room and taking natásha by the arm said something to 
her natásha neither saw nor heard her she went in with rapid steps pausing at 
the door for an instant as if struggling with herself and then ran to her 
mother the countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position stretching 
out and beating her head against the wall sónya and the maids were holding her 
arms natásha cried the countess not true not true lying natásha she shrieked pushing those 
around her away away all of you not true killed ha ha ha not true 
natásha put one knee on the armchair stooped over her mother embraced her and with 
unexpected strength raised her turned her face toward herself and clung to her darling i 
am here my dearest mummy she kept on whispering not pausing an instant she did 
not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her demanded a pillow and 
hot water and unfastened and tore open her dress dearest darling mummy my precious she 
whispered incessantly kissing her head her hands her face and feeling her own irrepressible and 
streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks the countess pressed her hand closed her eyes 
and became quiet for a moment suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness glanced vacantly 
around her and seeing natásha began to press her head with all her strength then 
she turned toward her face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it 
you love me she said in a soft trustful whisper you would not deceive me 
tell me the whole truth natásha looked at her with eyes full of tears and 
in her look there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness darling mummy 
she repeated straining all the power of her love to find some way of taking 
on herself the excess of grief that crushed her mother and again in a futile 
struggle with reality her mother refusing to believe that she could live when her beloved 
boy was killed in the bloom of life escaped from reality into a world of 
delirium natásha did not remember how that day passed nor that night nor the next 
day and night she did not sleep and did not leave her mother her persevering 
and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess every moment not explaining or consoling 
but recalling her to life during the third night the countess kept very quiet for 
a few minutes and natásha rested her head on the arm of her chair and 
closed her eyes but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak the countess was 
sitting up in bed and speaking softly glad i am you have come you are 
tired you have some tea natásha went up to her have improved in looks and 
grown more manly continued the countess taking her hand what are you saying he is 
no more no more and embracing her daughter the countess began to weep for the 
first time chapter iii princess mary postponed her departure sónya and the count tried to 
replace natásha but could not they saw that she alone was able to restrain her 
mother from unreasoning despair for three weeks natásha remained constantly at her side sleeping on 
a lounge chair in her room making her eat and drink and talking to her 
incessantly because the mere sound of her tender caressing tones soothed her mother the wounded 
spirit could not heal death had torn from her half her life when the news 
of death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty but 
a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in 
life but the same blow that almost killed the countess this second blow restored natásha 
to life a spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like 
a physical wound and strange as it may seem just as a deep wound may 
heal and its edges join physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only 
as the result of a vital force from within wound healed in that way she 
thought her life was ended but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that 
the essence of still active within her love awoke and so did life prince last 
days had bound princess mary and natásha together this new sorrow brought them still closer 
to one another princess mary put off her departure and for three weeks looked after 
natásha as if she had been a sick child the last weeks passed in her 
bedroom had strained physical strength one afternoon noticing natásha shivering with fever princess mary took 
her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed natásha lay 
down but when princess mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called 
her back want to sleep mary sit by me a little are to sleep no 
why did you bring me away she will be asking for me is much better 
she spoke so well today said princess mary natásha lay on the bed and in 
the semidarkness of the room scanned princess face she like him thought natásha like and 
yet not like but she is quite original strange new and unknown and she loves 
me what is in her heart all that is good but how what is her 
mind like what does she think about me yes she is splendid she said timidly 
drawing princess hand to herself you think me wicked no mary darling how i love 
you let us be quite quite friends and natásha embracing her began kissing her face 
and hands making princess mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings 
from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was 
established between princess mary and natásha they were continually kissing and saying tender things to 
one another and spent most of their time together when one went out the other 
became restless and hastened to rejoin her together they felt more in harmony with one 
another than either of them felt with herself when alone a feeling stronger than friendship 
sprang up between them an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each presence 
sometimes they were silent for hours sometimes after they were already in bed they would 
begin talking and go on till morning they spoke most of what was long past 
princess mary spoke of her childhood of her mother her father and her daydreams and 
natásha who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life 
of devotion submission and the poetry of christian self sacrifice now feeling herself bound to 
princess mary by affection learned to love her past too and to understand a side 
of life previously incomprehensible to her she did not think of applying submission and self 
abnegation to her own life for she was accustomed to seek other joys but she 
understood and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues for princess mary listening to tales 
of childhood and early youth there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side 
of life belief in life and its enjoyment just as before they never mentioned him 
so as not to lower as they thought their exalted feelings by words but this 
silence about him had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without 
being conscious of it natásha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that 
they all talked about her health and this pleased her but sometimes she was suddenly 
overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness weakness and loss of good 
looks and involuntarily she examined her bare arm carefully surprised at its thinness and in 
the morning noticed her drawn and as it seemed to her piteous face in her 
glass it seemed to her that things must be so and yet it was dreadfully 
sad one day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath unconsciously she 
immediately invented a reason for going down and then testing her strength ran upstairs again 
observing the result another time when she called dunyásha her voice trembled so she called 
she could hear dunyásha her in the deep chest tones in which she had been 
wont to sing and listened attentively to herself she did not know and would not 
have believed it but beneath the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed 
to her impenetrable delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting which taking root would 
so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it would 
soon no longer be seen or noticed the wound had begun to heal from within 
at the end of january princess mary left for moscow and the count insisted on 
going with her to consult the doctors chapter iv after the encounter at vyázma where 
kutúzov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and 
cut off the enemy and so on the farther movement of the fleeing french and 
of the russians who pursued them continued as far as krásnoe without a battle the 
flight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the french could not keep up 
with them cavalry and artillery horses broke down and the information received of the movements 
of the french was never reliable the men in the russian army were so worn 
out by this continuous marching at the rate of twenty seven miles a day that 
they could not go any faster to realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian 
army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that while 
not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarútino and less than a 
hundred prisoners the russian army which left that place a hundred thousand strong reached krásnoe 
with only fifty thousand the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to 
our army as the flight of the french was to theirs the only difference was 
that the russian army moved voluntarily with no such threat of destruction as hung over 
the french and that the sick frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the 
sick russians left behind were among their own people the chief cause of the wastage 
of army was the rapidity of its movement and a convincing proof of this is 
the corresponding decrease of the russian army kutúzov as far as was in his power 
instead of trying to check the movement of the french as was desired in petersburg 
and by the russian army generals directed his whole activity here as he had done 
at tarútino and vyázma to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army 
but besides this since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the 
rapidity of the advance had become evident another reason for slackening the pace and delaying 
presented itself to kutúzov the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french 
the road the french would take was unknown and so the closer our troops trod 
on their heels the greater distance they had to cover only by following at some 
distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french all the artful maneuvers 
suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its 
marches whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches to that end activity 
was directed during the whole campaign from moscow to casually or intermittently but so consistently 
that he never once deviated from it kutúzov felt and by reasoning or science but 
with the whole of his russian every russian soldier felt that the french were beaten 
that the enemy was flying and must be driven out but at the same time 
he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march the rapidity of which 
was unparalleled for such a time of the year but to the generals especially the 
foreign ones in the russian army who wished to distinguish themselves to astonish somebody and 
for some reason to capture a king or a seemed that any battle must be 
horrible and the very time to fight and conquer somebody kutúzov merely shrugged his shoulders 
when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those shod 
insufficiently clad and half within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to 
half their number and who at the best if the flight continued would have to 
go a greater distance than they had already traversed before they reached the frontier this 
longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow and to cut off showed itself particularly 
whenever the russians stumbled on the french army so it was at krásnoe where they 
expected to find one of the three french columns and
