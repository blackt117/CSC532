driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about 
the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find 
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i 
meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it 
requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and 
methodically knocking hats i account it high time to get to sea as soon as 
i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato

in this if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time 
or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me there now 
is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharves as indian isles by 
coral surrounds it with her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its 
extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled 
by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land look at 
the crowds of water gazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go 
from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you 
see like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men 
fixed in ocean reveries some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pier heads 
some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the rigging 
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsmen 
of week days pent up in lath and to counters nailed to benches clinched to 
desks how then is this are the green fields gone what do they here but 
look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a 
dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under 
the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice no they must get just as 
nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in and there they of inlanders 
all they come from lanes and alleys streets and east south and west yet here 
they all unite tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses 
of all those ships attract them thither once more say you are in the country 
in some high land of lakes take almost any path you please and ten to

your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes as every one knows 
meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desires to 
paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the 
valley of the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees 
each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and 
here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes 
a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs 
of mountains bathed in their hill side blue but though the picture lies thus tranced 
and though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this head yet 
all were vain unless the eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go 
visit the prairies in june when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee 
deep among tiger is the one charm wanting is not a drop of water there 
were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see 
it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver 
deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money 
in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with 
a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to 
sea why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a 
mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight 
of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks 
give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not 
without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he 
could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it 
and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans 
it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key 
to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going 
to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be 
over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i 
ever go to sea as a passenger for to go as a passenger you must 
needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something 
in it besides passengers get sea sleep of not enjoy themselves much as a general 
thing i never go as a passenger nor though i am something of a salt 
do i ever go to sea as a commodore or a captain or a cook 
i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them for 
my part i abominate all honorable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever 
it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself without 
taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not and as for going as 
cook i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of 
officer on ship somehow i never fancied broiling fowls once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically 
salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say 
reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings 
of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the 
mummies of those creatures in their huge bake houses the pyramids no when i go 
to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into 
the forecastle aloft there to the royal mast head true they rather order me about 
some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may 
meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touches sense of 
honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van 
rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your 
hand into the tar pot you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster making 
the tallest boys stand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i 
assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca 
and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears 
off in time what of it if some old hunks of a sea captain orders 
me to get a broom and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount 
to weighed i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the 
archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that 
old hunks in that particular instance who a slave tell me that well then however 
the old sea captains may order me they may thump and punch me about i 
have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one 
way or other served in much the same in a physical or metaphysical point of 
view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hands should 
rub each shoulder blades and be content again i always go to sea as a 
sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never 
pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves 
must pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being 
paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard 
thieves entailed upon us but being paid will compare with it the urbane activity with 
which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money 
to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a 
monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition finally i always 
go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of 
the fore castle deck for as in this world head winds are far more prevalent 
than winds from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for 
the most part the commodore on the quarter deck gets his atmosphere at second hand 
from the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not so 
in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things 
at the same time that the leaders little suspect it but wherefore it was that 
after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor i should now take it 
into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of 
the fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences 
me in some unaccountable can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going 
on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that was drawn 
up a long time ago it came in as a sort of brief interlude and 
solo between more extensive performances i take it that this part of the bill must 
have run something like this grand contested election for the presidency of the united states 
voyage by one ishmael battle in affghanistan though i cannot tell why it was exactly 
that those stage managers the fates put me down for this shabby part of a 
whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short 
and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in i cannot tell why this 
was exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstances i think i can see 
a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various 
disguises induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into 
the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating 
judgment chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such 
a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity then the wild and distant seas 
where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with 
all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me 
to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not have been inducements but 
as for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote i love 
to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i 
am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with they let it 
is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place 
one lodges in by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the 
great flood gates of the wonder world swung open and in the wild conceits that 
swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless 
processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like 
a snow hill in the air chapter 2 the carpet bag i stuffed a shirt 
or two into my old carpet bag tucked it under my arm and started for 
cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived 
in new bedford it was a saturday night in december much was i disappointed upon 
learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of 
reaching that place would offer till the following monday as most young candidates for the 
pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on 
their voyage it may as well be related that i for one had no idea 
of so doing for my mind was made up to sail in no other than 
a nantucket craft because there was a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that 
famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has of late been 
gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is 
now much behind her yet nantucket was her great tyre of this carthage place where 
the first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal 
whalemen the red men first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan 
and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly 
laden with imported goes the throw at the whales in order to discover when they 
were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit now having a night a 
day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark 
for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat 
and sleep meanwhile it was a very dubious looking nay a very dark and dismal 
night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels 
i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silver wherever 
you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of a 
dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness 
towards the in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear 
ishmael be sure to inquire the price and be too particular with halting steps i 
paced the streets and passed the sign of crossed it looked too expensive and jolly 
there further on from the bright red windows of the fish inn there came such 
fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before 
the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard 
asphaltic pavement weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projections because 
from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight 
too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare 
in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within but go on 
ishmael said i at last you hear get away from before the door your patched 
boots are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the 
streets that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest 
inns such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and 
there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of 
the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved 
all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low 
wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look as 
if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the first thing 
i did was to stumble over an ash box in the porch ha thought i 
ha as the flying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city 
gomorrah but crossed harpoons and sword fish then must needs be the sign of trap 
however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened 
a second interior door it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred 
black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of 
doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the 
text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teeth gnashing 
there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of trap moving 
on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the 
docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging 
sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight 
jet of misty spray and these words spouter inn coffin coffin ominous in that particular 
connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i 
suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim 
and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house 
itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some 
burnt district and as the swinging sign had a poverty stricken sort of creak to 
it i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best 
of pea coffee it was a queer sort of gable ended old house one side 
palsied as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner 
where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about 
poor tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in doors 
with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed judging of that tempestuous wind 
called euroclydon says an old whose works i possess the only copy maketh a marvellous 
difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is 
all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the 
frost is on both sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier 
true enough thought i as this passage occurred to my black letter thou reasonest well 
yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house what a 
pity they stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little 
lint here and there but too late to make any improvements now the universe is 
finished the copestone is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago 
poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off 
his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put 
a corn cob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous 
euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his red silken he had a redder one afterwards 
pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them 
talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilege of making 
my own summer with my own coals but what thinks lazarus can he warm his 
blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather 
be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along 
the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself 
in order to keep out this frost now that lazarus should lie stranded there on 
the curbstone before the door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg 
should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like 
a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of 
a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans but no more of 
this blubbering now we are going a whaling and there is plenty of that yet 
to come let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet and see what sort 
of a place this may be chapter 3 the spouter inn entering that gable ended 
spouter inn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with old fashioned wainscots 
reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a 
very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights 
by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of 
systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way 
arrive at an understanding of its purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that 
at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new 
england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest 
contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the 
back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea 
however wild might not be altogether unwarranted but what most puzzled and confounded you was 
a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture 
over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy 
picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet was there a sort of 
indefinite half attained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you 
involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever 
and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you through the black sea 
in a midnight gale the unnatural combat of the four primal elements a blasted heath 
a hyperborean winter scene the breaking up of the icebound stream of time but at 
last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the midst that once 
found out and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a 
faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself in fact the design 
seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of 
many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a cape 
horner in a great hurricane the half foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled 
masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is 
in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast heads the opposite wall 
of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and 
spears some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with 
knots of human hair and one was sickle shaped with a vast handle sweeping round 
like the segment made in the new mown grass by a long armed mower you 
shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone 
a death harvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old 
whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once 
long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between 
a sunrise and a sunset and that like a corkscrew flung in javan seas and 
run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the 
original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body 
of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the 
hump crossing this dusky entry and on through yon low arched through what in old 
times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all enter the public room 
a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old 
wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old cockpits especially of 
such a howling night when this corner anchored old ark rocked so furiously on one 
side stood a long low shelf like table covered with cracked glass cases filled with 
dusty rarities gathered from this wide remotest nooks projecting from the further angle of the 
room stands a dark looking rude attempt at a right head be that how it 
may there stands the vast arched bone of the jaw so wide a coach might 
almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters bottles flasks 
and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed 
they called him bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells 
the sailors deliriums and death abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison 
though true cylinders the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom 
parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these goblets fill to this mark and 
your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to 
the full cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling upon entering 
the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by 
a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i 
desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house was a 
bed unoccupied avast he added tapping his forehead haint no objections to sharing a blanket 
have ye i you are a so better get used to that sort of thing 
i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if 
i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and 
that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer 
was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so 
bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent blanket thought 
so all right take a seat supper want supper be ready directly i sat down 
on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at 
one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack knife stooping 
over and diligently working away at the space between his legs he was trying his 
hand at a ship under full sail but he make much headway i thought at 
last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining 
room it was cold as fire at landlord said he afford it nothing but two 
dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our 
monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen 
fingers but the fare was of the most substantial only meat and potatoes but dumplings 
good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself 
to these dumplings in a most direful manner boy said the landlord have the nightmare 
to a dead sartainty i whispered aint the harpooneer is it no said he looking 
a sort of diabolically funny harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap he never eats dumplings 
he eats nothing but steaks and he likes rare devil he does says i is 
that harpooneer is he here be here afore long was the answer i could not 
help it but i began to feel suspicious of this harpooneer at any rate i 
made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together 
he must undress and get into bed before i did supper over the company went 
back to the bar room when knowing not what else to do with myself i 
resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on presently a rioting 
noise was heard without starting up the landlord cried the crew i seed her reported 
in the offing this morning a three voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now 
have the latest news from the feegees a tramping of sea boots was heard in 
the entry the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners 
enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters 
all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an eruption of 
bears from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this was the first 
house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the the 
wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained 
of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitch like 
potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds 
and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast 
of labrador or on the weather side of an ice island the liquor soon mounted 
into their heads as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from 
sea and they began capering about most obstreperously i observed however that one of them 
held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his 
shipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as 
much noise as the rest this man interested me at once and since the sea 
gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleeping partner 
one so far as this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little 
description of him he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a 
chest like a coffer dam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his 
face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while 
in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to 
give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner and 
from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from 
the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its 
height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he 
became my comrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by 
his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they 
raised a cry of bulkington bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of 
him it was now about nine and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these 
orgies i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me 
just previous to the entrance of the seamen no man prefers to sleep two in 
a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own 
brother i know how it is but people like to be private when they are 
sleeping and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn 
in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely multiply nor 
was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a 
bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at 
sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one 
apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and 
sleep in your own skin the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i 
abominated the thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a 
harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the 
tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it was 
getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now 
he should tumble in upon me at could i tell from what vile hole he 
had been coming changed my mind about that harpooneer sleep with him try the bench 
here as you please sorry i spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and a 
plaguy rough board of the knots and notches wait a bit skrimshander got a plane 
there in the i say and make ye snug enough so saying he procured the 
plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing 
away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shavings flew right and 
left till at last the plane iron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord 
was near spraining his wrist and i told him for sake to bed was soft 
enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the 
world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shavings with 
another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room 
he went about his business and left me in a brown study i now took 
the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but 
that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too narrow and 
the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed there 
was no yoking them i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear 
space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down 
in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over 
me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at 
all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window 
and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the 
spot where i had thought to spend the night the devil fetch that harpooneer thought 
i but stop i steal a march on his door inside and jump into his 
bed not to be wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea 
but upon second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next 
morning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing 
in the entry all ready to knock me down still looking round me again and 
seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other bed i 
began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown 
harpooneer thinks i wait awhile he must be dropping in before long have a good 
look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after no telling 
but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going 
to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer said i sort of a chap is 
he always keep such late hours it was now hard upon twelve the landlord chuckled 
again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my 
comprehension he answered an early to bed and airley to the bird what catches the 
worm but to night he went out a peddling you see and i see what 
on airth keeps him so late unless may be he sell his head sell his 
head sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a 
towering rage you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed 
saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town precisely it 
said the landlord i told him he sell it here the overstocked what shouted i 
heads to be sure there too many heads in the world tell you what it 
is landlord said i quite calmly better stop spinning that yarn to not green be 
not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick i rayther guess be done brown 
if that ere harpooneer hears you a his head break it for him said i 
now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the broke said he 
said broke do you mean and the very reason he sell it i guess said 
i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a snow stop whittling 
you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to 
your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half 
a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer 
whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and 
exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you 
design for my sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in 
the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who 
and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to 
spend the night with him and in the first place you will be so good 
as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to 
be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and no idea of sleeping with 
a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induce 
me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution said 
the landlord fetching a long breath a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips 
a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have 
been you of has just arrived from the south seas where he bought up a 
lot of new zealand heads great curios you know and sold all on but one 
and that one trying to sell to night cause to sunday and it would not 
do to be human heads about the streets when folks is to churches he wanted 
to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was out of the door 
with four heads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of 
inions this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after 
all had had no idea of fooling at the same time what could i think 
of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath 
engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators upon it 
landlord that harpooneer is a dangerous man pays was the rejoinder come getting dreadful late 
you had better be turning a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere 
bed the night we were spliced plenty of room for two to kick about in 
that bed an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used 
to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got 
a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor 
and came near breaking his arm arter that sal said it do come along here 
give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and 
held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking 
at a clock in the corner he exclaimed vum see that harpooneer to night come 
to anchor along then do come ye come i considered the matter a moment and 
then up stairs we went and i was ushered into a small room cold as 
a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for 
any four harpooneers to sleep abreast said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy 
old sea chest that did double duty as a wash stand and centre table make 
yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed 
but he had disappeared folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none 
of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round 
the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging 
to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing 
a man striking a whale of things not properly belonging to the room there was 
a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large 
bag containing the wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there was 
a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire place and 
a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed but what is this on 
the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt 
it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion 
concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at 
the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian 
moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as you 
see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible that any sober 
harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the streets of any christian town 
in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed 
me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little 
damp as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i 
went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i 
never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in 
such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck i sat down 
on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this head peddling harpooneer and 
his door mat after thinking some time on the bed side i got up and 
took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking 
i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves 
but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as i was and remembering what 
the landlord said about the not coming home at all that night it being so 
very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots 
and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care 
of heaven whether that mattress was stuffed with corn cobs or broken crockery there is 
no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a 
long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly 
made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall 
in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under 
the door lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal head 
peddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken 
to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the 
other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle 
a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began 
working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as 
being in the room i was all eagerness to see his face but he kept 
it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the mouth this accomplished however he 
turned good heavens what a sight such a face it was of a dark purplish 
yellow colour here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares yes just as 
i thought a terrible bedfellow been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he 
is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face 
so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be sticking plasters at 
all those black squares on his cheeks they were stains of some sort or other 
at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of 
the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white whaleman falling among 
the cannibals had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course 
of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it 
thought i after all only his outside a man can be honest in any sort 
of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it 
i mean lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing to be 
sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never 
heard of a hot tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i 
had never been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary 
effects upon the skin now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning 
this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty having opened his bag 
he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a 
seal skin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the 
middle of the room he then took the new zealand ghastly thing crammed it down 
into the bag he now took off his new beaver i came nigh singing out 
with fresh surprise there was no hair on his to speak of at but a 
small scalp knot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for 
all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and 
the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a 
dinner even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but 
it was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of 
this head peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear 
and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as 
much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken 
into my room at the dead of night in fact i was so afraid of 
him that i was not game enough just then to address him and demand a 
satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him meanwhile he continued the business of undressing 
and at last showed his chest and arms as i live these covered parts of 
him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all 
over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty war and 
just escaped from it with a sticking plaster shirt still more his very legs were 
marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of 
young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or 
other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas and so landed in this 
christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of heads the heads of 
his own brothers he might take a fancy to look at that tomahawk but there 
was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated 
my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his 
heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he 
fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a 
hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three old congo baby remembering 
the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real 
baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it was not at all limber 
and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must 
be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the 
savage goes up to the empty fire place and removing the papered fire board sets 
up this little hunch backed image like a tenpin between the andirons the chimney jambs 
and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this fire place 
made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol i now screwed 
my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease see what 
was next to follow first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of 
his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of 
ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings 
into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the fire and still hastier 
withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last 
succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little 
he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil 
did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved 
his lips all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the 
devotee who seemed to be praying in a sing song or else singing some pagan 
psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at 
last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again 
in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead 
woodcock all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms 
of concluding his business operations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was 
high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell 
in which i had so long been bound but the interval i spent in deliberating 
what to say was a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he 
examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light 
with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the 
next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang 
into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving 
a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me stammering out something i knew not 
what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or 
whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the 
lamp again but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended 
my meaning e debel you at last no speak e dam me i kill e 
and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark for sake 
peter coffin shouted i watch coffin angels save me e tell ee me who ee 
be or dam me i kill e again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings 
of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen 
would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the 
room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him be 
afraid now said he grinning again here harm a hair of your head your grinning 
shouted i why you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal thought ye 
it i tell ye he was a heads around town turn flukes again and go 
to sleep queequeg look sabbee me i this man sleepe sabbee sabbee queequeg puffing away 
at his pipe and sitting up in bed gettee in he added motioning to me 
with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in 
not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at 
him a moment for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely 
looking cannibal all this fuss i have been making about thought i to a human 
being just as i am he has just as much reason to fear me as 
i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a 
drunken christian said i him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you 
call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with 
him but i fancy having a man smoking in bed with me dangerous besides i 
insured this being told to queequeg he at once complied and again politely motioned me 
to get into over to one side as much as to touch a leg of 
ye night landlord said i may go i turned in and never slept better in 
my life chapter 4 the counterpane upon waking next morning about daylight i found arm 
thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost thought i 
had been his wife the counterpane was of patchwork full of odd little parti coloured 
squares and triangles and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan 
labyrinth of a figure no two parts of which were of one precise i suppose 
to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeves 
irregularly rolled up at various same arm of his i say looked for all the 
world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it as 
the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt 
they so blended their hues together and it was only by the sense of weight 
and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me my sensations were strange 
let me try to explain them when i was a child i well remember a 
somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream i 
never could entirely settle the circumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper 
or think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a 
little sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other was 
all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless mother dragged me by 
the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it was 
only two in the afternoon of the 21st june the longest day in the year 
in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there was no help for it so up 
stairs i went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself as slowly 
as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the 
sheets i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could 
hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the small of my back ached to 
think of it and it was so light too the sun shining in at the 
window and a great rattling of coaches in the streets and the sound of gay 
voices all over the house i felt worse and last i got up dressed and 
softly going down in my stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself 
at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering 
for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length 
of time but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers and back i 
had to go to my room for several hours i lay there broad awake feeling 
a great deal worse than i have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent 
misfortunes at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and 
slowly waking from steeped in opened my eyes and the before sun lit room was 
now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame 
nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand 
seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent 
form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bed side 
for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with the most awful 
fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could 
but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not 
how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i 
shudderingly remembered it all and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself 
in confounding attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle 
myself with it now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the 
supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced 
on waking up and seeing pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the 
past events soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only 
alive to the comical predicament for though i tried to move his his bridegroom sleeping 
as he was he still hugged me tightly as though naught but death should part 
us twain i now strove to rouse his only answer was a snore i then 
rolled over my neck feeling as if it were in a horse collar and suddenly 
felt a slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the 
side as if it were a hatchet faced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i 
abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a 
tomahawk the name of goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and 
loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that 
matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back 
his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and 
sat up in bed stiff as a pike staff looking at me and rubbing his 
eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though 
a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him meanwhile i 
lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings now and bent upon narrowly observing so 
curious a creature when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of 
his bedfellow and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out 
upon the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if 
it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving 
the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequeg under the circumstances this is a very 
civilized overture but the truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say 
what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this particular 
compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i 
was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his 
toilette motions for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a 
man like queequeg you see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual 
regarding he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one 
by the by and minus his hunted up his boots what under the heavens he 
did it for i cannot tell but his next movement was to crush in hand 
and hat the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred he was 
hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard 
of is any man required to be private when putting on his boots but queequeg 
do you see was a creature in the transition caterpillar nor butterfly he was just 
enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners his education was 
not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree 
civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all but then 
if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting 
under the bed to put them on at last he emerged with his hat very 
much dented and crushed down over his eyes and began creaking and limping about the 
room as if not being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide 
not made to order pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a 
bitter cold morning seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that 
the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room 
and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made staving about with little 
else but his hat and boots on i begged him as well as i could 
to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as 
possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the morning 
any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with 
restricting his ablutions to his chest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and 
taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash stand centre table dipped it 
into water and commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept 
his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner slips 
out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot 
and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorous scraping 
or rather harpooning of his cheeks thinks i queequeg this is using best cutlery with 
a vengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know 
of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp 
the long straight edges are always kept the rest of his toilet was soon achieved 
and he proudly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot monkey 
jacket and sporting his harpoon like a baton chapter 5 breakfast i quickly followed suit 
and descending into the bar room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no 
malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the 
matter of my bedfellow however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather 
too scarce a good thing the the pity so if any one man in his 
own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be 
backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way 
and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more 
in that man than you perhaps think for the bar room was now full of 
the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous and whom i had not 
as yet had a good look at they were nearly all whalemen chief mates and 
second mates and third mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and 
harpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an unshorn shaggy 
set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns you could pretty plainly tell how long 
each one had been ashore this young healthy cheek is like a sun toasted pear 
in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three 
days landed from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shades lighter 
you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the complexion of 
a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless has tarried 
whole weeks ashore but who could show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various 
tints seemed like the western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates zone 
by zone ho now cried the landlord flinging open a door and in we went 
to breakfast they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at 
ease in manner quite self possessed in company not always though ledyard the great new 
england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least 
assurance in the parlor but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn 
by dogs as ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty 
stomach in the negro heart of africa which was the sum of poor kind of 
travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social 
polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere 
these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated 
at the table and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling to 
my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence and not only that 
but they looked embarrassed yes here were a set of sea dogs many of whom 
without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high strangers to duelled them 
dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast of the same 
calling all of kindred round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never 
been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains a curious sight these 
bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen but as for queequeg sat there among the head 
of the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure 
i cannot say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified 
his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching 
over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the 
beefsteaks towards him but that was certainly very coolly done by him and every one 
knows that in most estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly we 
will not speak of all peculiarities here how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls and 
applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks done rare enough that when breakfast was over he 
withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawk pipe and was sitting 
there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i sallied out for 
a stroll chapter 6 the street if i had been astonished at first catching a 
glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a 
civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets 
of new bedford in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequently offer to 
view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean 
mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies regent street is not unknown to lascars and 
malays and at bombay in the apollo green live yankees have often scared the natives 
but new bedford beats all water street and wapping in these last mentioned haunts you 
see only sailors but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners savages 
outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh it makes a stranger 
stare but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimens 
of the whaling craft which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights 
still more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town scores of green 
vermonters and new hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery they 
are mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests and now seek to 
drop the axe and snatch the whale lance many are as green as the green 
mountains whence they came in some things you would think them but a few hours 
old look there that chap strutting round the corner he wears a beaver hat and 
swallow tailed coat girdled with a sailor belt and sheath knife here comes another with 
a wester and a bombazine cloak no town bred dandy will compare with a country 
bred mean a downright bumpkin fellow that in the dog days will mow his two 
acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands now when a country dandy 
like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the 
great whale fishery you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport 
in bespeaking his sea outfit he orders bell buttons to his waistcoats straps to his 
canvas trowsers ah poor hay seed how bitterly will burst those straps in the first 
howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and all down the throat of the 
tempest but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and bumpkins to 
show her visitors not at all still new bedford is a queer place had it 
not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been 
in as howling condition as the coast of labrador as it is parts of her 
back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony the town itself is 
perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england it is a land 
of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn and wine 
the streets do not run with milk nor in the spring time do they pave 
them with fresh eggs yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will you 
find more patrician like houses parks and gardens more opulent than in new bedford whence 
came they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country go and gaze 
upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion and your question will be answered 
yes all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic pacific and indian 
oceans one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of 
the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that in new bedford fathers they 
say give whales for dowers to their daughters and portion off their nieces with a 
few porpoises a piece you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding 
for they say they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly 
burn their lengths in spermaceti candles in summer time the town is sweet to see 
full of fine avenues of green and gold and in august high in air the 
beautiful and bountiful horse chestnuts candelabra wise proffer the passer by their tapering upright cones 
of congregated blossoms so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford 
has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at final 
day and the women of new bedford they bloom like their own red roses but 
roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as 
sunlight in the seventh heavens elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye cannot save in 
salem where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell 
them miles off shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of 
the puritanic sands chapter 7 the chapel in this same new bedford there stands a 
chapel and few are the moody fishermen shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific 
who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot i am sure that i 
did not returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this special 
errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist wrapping 
myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my way against 
the stubborn storm entering i found a small scattered congregation of sailors and wives and 
widows a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm 
each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other as if each silent grief 
were insular and incommunicable the chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands 
of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders masoned into 
the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran something like the following 
but i do not pretend to quote sacred to the memory of john talbot who 
at the age of eighteen was lost overboard near the isle of desolation off patagonia 
november 1 st 1836 this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister sacred 
to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman walter canny seth macy and 
samuel gleig forming one of the crews of the ship eliza who were towed out 
of sight by a whale on the off shore ground in the pacific december 31 
st 1839 this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates sacred to the memory 
of the late captain ezekiel hardy who in the bows of his boat was killed 
by a sperm whale on the coast of japan august 3 d 1833 this tablet 
is erected to his memory by his widow shaking off the sleet from my ice 
glazed hat and jacket i seated myself near the door and turning sideways was surprised 
to see queequeg near me affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a 
wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage was the only person present 
who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only one who could not 
read and therefore was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall whether any of 
the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation i 
knew not but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly 
did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief 
that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose unhealing hearts 
the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh oh 
ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flowers can here 
lies my beloved ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these what 
bitter blanks in those black bordered marbles which cover no ashes what despair in those 
immovable inscriptions what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw 
upon all faith and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a 
grave as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here in 
what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included why it is that 
a universal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though containing more secrets 
than the goodwin sands how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for 
the other world we prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not 
thus entitle him if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth 
why the life insurance companies pay death forfeitures upon immortals in what eternal unstirring paralysis 
and deadly hopeless trance yet lies antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago how 
it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain 
are dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all the 
dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole 
city all these things are not without their meanings but faith like a jackal feeds 
among the tombs and even from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope 
it needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a nantucket 
voyage i regarded those marble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened doleful 
day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me yes ishmael the 
same fate may be thine but somehow i grew merry again delightful inducements to embark 
fine chance for promotion it a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet 
yes there is death in this business of speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man 
into eternity but what then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and 
death methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance 
methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the 
sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air methinks my 
body is but the lees of my better being in fact take my body who 
will take it i say it is not me and therefore three cheers for nantucket 
and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul 
jove himself cannot chapter 8 the pulpit i had not been seated very long ere 
a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately as the storm pelted door flew 
back upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently 
attested that this fine old man was the chaplain yes it was the famous father 
mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favourite he 
had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth but for many years past 
had dedicated his life to the ministry at the time i now write of father 
mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old 
age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of 
his wrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing spring verdure peeping forth 
even beneath snow no one having previously heard his history could for the first time 
behold father mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about 
him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed 
that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his 
tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost 
to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed 
however hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up in 
a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly 
approached the pulpit like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and 
since a regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the 
floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect it seemed had 
acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the pulpit without a stairs substituting 
a perpendicular side ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at 
sea the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair 
of red worsted man ropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained 
with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed 
by no means in bad taste halting for an instant at the foot of the 
ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man ropes father mapple 
cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailor like but still reverential dexterity 
hand over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the main top of his vessel 
the perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with swinging ones 
were of cloth covered rope only the rounds were of wood so that at every 
step there was a joint at my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not 
escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joints in the present instance seemed 
unnecessary for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly 
turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step 
till the whole was deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little quebec i pondered 
some time without fully comprehending the reason for this father mapple enjoyed such a wide 
reputation for sincerity and sanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by 
any mere tricks of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason 
for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be then that by 
that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all 
outward worldly ties and connexions yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the 
word to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a self containing 
lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls but the side ladder 
was not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the former sea farings 
between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its 
back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible 
storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers but high above the 
flying scud and dark rolling clouds there floated a little isle of sunlight from which 
beamed forth an face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon 
the tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the plank where nelson 
fell noble ship the angel seemed to say on beat on thou noble ship and 
bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling 
azure is at hand nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same 
sea taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in 
the likeness of a bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece 
of scroll work fashioned after a fiddle headed beak what could be more full of 
meaning the pulpit is ever this foremost part all the rest comes in its rear 
the pulpit leads the world from thence it is the storm of quick wrath is 
first descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is the 
god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds yes the a 
ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is its 
prow chapter 9 the sermon father mapple rose and in a mild voice of unassuming 
authority ordered the scattered people to condense gangway there side away to gangway to starboard 
midships midships there was a low rumbling of heavy sea boots among the benches and 
a still slighter shuffling of shoes and all was quiet again and every eye on 
the preacher he paused a little then kneeling in the bows folded his large brown 
hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered a prayer so deeply devout 
that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea this ended in 
prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is 
foundering at sea in a such tones he commenced reading the following hymn but changing 
his manner towards the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and ribs and 
terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all sun lit waves 
rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom saw the opening maw of hell 
with endless pains and sorrows there which none but they that feel can oh i 
was plunging to despair black distress i called my god when i could scarce believe 
him mine he bowed his ear to my no more the whale did me confine 
speed he flew to my relief as on a radiant dolphin borne awful yet bright 
as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god song for ever shall record that 
terrible that joyful hour i give the glory to my god his all the mercy 
and the power nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the 
howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaves 
of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said 
shipmates clinch the last verse of the first chapter of god had prepared a great 
fish to swallow up jonah this book containing only four one of the smallest strands 
in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what depths of the soul does deep 
sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing 
is that canticle in the belly how billow like and boisterously grand we feel the 
floods surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters 
sea weed and all the slime of the sea is about us but what is 
this lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a two stranded lesson 
a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a 
pilot of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all 
because it is a story of the sin hard heartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift 
punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah as with all sinners 
among men the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of 
the command of mind now what that command was or how he found a hard 
command but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us 
to hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade and if we obey god 
we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of 
obeying god consists this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at god 
by seeking to flee from him he thinks that a ship made by men will 
carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains of this 
earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship bound for tarshish 
there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been 
no other city than the modern cadiz the opinion of learned men and where is 
cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa as jonah could 
possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea 
because joppa the modern jaffa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean 
the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from 
that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye not then shipmates that jonah sought 
to flee world wide from god miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all 
scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the shipping 
like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered self condemning is his 
look that had there been policemen in those days jonah on the mere suspicion of 
something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly a fugitive no 
baggage not a hat box valise or carpet bag friends accompany him to the wharf 
with their adieux at last after much dodging search he finds the tarshish ship receiving 
the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its 
captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the 
goods to mark the evil eye jonah sees this but in vain he tries to 
look all ease and confidence in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the 
man assure the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious 
way one whispers to the robbed a widow or do you mark him a bigamist 
or lad i guess the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one 
of the missing murderers from sodom another runs to read the bill stuck against the 
spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coins 
for the apprehension of a parricide and containing a description of his person he reads 
and looks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round 
jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah trembles and summoning all his 
boldness to his face only looks so much the more a coward he will not 
confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion so he makes the best of 
it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised 
they let him pass and he descends into the cabin there cries the captain at 
his busy desk hurriedly making out his papers for the there oh how that harmless 
question mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again but he rallies 
seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir thus far 
the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stands before 
him but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing 
glance sail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing 
him sooner sir enough for any honest man that goes a passenger ha jonah another 
stab but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent sail with ye says 
passage money how much is that pay now for it is particularly written shipmates as 
if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history he paid the 
fare ere the craft did sail and taken with the context this is full of 
meaning captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime in any but whose cupidity exposes 
it only in the penniless in this world shipmates sin that pays its way can 
travel freely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all 
frontiers so captain prepares to test the length of purse ere he judge him openly 
he charges him thrice the usual sum and assented to then the captain knows that 
jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that 
paves its rear with gold yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions 
still molest the captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger 
any way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage out my state 
room sir says jonah now travel weary i need sleep lookest like it says the 
captain thy room jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no 
key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something 
about the doors of cells being never allowed to be locked within all dressed and 
dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little state 
room ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasps then 
in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the water line jonah feels the heralding presentiment 
of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his 
wards at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in room and 
the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received 
the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with 
reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the 
false lying levels among which it hung the lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying 
in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successful 
fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more 
and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry so 
my conscience hangs in me he groans upwards so it burns but the chambers of 
my soul are all in crookedness one who after a night of drunken revelry hies 
to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of 
the roman race horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him 
as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish praying 
god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of 
woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the man who bleeds 
to death for conscience is the wound and naught to staunch it so after sore 
wrestlings in his berth prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep now 
the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and from the 
deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening glides to sea that ship my 
friends was the first of recorded smugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels 
he will not bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is 
like to break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when 
boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men 
are yelling and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over head in all this 
raging tumult jonah sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea 
feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush 
of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after 
him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the berth in the 
cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the frightened master comes 
to him and shrieks in his dead ear meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from 
his lethargy by that direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the 
deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he 
is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave after wave thus 
leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till 
the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat and ever as the white moon 
shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees 
the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep 
upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his cringing attitudes the god fugitive 
is now too plainly known the sailors mark him more and more certain grow their 
suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole 
matter to high heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this 
great tempest was upon them the lot is that discovered then how furiously they mob 
him with their questions is thine occupation whence comest thou thy country what people but 
mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor jonah the eager mariners but ask him 
who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those 
questions but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited 
answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him 
am a hebrew he fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the 
sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well mightest thou fear the 
lord god then straightway he now goes on to make a full confession whereupon the 
mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet 
supplicating god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts 
wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the 
sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them they 
mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship but all 
in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raised invokingly to god 
with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah now behold jonah taken up 
as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness floats out 
from the east and the sea is still as jonah carries down the gale with 
him leaving smooth water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a 
masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning 
jaws awaiting him and the whale shoots to all his ivory teeth like so many 
white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the belly 
but observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah 
does not weep and wail for direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is 
just he leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of 
all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy temple and here 
shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and 
how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance 
of him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before 
you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as 
a model for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of 
it like jonah while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting 
storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing sea storm 
seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved as with a ground swell 
his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away 
from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his 
simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them there 
now came a lull in his look as he silently turned over the leaves of 
the book once more and at last standing motionless with closed eyes for the moment 
seemed communing with god and himself but again he leaned over towards the people and 
bowing his head lowly with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility he spake 
these words god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press upon 
me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that 
jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for 
i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down 
from this mast head and sit on the hatches there where you sit and listen 
as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more awful 
lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god how being 
an anointed pilot prophet or speaker of true things and bidden by the lord to 
sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the 
hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and 
his god by taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached 
as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down 
to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along the midst of 
the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and weeds were 
wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet 
even then beyond the reach of any of the belly of the whale grounded upon 
the utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried then 
god spake unto the fish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea 
the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights 
of air and earth and out jonah upon the dry land when the word of 
the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and ears like two sea shells 
still multitudinously murmuring of the did the bidding and what was that shipmates to preach 
the truth to the face of falsehood that was it shipmates this is that other 
lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it woe to 
him whom this world charms from gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour 
oil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale woe to him 
who seeks to please rather than to appal woe to him whose good name is 
more to him than goodness woe to him who in this world courts not dishonor 
woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation 
yea woe to him who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to 
others is himself a castaway he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment 
then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as 
he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm oh shipmates on the starboard hand of every 
woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the 
bottom of the woe is deep is not the main truck higher than the kelson 
is low delight is to far far upward and inward against the proud gods and 
commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to him 
whose strong arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has 
gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth 
and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the 
robes of senators and judges delight gallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law 
or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven delight 
is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the 
boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight 
and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his 
final father known to me by thy or immortal here i die i have striven 
to be thine more than to be this or mine own yet this is nothing 
i leave eternity to thee for what is man that he should live out the 
lifetime of his god he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his 
face with his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and 
he was left alone in the place chapter 10 a bosom friend returning to the 
spouter inn from the chapel i found queequeg there quite alone he having left the 
chapel before the benediction some time he was sitting on a bench before the fire 
with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up 
to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and 
with a jack knife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in 
his heathenish way but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon 
going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his 
lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth i a moment looking 
vacantly around him and giving utterance to a long drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he 
would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each 
time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was only by 
such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude 
of pages was excited with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was 
and hideously marred about the least to my countenance yet had a something in it 
which was by no means disagreeable you cannot hide the soul through all his unearthly 
tattooings i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his 
large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would 
dare a thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing about 
the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim he looked like a man 
who had never cringed and never had had a creditor whether it was too that 
his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and 
looked more expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but 
certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous but 
it reminded me of general head as seen in the popular busts of him it 
had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewise 
very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington cannibalistically 
developed whilst i was thus closely scanning him half pretending meanwhile to be looking out 
at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with 
so much as a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of 
the marvellous book considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and 
especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the 
morning i thought this indifference of his very strange but savages are strange beings at 
times you do not know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing 
their calm self collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed also that 
queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seamen in the 
inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle 
of his acquaintances all this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there 
was something almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand miles from 
home by the way of cape horn that was the only way he could get 
among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter and 
yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own 
companionship always equal to himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no 
doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that but perhaps to 
be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving 
so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out for 
a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have his digester 
as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that 
mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then only glows 
to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements and peering 
in upon us silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells i began 
to be sensible of strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my 
splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing savage had 
redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked 
no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits wild he was a very sight of sights to 
see yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things 
that would have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me 
try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy i 
drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing my best 
to talk with him meanwhile at first he little noticed these advances but presently upon 
my referring to his last hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were 
again to be bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps 
a little complimented we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain 
to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that 
were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to 
jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this 
famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he 
quietly offered me a puff and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe 
of his and keeping it regularly passing between us if there yet lurked any ice 
of indifference towards me in the breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed 
it out and left us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally 
and unbiddenly as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his 
forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married 
meaning in his phrase that we were bosom friends he would gladly die for me 
if need should be in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed 
far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those 
old rules would not apply after supper and another social chat and smoke we went 
to our room together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out 
his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollars in 
silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions 
pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine i was going to 
remonstrate but he silenced me by pouring them into my pockets i let them stay 
he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper 
fireboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed anxious for me to join 
him but well knowing what was to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case 
he invited me i would comply or otherwise i was a good christian born and 
bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church how then could i unite with 
this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i 
do you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and and all possibly 
be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worship do 
the will of that is worship and what is the will of god do to 
my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to that is 
the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish 
that this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular presbyterian 
form of worship consequently i must then unite with him in his ergo i must 
turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol offered 
him burnt biscuit with queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and 
that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences and 
all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat how 
it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential 
disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their 
souls to each other and some old couples often lie and chat over old times 
till nearly morning thus then in our honeymoon lay i and cosy loving pair chapter 
11 nightgown we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and 
queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine and then drawing 
them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by 
reason of our confabulations what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt 
like getting up again though day break was yet some way down the future yes 
we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome 
and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around 
us leaning against the head board with our four knees drawn up close together and 
our two noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warming pans we felt 
very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors 
indeed out of bed clothes too seeing that there was no fire in the room 
the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of 
you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not 
what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if you flatter yourself that 
you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot 
be said to be comfortable any more but if like queequeg and me in the 
bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled 
why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for 
this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one 
of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height of this sort of deliciousness 
is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold 
of the outer air then there you lie like the one warm spark in the 
heart of an arctic crystal we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some 
time when all at once i thought i would open my eyes for when between 
sheets whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a 
way of always keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness 
of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except 
his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences 
though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon opening my eyes then and 
coming out of my own pleasant and self created darkness into the imposed and coarse 
outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve at night i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did 
i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to 
strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a 
strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk be it said that 
though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the 
night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to 
bend them for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me 
even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then 
i no more felt unduly concerned for the policy of insurance i was only alive 
to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real 
friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed the tomahawk from 
one to the other till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of 
smoke illuminated by the flame of the new lit lamp whether it was that this 
undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes i know not but he 
now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him 
to go on and tell it he gladly complied though at the time i but 
ill comprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become 
more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such 
as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give chapter 12 biographical queequeg was 
a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and south it is 
not down in any map true places never are when a new hatched savage running 
wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as 
if he were a green sapling even then in ambitious soul lurked a strong desire 
to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his father was 
a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal side 
he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors there was excellent blood in 
his stuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his 
untutored youth a sag harbor ship visited his bay and queequeg sought a passage to 
christian lands but the ship having her full complement of seamen spurned his suit and 
not all the king his influence could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in 
his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must 
pass through when she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on 
the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into 
the water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its prow seaward he 
sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding 
by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of 
his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himself at 
full length upon the deck grappled a ring bolt there and swore not to let 
it go though hacked in pieces in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard 
suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and 
queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit christendom 
the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home but 
this fine young sea prince of wales never saw the cabin they put him down 
among the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to 
toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he 
might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen for at he told was 
actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to make 
his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they 
were but alas the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be 
both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his heathens arrived at last in 
old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on to 
nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also poor queequeg gave 
it up for lost thought he a wicked world in all meridians die a pagan 
and thus an old idolator at heart he yet lived among these christians wore their 
clothes and tried to talk their gibberish hence the queer ways about him though now 
some time from home by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going 
back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone 
he being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet 
and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had unfitted him for ascending 
the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him but by and by 
he said he would return soon as he felt himself baptized again for the nonce 
however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans 
they had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of 
a sceptre now i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future 
movements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon this i 
told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to 
sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to 
embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the 
same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me 
in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldly dip 
into the potluck of both worlds to all this i joyously assented for besides the 
affection i now felt for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could 
not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant 
of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as known to merchant 
seamen his story being ended with his last dying puff queequeg embraced me pressed his 
forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this 
way and that and very soon were sleeping chapter 13 wheelbarrow next morning monday after 
disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block i settled my own 
and bill using however my money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed 
amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and as peter 
cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very 
person whom i now companied with we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including 
my own poor carpet bag and canvas sack and hammock away we went down to 
moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf as we were going along 
the people stared not at queequeg so they were used to seeing cannibals like him 
in their streets at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we heeded 
them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg now and then stopping 
to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked him why he carried such 
a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their 
own harpoons to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted was true 
enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of 
assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts 
of whales in short like many inland reapers and mowers who go into the meadows 
armed with their own in no wise obliged to furnish so queequeg for his own 
private reasons preferred his own harpoon shifting the barrow from my hand to his he 
told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was 
in sag harbor the owners of his ship it seems had lent him one in 
which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about 
the in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage 
the puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and 
marches up the wharf said i you might have known better than that one would 
think the people laugh upon this he told me another story the people of his 
island of rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young 
cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the 
great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held now a certain 
grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko and its all accounts a very stately punctilious 
gentleman at least for a sea commander was invited to the wedding feast of sister 
a pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding guests were 
assembled at the bamboo cottage this captain marches in and being assigned the post of 
honor placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty 
the king father grace being said those people have their grace as well as queequeg 
told me that unlike us who at such times look downwards to our platters they 
on the contrary copying the ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all i 
say being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the 
island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed 
beverage circulates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking captain 
of a having plain precedence over a mere island king especially in the own captain 
coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl it i suppose for a huge 
finger glass said queequeg you tink now our people laugh at last passage paid and 
luggage safe we stood on board the schooner hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet 
river on one side new bedford rose in terraces of streets their ice covered trees 
all glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of casks on casks 
were piled upon her wharves and side by side the world wandering whale ships lay 
silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenters and 
coopers with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch all betokening that 
new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only 
begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for 
ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly effort 
gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little moss tossed the 
quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings how i snuffed that 
tartar air i spurned that turnpike earth common highway all over dented with the marks 
of slavish heels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea 
which will permit no records at the same foam fountain queequeg seemed to drink and 
reel with me his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth 
on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the blast 
ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways leaning we sideways 
darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall masts buckling like indian canes 
in land tornadoes so full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by 
the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of 
the passengers a lubber like assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so 
companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro but 
there were some boobies and bumpkins there who by their intense greenness must have come 
from the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings 
mimicking him behind his back i thought the hour of doom was come dropping his 
harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity 
and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern 
in mid somerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning 
his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a 
puff capting yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer capting the devil you sir cried 
the captain a gaunt rib of the sea stalking up to queequeg in thunder do 
you mean by that you know you might have killed that chap him say said 
queequeg as he mildly turned to me say said i you came near kill e 
that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn e cried queequeg twisting his tattooed 
face into an unearthly expression of disdain him bevy small e fish e queequeg no 
kill e so small e fish e queequeg kill e big whale you roared the 
captain kill e you you cannibal if you try any more of your tricks aboard 
here so mind your eye but it so happened just then that it was high 
time for the captain to mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the main 
sail had parted the weather sheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side 
to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor fellow whom 
queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and 
to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness it flew from right 
to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant 
seemed on the point of snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable 
of being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom 
as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the midst of 
this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the 
boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then flinging 
the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his 
head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was 
safe the schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away 
the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long 
living arc of a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like 
a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing his 
brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but 
saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from 
the water queequeg now took an glance around him and seeming to see just how 
matters were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again one 
arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form the boat soon 
picked them up the poor bumpkin was restored all hands voted queequeg a noble trump 
the captain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle 
yea till poor queequeg took his last long dive was there ever such unconsciousness he 
did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane 
and magnanimous societies he only asked for to wipe the brine off that done he 
put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwarks and mildly eyeing 
those around him seemed to be saying to a mutual joint stock world in all 
meridians we cannibals must help these christians chapter 14 nantucket nothing more happened on the 
passage worthy the mentioning so after a fine run we safely arrived in nantucket nantucket 
take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of the 
world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely than the eddystone 
lighthouse look at mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background there 
is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for 
blotting paper some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there 
they grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have to send beyond seas 
for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood 
in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome that people 
there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summer time that 
one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a walk a prairie that 
they wear quicksand shoes something like laplander snow shoes that they are so shut up 
belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean 
that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as 
to the backs of sea turtles but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no 
illinois look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by 
the red men thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle swooped down upon 
the new england coast and carried off an infant indian in his talons with loud 
lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters they 
resolved to follow in the same direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous 
passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casket poor little 
skeleton what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take to the 
sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand grown bolder 
they waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boats and 
captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored 
this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in at straits 
and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass 
that has survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan salt sea mastodon 
clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panics are more to be 
dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults and thus have these naked nantucketers these 
sea hermits issuing from their ant hill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery 
world like so many alexanders parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and indian oceans 
as the three pirate powers did poland let america add mexico to texas and pile 
cuba upon canada let the english overswarm all india and hang out their blazing banner 
from the sun two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the for the sea is 
his he owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of 
way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts even 
pirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen the road they but plunder other 
ships other fragments of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from 
the bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the sea he 
alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it 
as his own special plantation there is his home there lies his business which a 
flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on 
the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs 
them as chamois hunters climb the alps for years he knows not the land so 
that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely 
than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull that at sunset folds 
her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the nantucketer out 
of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under 
his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales chapter 15 chowder it was quite 
late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and queequeg and 
i went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none 
but a supper and a bed the landlord of the spouter inn had recommended us 
to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots whom he asserted to be the 
proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had 
assured us that cousin hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in 
short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot luck 
at the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow 
warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard and 
then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to 
the starboard and that done then ask the first man we met where the place 
was these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first especially as at 
the outset queequeg insisted that the yellow first point of be left on the larboard 
hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it was on the starboard however 
by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking 
up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which 
there was no mistaking two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by ears swung 
from the cross trees of an old top mast planted in front of an old 
doorway the horns of the cross trees were sawed off on the other side so 
that this old top mast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i was 
over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i could not help staring at 
this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of crick was in my neck as 
i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes two of them one for queequeg 
and one for me ominous thinks i a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my 
first whaling port tombstones staring at me in the chapel and here a gallows and 
a pair of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints touching 
tophet i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with 
yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a 
dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on 
a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt along with ye said 
she to the man be combing ye on queequeg said i right mrs hussey and 
so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving mrs hussey entirely 
competent to attend to all his affairs upon making known our desires for a supper 
and a bed mrs hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a 
little room and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently 
concluded repast turned round to us and or cod that about cods said i with 
much politeness or cod she repeated clam for supper a cold clam is that what 
you mean mrs hussey says i a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter 
time it mrs hussey but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man 
in the purple shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to 
hear nothing but the word mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the 
kitchen and bawling out for two disappeared said i you think that we can make 
out a supper for us both on one clam however a warm savory steam from 
the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking 
chowder came in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends hearken to me it 
was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship 
biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flakes the whole enriched with butter and 
plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and 
in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly 
excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me 
of mrs clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment stepping 
to the kitchen door i uttered the word with great emphasis and resumed my seat 
in a few moments the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor 
and in good time a fine cod chowder was placed before us we resumed business 
and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i to myself i wonder now 
if this here has any effect on the head that stultifying saying about chowder headed 
people look queequeg that a live eel in your bowl your harpoon fishiest of all 
fishy places was the try pots which well deserved its name for the pots there 
were always boiling chowders chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper 
till you began to look for fish bones coming through your clothes the area before 
the house was paved with clam shells mrs hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish 
vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark skin there 
was a fishy flavor to the milk too which i could not at all account 
for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some boats 
i saw brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each 
foot in a decapitated head looking very slip shod i assure ye supper concluded we 
received a lamp and directions from mrs hussey concerning the nearest way to bed but 
as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her 
arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers not said i 
true whaleman sleeps with his why not dangerous says she since young stiggs coming from 
that of his when he was gone four years and a half with only three 
barrels of ile was found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in 
his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in 
their rooms at night so mr for she had learned his name will just take 
this here iron and keep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or 
cod to morrow for breakfast men says i have a couple of smoked herring by 
way of variety chapter 16 the ship in bed we concocted our plans for the 
morrow but to my surprise and no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand 
that he had been diligently consulting name of his black little yojo had told him 
two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it everyway that instead of our 
going together among the whaling fleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead 
of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest 
wholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to do so 
had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infallibly 
light upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and 
in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the present irrespective of queequeg i 
have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence 
of judgment and surprising forecast of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a 
rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in 
all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs now this plan of or rather 
touching the selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all i 
had not a little relied upon sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to 
carry us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon 
queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with 
a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little 
affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little it seemed 
that it was some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and 
prayer with queequeg and yojo that day how it was i never could find out 
for though i applied myself to it several times i never could master his liturgies 
and xxxix queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his 
sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and 
many random inquiries i learnt that there were three ships up for three devil dam 
the tit bit and the pequod devil dam i do not know the origin of 
tit bit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was the name of a 
celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes i peered and pryed 
about the devil dam from her hopped over to the tit bit and finally going 
on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this 
was the very ship for us you may have seen many a quaint craft in 
your day for aught i know toed luggers mountainous japanese junks butter box galliots and 
what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old 
craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old school 
rather small if anything with an old fashioned claw footed look about her long seasoned 
and weather stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old complexion 
was darkened like a french who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable 
bows looked bearded her somewhere on the coast of japan where her original ones were 
lost overboard in a masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old 
kings of cologne her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrim worshipped flag 
stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these her old antiquities were 
added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wild business that for more than half 
a century she had followed old captain peleg many years her chief mate before he 
commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the 
principal owners of the pequod old peleg during the term of his chief mateship had 
built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of 
material and device unmatched by anything except it be thorkill carved buckler or bedstead she 
was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory 
she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in 
the chased bones of her enemies all round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like 
one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for 
pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to those thews ran not through 
base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea ivory scorning a 
turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was 
in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe 
the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when 
he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow 
a most melancholy all noble things are touched with that now when i looked about 
the quarter deck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a 
candidate for the voyage at first i saw nobody but i could not well overlook 
a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the main mast 
it seemed only a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical shape 
some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken 
from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right whale planted with 
their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped 
towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose 
hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top knot on some old pottowottamie head 
a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded 
a complete view forward and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found 
one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and 
the work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of command he was seated 
on an old fashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom 
of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which 
the wigwam was constructed there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of 
the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen and 
heavily rolled up in blue pilot cloth cut in the quaker style only there was 
a fine and almost microscopic net work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes 
which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking 
to windward this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together such eye 
wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl this the captain of the pequod said i 
advancing to the door of the tent it be the captain of the pequod what 
dost thou want of him he demanded was thinking of shipping wast wast thou i 
see thou art no been in a stove boat sir i never have know nothing 
at all about whaling i dare sir but i have no doubt i shall soon 
learn been several voyages in the merchant service and i think service be damned talk 
not that lingo to me dost see that leg take that leg away from thy 
stern if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed 
i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships but 
flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling eh looks a little suspicious 
it eh not been a pirate hast thou not rob thy last captain didst thou 
not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea i protested my innocence 
of these things i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes this 
old seaman as an insulated quakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather 
distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard what takes 
thee a whaling i want to know that before i think of shipping ye sir 
i want to see what whaling is i want to see the world to see 
what whaling is eh have ye clapped eye on captain ahab is captain ahab sir 
aye i thought so captain ahab is the captain of this ship am mistaken then 
i thought i was speaking to the captain himself art speaking to captain who ye 
are speaking to young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the 
pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we 
are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest 
to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in 
a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out 
clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only 
one leg do you mean sir was the other one lost by a whale by 
a whale young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed up crunched by 
the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat ah i was a little alarmed by 
his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation 
but said as calmly as i could you say is no doubt true enough sir 
but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though 
indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident ye 
now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft see thou dost not talk 
shark a bit sure been to sea before now sure of that said i thought 
i told you that i had been four voyages in the down out of that 
mind what i said about the marchant aggravate have it but let us understand each 
other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel 
inclined for it do sir good now art thou the man to pitch a harpoon 
down a live throat and then jump after it answer quick am sir if it 
should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is 
which i take to be the fact again now then thou not only wantest to 
go a whaling to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also want 
to go in order to see the world was not that what ye said i 
thought so well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weather 
bow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there for a 
moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to 
take it whether humorously or in earnest but concentrating all his feet into one scowl 
captain peleg started me on the errand going forward and glancing over the weather bow 
i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood tide was now 
obliquely pointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding 
not the slightest variety that i could see the report said peleg when i came 
back did ye see much i but water considerable horizon though and a squall coming 
up i think what does thou think then of seeing the world do ye wish 
to go round cape horn to see any more of it eh ye see the 
world where you stand i was a little staggered but go a whaling i must 
and i would and the pequod was as good a ship as thought the all 
this i now repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to 
ship me thou mayest as well sign the papers right off he along with ye 
and so saying he led the way below deck into the cabin seated on the 
transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure it turned out 
to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners 
of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being 
held by a crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning 
about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail 
or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the 
same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest now 
bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a quaker the island having been 
originally settled by that sect and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in 
an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified by things 
altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of 
all sailors and whale hunters they are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance 
so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture singularly common 
fashion on the in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the 
quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives strangely 
blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a scandinavian 
sea king or a poetical pagan roman and when these things unite in a man 
of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who has 
also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night watches in the remotest waters 
and beneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and 
independently receiving all sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding 
breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantages to learn a bold 
and nervous lofty man makes one in a whole mighty pageant creature formed for noble 
tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth 
or other circumstances he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom 
of his nature for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness 
be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but as 
yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and 
still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of 
the quaker modified by individual circumstances like captain peleg captain bildad was a well to 
do retired whaleman but unlike captain cared not a rush for what are called serious 
things and indeed deemed those self same serious things the veriest of all bildad had 
not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all 
his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creatures round the 
that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot had not so much 
as altered one angle of his vest still for all this immutableness was there some 
lack of common consistency about worthy captain bildad though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear 
arms against land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though 
a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straight bodied coat spilled 
tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his days 
the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence i do not know but it 
did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come 
to the sage and sensible conclusion that a religion is one thing and this practical 
world quite another this world pays dividends rising from a little cabin boy in short 
clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shad bellied waistcoat from 
that becoming boat header chief mate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad as 
i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at 
the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of 
his well earned income now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of 
being an incorrigible old hunks and in his sea going days a bitter hard task 
master they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when 
he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried 
ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for 
a quaker he was certainly rather hard hearted to say the least he never used 
to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity 
of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad was a chief mate to 
have his drab coloured eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till 
you could clutch hammer or a marling spike and go to work like mad at 
something or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished before him his own person 
was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his long gaunt body he carried 
no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it 
like the worn nap of his broad brimmed hat such then was the person that 
i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin 
the space between the decks was small and there bolt upright sat old bildad who 
always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broad 
brim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was buttoned 
up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a 
ponderous volume cried captain peleg it again bildad eh ye have been studying those scriptures 
now for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge how far ye got bildad 
as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate bildad without noticing 
his present irreverence quietly looked up and seeing me glanced again inquiringly towards peleg says 
our man bildad said peleg wants to ship thee said bildad in a hollow tone 
and turning round to me dost said i unconsciously he was so intense a quaker 
do ye think of him bildad said peleg do said bildad eyeing me and then 
went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible i thought 
him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg his friend and old 
shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg 
now threw open a chest and drawing forth the articles placed pen and ink before 
him and seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high 
time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for 
the voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages 
but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called lays and 
that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties 
of the company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my 
own lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the 
sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt 
that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th is 
the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually 
amount to and though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay 
yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty 
nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of 
my three beef and board for which i would not have to pay one stiver 
it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely so 
it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those that never 
take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to 
board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim sign of the 
thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the 275th lay would be about the 
fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the 200th considering 
i was of a broad shouldered make but one thing nevertheless that made me a 
little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had 
heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they 
being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered 
owners left nearly the whole management of the affairs to these two and i did 
not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say 
about shipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod quite at 
home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his own fireside 
now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack knife old 
bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was such an interested party in 
these proceedings bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himself out of his 
book lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where captain bildad interrupted peleg say 
what lay shall we give this young man knowest best was the sepulchral reply seven 
hundred and seventy seventh be too much would it moth and rust do corrupt but 
lay lay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and seventy seventh 
well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not lay up many 
lays here below where moth and rust do corrupt it was an exceedingly long lay 
that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive 
a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy seven 
is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a teenth of it 
you will then see i say that the seven hundred and seventy seventh part of 
a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy seven gold doubloons 
and so i thought at the time blast your eyes bildad cried peleg dost not 
want to swindle this young man he must have more than that hundred and seventy 
seventh again said bildad without lifting his eyes and then went on where your treasure 
is there will your heart be also am going to put him down for the 
three hundredth said peleg ye hear that bildad the three hundredth lay i say bildad 
laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said peleg thou hast a generous 
heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this 
and orphans many of that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young 
man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans the seven 
hundred and seventy seventh lay captain peleg bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about 
the cabin ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matters i 
would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to 
founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn peleg said bildad steadily conscience 
may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms i tell but as thou 
art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but 
a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery 
pit captain peleg pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye 
insult me an all fired outrage to tell any human creature that bound to hell 
flukes and flames bildad say that again to me and start my soul bolts but 
swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on out of the cabin 
ye canting drab coloured son of a wooden straight wake with ye as he thundered 
out this he made a rush at bildad but with a marvellous oblique sliding celerity 
bildad for that time eluded him alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal 
and responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all 
idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside 
from the door to give egress to bildad who i made no doubt was all 
eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he 
sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest 
intention of withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as for 
peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more left in 
him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little as 
if still nervously agitated he whistled at gone off to leeward i think bildad thou 
used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jack 
knife here needs the grindstone he thank ye bildad now then my young man thy 
name ye say well then down ye go here ishmael for the three hundredth lay 
peleg said i have a friend with me who wants to ship i bring him 
down to morrow be sure said peleg him along and look at him lay does 
he want groaned bildad glancing up from the book in which he had again been 
burying himself never thee mind about that bildad said peleg he ever whaled it any 
turning to me more whales than i can count captain peleg bring him along then 
and after signing the papers off i went nothing doubting but that i had done 
a good work and that the pequod was the identical ship that yojo had provided 
to carry queequeg and me round the cape but i had not proceeded far when 
i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet 
remained unseen by me though indeed in many cases a whale ship will be completely 
fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible 
by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shore 
intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any 
absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in 
port but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea however it 
is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into 
his hands turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab was to be 
found what dost thou want of captain ahab all right enough thou art shipped but 
i should like to see him i think thou wilt be able to at present 
i know exactly the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a 
sort of sick and yet he look so in fact he sick but no he 
well either any how young man he always see me so i suppose he will 
thee a queer man captain some a good one oh like him well enough no 
fear no fear a grand ungodly god like man captain ahab speak much but when 
he does speak then you may well listen mark ye be forewarned above the common 
been in colleges as well as the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the 
waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales his lance aye the 
keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he captain bildad no 
and he captain peleg ahab boy and ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned 
king a very vile one when that wicked king was slain the dogs did they 
not lick his blood hither to hither said peleg with a significance in his eye 
that almost startled me ye lad never say that on board the pequod never say 
it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy 
widowed mother who died when he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old 
squaw tistig at gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps other 
fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee a lie 
i know captain ahab well sailed with him as mate years ago i know what 
he good a pious good man like bildad but a swearing good like a good 
deal more of him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and 
i know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind 
for a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that 
brought that about as any one might see i know too that ever since he 
lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale been a kind of moody and 
savage sometimes but that will all pass off and once for all let me tell 
thee and assure thee young man better to sail with a moody good captain than 
a laughing bad one so good bye to wrong not captain ahab because he happens 
to have a wicked name besides my boy he has a three voyages sweet resigned 
girl think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold 
ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab no no my lad 
stricken blasted if he be ahab has his humanities as i walked away i was 
full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me 
with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time i 
felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i know what unless it 
was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange awe 
of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was not 
exactly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it 
did not disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery 
in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then however my thoughts were 
at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark ahab slipped my 
mind chapter 17 the ramadan as ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue all 
day i did not choose to disturb him till towards night fall for i cherish 
the greatest respect towards religious obligations never mind how comical and could not find it 
in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad stool or 
those other creatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of footmanism 
quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor 
merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name i 
say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things and not fancy ourselves 
so vastly superior to other mortals pagans and what not because of their half crazy 
conceits on these subjects there was queequeg now certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about 
yojo and his ramadan what of that queequeg thought he knew what he was about 
i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest all our arguing 
with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on 
us and pagans we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need 
mending towards evening when i felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be 
over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer 
i tried to open it but it was fastened inside said i softly through the 
key hole silent say queequeg why you speak but all remained still as before i 
began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant time i thought he might 
have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the key hole but the door opening 
into an odd corner of the room the key hole prospect was but a crooked 
and sinister one i could only see part of the foot board of the bed 
and a line of the wall but nothing more i was surprised to behold resting 
against the wall the wooden shaft of harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had 
taken from him before our mounting to the chamber strange thought i but at any 
rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it 
therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake still something must have happened 
apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted running down stairs 
i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i chamber maid la she cried 
thought something must be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and 
the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and been just so 
silent ever since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked 
your baggage in for safe keeping la la murder mrs hussey apoplexy with these cries 
she ran towards the kitchen i following mrs hussey soon appeared with a mustard pot 
in one hand and a vinegar cruet in the other having just broken away from 
the occupation of attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy meantime house 
cried i way to it run for sake and fetch something to pry open the 
axe axe had a stroke depend upon it so saying i was unmethodically rushing up 
stairs again empty handed when mrs hussey interposed the mustard pot and vinegar cruet and 
the entire castor of her countenance the matter with you young man the axe for 
sake run for the doctor some one while i pry it open here said the 
landlady quickly putting down the vinegar cruet so as to have one hand free here 
are you talking about prying open any of my doors with that she seized my 
arm the matter with you the matter with you shipmate in as calm but rapid 
a manner as possible i gave her to understand the whole case unconsciously clapping the 
vinegar cruet to one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then i 
seen it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing 
of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that harpoon was missing killed 
himself she cried stiggs done over goes another pity his poor mother will be the 
ruin of my house has the poor lad a sister that girl betty go to 
snarles the painter and tell him to paint me a sign suicides permitted here and 
no smoking in the parlor as well kill both birds at once kill the lord 
be merciful to his ghost that noise there you young man avast there and running 
up after me she caught me as i was again trying to force open the 
door allow it i have my premises spoiled go for the locksmith one about a 
mile from here but avast putting her hand in her side pocket a key fit 
i guess see and with that she turned it in the lock but alas supplemental 
bolt remained unwithdrawn within to burst it open said i and was running down the 
entry a little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing 
i should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with a 
sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark with a prodigious noise the door 
flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling 
and there good heavens there sat queequeg altogether cool and self collected right in the 
middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on top of his 
head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved 
image with scarce a sign of active life said i going up to him the 
matter with you been a so all day has he said the landlady but all 
we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like 
pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost intolerable it 
seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially as in all probability he had been sitting 
so for upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals hussey 
said i alive at all events so leave us if you please and i will 
see to this strange affair myself closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to 
prevail upon queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all 
he could all my polite arts and would not move a peg nor say a 
single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way 
i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do 
they fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be so 
yes part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest get up sooner 
or later no doubt it last for ever thank god and his ramadan only comes 
once a year and i believe very punctual then i went down to supper after 
sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just 
come from a plum pudding voyage as they called it that is a short whaling 
voyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the 
atlantic ocean only after listening to these plum puddingers till nearly eleven i went up 
stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have 
brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he was just where i had 
left him he had not stirred an inch i began to grow vexed with him 
it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half 
the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on 
his head sake queequeg get up and shake yourself get up and have some supper 
starve kill yourself queequeg but not a word did he reply despairing of him therefore 
i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great 
while he would follow me but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin 
jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night 
and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on for some time do all 
i would i could not get into the faintest doze i had blown out the 
candle and the mere thought of four feet there in that uneasy position stark alone 
in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of it sleeping all 
night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this 
dreary unaccountable ramadan but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till 
break of day when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if he had 
been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of sun 
entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but with a cheerful 
look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said 
his ramadan was over now as i before hinted i have no objection to any 
religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or 
insult any other person because that other person believe it also but when a religion 
becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine makes 
this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then i think it high 
time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him and just so 
i now did with queequeg said i into bed now and lie and listen to 
me i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions 
and coming down to the various religions of the present time during which time i 
labored to show queequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged ham squattings in cold 
cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in 
short to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense i told him too that 
he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me 
very badly pained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan 
of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves 
in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half starved this is 
the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters in one 
word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested 
apple dumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans i then 
asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly 
so that he could take it in he said no only upon one memorable occasion 
it was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining 
of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two 
in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening more queequeg said i 
shuddering will do for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them i had 
seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told me that it 
was the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the 
slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they 
were placed in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and 
cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths were sent round with the compliments to 
all his friends just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys after all 
i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg because 
in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless 
considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not 
more than one third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and finally 
he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than 
i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as 
though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be 
so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety at last we rose and dressed and queequeg 
taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should 
not make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the 
pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones chapter 18 his mark as 
we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carrying his 
harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he 
had not suspected my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no 
cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers do you mean by 
that captain peleg said i now jumping on the bulwarks and leaving my comrade standing 
on the wharf mean he replied must show his papers said captain bildad in his 
hollow voice sticking his head from behind out of the wigwam must show that converted 
son of darkness he added turning to queequeg thou at present in communion with any 
christian church said i a member of the first congregational church here be it said 
that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at last come to be converted into 
the churches congregational church cried bildad that worships in deacon deuteronomy meeting house and so 
saying taking out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and 
putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the 
bulwarks took a good long look at queequeg long hath he been a member he 
then said turning to me very long i rather guess young man said peleg he 
been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that blue off his 
face tell now cried bildad this philistine a regular member of deacon meeting i never 
saw him going there and i pass it every day know anything about deacon deuteronomy 
or his meeting said i i know is that queequeg here is a born member 
of the first congregational church he is a deacon himself queequeg is man said bildad 
sternly art skylarking with thyself thou young hittite what church dost thee mean answer me 
finding myself thus hard pushed i replied mean sir the same ancient catholic church to 
which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of us 
and every son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of 
this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some 
queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in that we all join hands thou 
splice hands cried peleg drawing nearer man better ship for a missionary instead of a 
fore mast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon father mapple himself beat it 
and reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers i say tell 
quohog that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what 
a harpoon got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right 
i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head 
of a whale boat did you ever strike a fish without saying a word queequeg 
in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows 
of one of the whale boats hanging to the side and then bracing his left 
knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this you see 
him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale 
eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over 
old broad brim clean across the decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of 
sight said queequeg quietly hauling in the line ee him whale e eye why dad 
whale dead bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the 
flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway i say you bildad and get the 
papers we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look 
ye quohog give ye the ninetieth lay and more than ever was given a harpooneer 
yet out of nantucket so down we went into the cabin and to my great 
joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same company to which i myself belonged when 
all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to 
me and said guess quohog there know how to write does he i say quohog 
blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark but at this question 
queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies looked no ways 
abashed but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an 
exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so that 
through captain obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this quohog his x 
mark meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly 
and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad skirted drab coat took out a 
bundle of tracts and selecting one entitled latter day coming or no time to lose 
placed it in hands and then grasping them and the book with both his looked 
earnestly into his eyes and said of darkness i must do my duty by thee 
i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all 
its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear i 
beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the 
hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness 
gracious steer clear of the fiery pit something of the salt sea yet lingered in 
old language heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases there avast there bildad avast now 
spoiling our harpooneer cried peleg harpooneers never make good takes the shark out of no 
harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish there was young nat swaine once 
the bravest boat header out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting 
and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he 
shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of after claps in case he got 
stove and went to davy jones peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thyself 
as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is 
to have the fear of death how then thou prate in this ungodly guise thou 
beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequod here had her three 
masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with 
captain ahab thou not think of death and the judgment then him hear him now 
cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets 
him all of ye think of that when every moment we thought the ship would 
sink death and the judgment then what with all three masts making such an everlasting 
thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us fore and aft think of 
death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then life was 
what captain ahab and i was thinking of and how to save all to rig 
jury to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of bildad 
said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him 
there he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top sail in 
the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an 
end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted chapter 19 the prophet have 
ye shipped in that ship queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were 
sauntering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when 
the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us levelled 
his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was but shabbily apparelled in faded 
jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck a confluent 
small pox had in all directions flowed over his face and left it like the 
complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up ye 
shipped in her he repeated mean the ship pequod i suppose said i trying to 
gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him the ship there he 
said drawing back his whole arm and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him 
with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object said i 
have just signed the articles down there about your souls what perhaps you got any 
he said quickly matter though i know many chaps that got any luck to and 
they are all the better off for it a a sort of a fifth wheel 
to a wagon are you jabbering about shipmate said i got enough though to make 
up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps abruptly said the stranger placing 
a nervous emphasis upon the word he said i go this fellow has broken loose 
from somewhere talking about something and somebody we know cried the stranger said seen old 
thunder yet have ye old thunder said i again riveted with the insane earnestness of 
his manner ahab the captain of our ship the pequod among some of us old 
sailor chaps he goes by that name ye seen him yet have ye we sick 
they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long right 
again before long laughed the stranger with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh ye when 
captain ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right 
not before do you know about him did they tell you about him say that 
tell much of anything about him only heard that a good whale hunter and a 
good captain to his crew true both true enough but you must jump when he 
gives an order step and growl growl and the word with captain ahab but nothing 
about that thing that happened to him off cape horn long ago when he lay 
like dead for three days and nights nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard 
afore the altar in santa nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash he 
spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy 
ye hear a word about them matters and something more eh no i think ye 
did how could ye who knows it not all nantucket i guess but mayhap heard 
tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that 
i dare say oh yes that every one knows mean they know only one leg 
and that a parmacetti took the other off friend said i all this gibberish of 
yours is about i know and i much care for it seems to me that 
you must be a little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of 
captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i 
know all about the loss of his leg all about it you do sure with 
finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggar like stranger stood a moment 
as if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and said shipped have 
ye names down on the papers well well signed is signed and to be will 
be and then again perhaps it be after all anyhow all fixed and arranged and 
some sailors or other must go with him i suppose as well these as any 
other men god pity morning to ye shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye sorry 
i stopped ye here friend said i you have anything important to tell us out 
with it but if you are only trying to bamboozle us you are mistaken in 
your game all i have to say said very well and i like to hear 
a chap talk up that way you are just the man for likes of ye 
morning to ye shipmates morning oh when ye get there tell concluded not to make 
one of my dear fellow you fool us that fool us it is the easiest 
thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great 
secret in him to ye shipmates morning it is said i along queequeg leave this 
crazy man but stop tell me your name will you elijah thought i and we 
walked away both commenting after each fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that 
he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not 
gone perhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and looking back 
as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us though at a 
distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg 
of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the 
stranger would turn the same corner that we did he did and then it seemed 
to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for 
the life of me imagine this circumstance coupled with his ambiguous half hinting half revealing 
shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half 
apprehensions and all connected with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg he had 
lost and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had 
said of him when i left the ship the day previous and the prediction of 
the squaw tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred 
other shadowy things i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really 
dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg and on 
that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on without seeming to notice 
us this relieved me and once more and finally as it seemed to me i 
pronounced him in my heart a humbug chapter 20 all astir a day or two 
passed and there was great activity aboard the pequod not only were the old sails 
being mended but new sails were coming on board and bolts of canvas and coils 
of rigging in short everything betokened that the preparations were hurrying to a close captain 
peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look 
out upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores and 
the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after 
night fall on the day following signing the articles word was given at all the 
inns where the company were stopping that their chests must be on board before night 
for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and 
i got down our traps resolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it 
seems they always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not 
sail for several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done 
and there is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequod 
was fully equipped every one knows what a multitude of sauce pans knives and forks 
shovels and tongs napkins nut crackers and what not are indispensable to the business of 
housekeeping just so with whaling which necessitates a three housekeeping upon the wide ocean far 
from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers and though this also holds true of 
merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen for 
besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution 
of the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented 
it must be remembered that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposed to 
accidents of all kinds and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things 
upon which the success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boats spare spars 
and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare captain and duplicate 
ship at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the 
pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoops and 
staves but as before hinted for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying 
on board of divers odds and ends of things both large and small chief among 
those who did this fetching and carrying was captain sister a lean old lady of 
a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if 
she could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once fairly 
getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar of 
pickles for the pantry another time with a bunch of quills for the chief desk 
where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the 
small of some rheumatic back never did any woman better deserve her name which was 
charity as everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt 
charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything 
that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in 
which her beloved brother bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score 
or two of well saved dollars but it was startling to see this excellent hearted 
quakeress coming on board as she did the last day with a long oil ladle 
in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad 
himself nor captain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with him 
a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his 
mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a while peleg came hobbling 
out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchways roaring up to 
the riggers at the mast head and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam 
during these days of preparation queequeg and i often visited the craft and as often 
i asked about captain ahab and how he was and when he was going to 
come on board his ship to these questions they would answer that he was getting 
better and better and was expected aboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and 
bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i 
had been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart 
that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage 
without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator 
of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea but when 
a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in 
the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself and much 
this way it was with me i said nothing and tried to think nothing at 
last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail 
so next morning queequeg and i took a very early start chapter 21 going aboard 
it was nearly six but only grey imperfect misty dawn when we drew nigh the 
wharf are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to queequeg 
be shadows off by sunrise i guess come on cried a voice whose owner at 
the same time coming close behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and 
then insinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely 
peering from queequeg to me it was elijah aboard off will you said i here 
said queequeg shaking himself going aboard then we are said i what business is that 
of yours do you know mr elijah that i consider you a little impertinent no 
no i aware of that said elijah slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg 
with the most unaccountable glances said i will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing 
we are going to the indian and pacific oceans and would prefer not to be 
detained be be ye coming back afore breakfast cracked queequeg said i on cried stationary 
elijah hailing us when we had removed a few paces mind him said i come 
on but he stole up to us again and suddenly clapping his hand on my 
shoulder ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship a while ago struck 
by this plain matter of fact question i answered saying i thought i did see 
four or five men but it was too dim to be sure dim very dim 
said elijah to ye once more we quitted him but once more he came softly 
after us and touching my shoulder again said if you can find now will ye 
who to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off i was going to 
warn ye never mind never all one all in the family too frost this morning 
it good bye to ye see ye again very soon i guess unless before the 
grand jury and with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for the moment 
in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence at last stepping on board the pequod 
we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked 
within the hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward to 
the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a light we went 
down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered pea jacket he 
was thrown at whole length upon two chests his face downwards and inclosed in his 
folded arms the profoundest slumber slept upon him sailors we saw queequeg where can they 
have gone to said i looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when 
on the wharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence 
i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it 
not for otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the thing down and again marking the 
sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body 
telling him to establish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the rear as though 
feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there 
queequeg sit there said i perry dood seat said queequeg country way hurt him face 
said i that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes heaving 
himself get off queequeg you are heavy grinding the face of the poor get off 
queequeg look twitch you off soon i wonder he wake queequeg removed himself to just 
beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the 
feet we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile 
upon questioning him in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his 
land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king chiefs 
and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders 
for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to 
buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers and 
alcoves besides it was very convenient on an excursion much better than those garden chairs 
which are convertible into walking sticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring 
him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp 
marshy place while narrating these things every time queequeg received the tomahawk from me he 
flourished the hatchet side of it over the head that for queequeg easy kill e 
oh perry easy he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk pipe 
which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his 
soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the strong vapor now completely 
filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him he breathed with a sort 
of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then 
sat up and rubbed his eyes he breathed at last be ye smokers men answered 
i does she sail aye ye are going in her be ye she sails to 
day the captain came aboard last night captain but him indeed i was going to 
ask him some further questions concerning ahab when we heard a noise on deck astir 
said the rigger a lively chief mate that good man and a pious but all 
alive now i must turn to and so saying he went on deck and we 
followed it was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and 
threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively engaged and several of the shore 
people were busy in bringing various last things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly 
enshrined within his cabin chapter 22 merry christmas at length towards noon upon the final 
dismissal of the riggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf 
and after the ever thoughtful charity had come off in a whale boat with her 
last night cap for stubb the second mate her brother in law and a spare 
bible for the all this the two captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin 
and turning to the chief mate peleg said mr starbuck are you sure everything is 
right captain ahab is all spoke to more to be got from shore eh well 
call all hands then muster aft need of profane words however great the hurry peleg 
said bildad away with thee friend starbuck and do our bidding how now here upon 
the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going 
it with a high hand on the quarter deck just as if they were to 
be joint commanders at sea as well as to all appearances in port and as 
for captain ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said 
he was in the cabin but then the idea was that his presence was by 
no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to 
sea indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the and as 
he was not yet completely they captain ahab stayed below and all this seemed natural 
enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for 
a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having 
a farewell merry making with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good 
with the pilot but there was not much chance to think over the matter for 
captain peleg was now all alive he seemed to do most of the talking and 
commanding and not bildad here ye sons of bachelors he cried as the sailors lingered 
at the main mast starbuck drive aft the tent there the next order as i 
hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the 
pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be 
the next thing to heaving up the anchor the capstan blood and thunder the next 
command and the crew sprang for the handspikes now in getting under weigh the station 
generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad 
who with peleg be it known in addition to his other officers was one of 
the licensed pilots of the being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in 
order to save the nantucket pilot fee to all the ships he was concerned in 
for he never piloted any other i say might now be seen actively engaged in 
looking over the bows for the approaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a 
dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some 
sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good will nevertheless 
not three days previous bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed 
on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed 
a small choice copy of watts in each berth meantime overseeing the other part of 
the ship captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost 
thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i 
paused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the perils 
we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot 
i was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious bildad might be found 
some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventy seventh lay when i felt a 
sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparition of 
captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was 
my first kick that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared thou 
sheep head spring and break thy backbone why ye spring i say all of quohog 
spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there scotch cap spring thou green pants 
spring i say all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he 
moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad 
kept leading off with his psalmody thinks i captain peleg must have been drinking something 
to day at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we 
glided it was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into 
night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us 
in ice as in polished armor the long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened 
in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving 
icicles depended from the bows lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever 
and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the 
shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady 
notes were heard fields beyond the swelling flood stand dressed in living green so to 
the jews old canaan stood while jordan rolled between never did those sweet words sound 
more sweetly to me than then they were full of hope and fruition spite of 
this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter 
jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store 
and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring 
untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer at last we gained such an offing that the two 
pilots were needed no longer the stout sail boat that had accompanied us began ranging 
alongside it was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected at this 
juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good 
a ship bound on so long and perilous a both stormy capes a ship in 
which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an 
old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting 
to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say good bye to 
a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him old bildad lingered long 
paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell 
word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and 
endless waters only bounded by the far off unseen eastern continents looked towards the land 
looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling 
a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up 
a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to 
say friend peleg i can stand it yes i can as for peleg himself he 
took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there was a tear 
twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near and he too did not 
a little run from cabin to a word below and now a word with starbuck 
the chief mate but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort 
of look about him old shipmate we must go back the main yard there boat 
ahoy stand by to come close alongside now careful careful bildad your last luck to 
ye to ye mr to ye mr bye and good luck to ye this day 
three years have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away 
bless ye and have ye in his holy keeping men murmured old bildad almost incoherently 
hope have fine weather now so that captain ahab may soon be moving among pleasant 
sun is all he needs and have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye 
go be careful in the hunt ye mates stave the boats needlessly ye harpooneers good 
white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year forget your prayers 
either mr starbuck mind that cooper waste the spare staves oh the sail needles are 
in the green locker whale it too much days men but miss a fair chance 
either rejecting good gifts have an eye to the molasses tierce mr stubb it was 
a little leaky i thought if ye touch at the islands mr flask beware of 
fornication good bye good bye keep that cheese too long down in the hold mr 
starbuck spoil be careful with the cents the pound it was and mind ye come 
captain bildad stop palavering and with that peleg hurried him over the side and both 
dropt into the boat ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between 
a screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave three heavy hearted 
cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic chapter 23 the lee shore 
some chapters back one bulkington was spoken of a tall newlanded mariner encountered in new 
bedford at the inn when on that shivering night the pequod thrust her vindictive bows 
into the cold malicious waves who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington 
i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in mid winter just 
landed from a four dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another 
tempestuous term the land seemed scorching to his feet wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable 
deep memories yield no epitaphs this six inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington 
let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm tossed ship 
that miserably drives along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port 
is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blankets friends all kind 
to our mortalities but in that gale the port the land is that direst jeopardy 
she must fly all hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel 
would make her shudder through and through with all her might she crowds all sail 
off shore in so doing fights the very winds that fain would blow her homeward 
seeks all the lashed landlessness again for sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend 
her bitterest foe know ye now bulkington glimpses do ye seem to see of that 
mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the 
soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven 
and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore but as in landlessness 
alone resides highest truth shoreless indefinite as better is it to perish in that howling 
infinite than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety for worm 
like then oh who would craven crawl to land terrors of the terrible is all 
this agony so vain take heart take heart o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up 
from the spray of thy ocean up leaps thy apotheosis chapter 24 the advocate as 
queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this 
business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical 
and disreputable pursuit therefore i am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the 
injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales in the first place it may be 
deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of 
whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions if 
a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the 
general opinion of his merits were he presented to the company as a harpooneer say 
and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials s w 
f sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed pre 
eminently presuming and ridiculous doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen 
is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of 
business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements 
butchers we are that is true but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge 
have been all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor and as for 
the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into 
certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the 
sperm whale ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but even 
granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of a whale 
ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle fields from which so many 
soldiers return to drink in all plaudits and if the idea of peril so much 
enhances the popular conceit of the profession let me assure ye that many a veteran 
who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of 
the sperm vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head for what are 
the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god but 
though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it unwittingly pay us the 
profoundest homage yea an all abounding adoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles 
that burn round the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory but 
look at this matter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see 
what we whalemen are and have been why did the dutch in de time have 
admirals of their whaling fleets why did louis xvi of france at his own personal 
expense fit out whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score 
or two of families from our own island of nantucket why did britain between the 
years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of 000 000 and 
lastly how comes it that we whalemen of america now outnumber all the rest of 
the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels 
manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming 4 000 000 of dollars the ships worth 
at the time of sailing 20 000 000 and every year importing into our harbors 
a well reaped harvest of 7 000 000 how comes all this if there be 
not something puissant in whaling but this is not the half look again i freely 
assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence 
which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world 
taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way and 
another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their 
sequential issues that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring 
themselves pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all 
these things let a handful suffice for many years past the whale ship has been 
the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth she 
has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had 
ever sailed if american and european men of war now peacefully ride in once savage 
harbors let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale ship which 
originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savages they may 
celebrate as they will the heroes of exploring expeditions your cooks your krusensterns but i 
say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket that were as great 
and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their succourless empty handedness they 
in the heathenish sharked waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with 
virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly 
have dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea 
voyages those things were but the life time commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers often adventures 
which vancouver dedicates three chapters to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in 
the common log ah the world oh the world until the whale fishery rounded cape 
horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europe 
and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast it was 
the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown touching those 
colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at 
last eventuated the liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain 
and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts that great america on the 
other side of the sphere australia was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman 
after its first blunder born discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunned those 
shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whale ship touched there the whale ship is the 
true mother of that now mighty colony moreover in the infancy of the first australian 
settlement the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the 
whale ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters the uncounted isles of all polynesia 
confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whale ship that cleared the 
way for the missionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries 
to their first destinations if that double bolted land japan is ever to become hospitable 
it is the whale ship alone to whom the credit will be due for already 
she is on the threshold but if in the face of all this you still 
declare that whaling has no æsthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready 
to shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every 
time the whale has no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler you will say 
the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler who wrote the first account 
of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed the first narrative of a 
whaling voyage who but no less a prince than alfred the great who with his 
own royal pen took down the words from other the norwegian whale hunter of those 
times and who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke true enough 
but then whalemen themselves are poor devils they have no good blood in their veins 
no good blood in their veins they have something better than royal blood there the 
grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the 
old settlers of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and kith 
and kin to noble day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world 
to the other good again but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable 
whaling not respectable whaling is imperial by old english statutory law the whale is declared 
royal fish oh only nominal the whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing 
way the whale never figured in any grand imposing way in one of the mighty 
triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the capital the bones of a 
whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in 
the cymballed procession see subsequent chapters for something more on this head grant it since 
you cite it but say what you will there is no real dignity in whaling 
no dignity in whaling the dignity of our calling the very heavens attest cetus is 
a constellation in the south no more drive down your hat in presence of the 
czar and take it off to queequeg no more i know a man that in 
his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty whales i account that man more honorable 
than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns and 
as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing 
in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high 
hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do 
anything that upon the whole a man might rather have done than to have left 
undone if at my death my executors or more properly my creditors find any precious 
mss in my desk then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory 
to whaling for a whale ship was my yale college and my harvard chapter 25 
postscript in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but substantiated 
facts but after embattling his facts an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable 
surmise which might tell eloquently upon his an advocate would he not be blameworthy it 
is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern ones a 
certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through there is a 
saltcellar of state so called and there may be a castor of state how they 
use the salt knows certain i am however that a head is solemnly oiled at 
his coronation even as a head of salad can it be though that they anoint 
it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint machinery much 
might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common 
life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably 
smells of that anointing in truth a mature man who uses hair oil unless medicinally 
that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere as a general rule 
he amount to much in his totality but the only thing to be considered here 
is kind of oil is used at coronations certainly it cannot be olive oil nor 
macassar oil nor castor oil nor oil nor train oil nor cod liver oil what 
then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweetest 
of all oils think of that ye loyal britons we whalemen supply your kings and 
queens with coronation stuff chapter 26 knights and squires the chief mate of the pequod 
was starbuck a native of nantucket and a quaker by descent he was a long 
earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot 
latitudes his flesh being hard as twice baked biscuit transported to the indies his live 
blood would not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time 
of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his 
state is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen those summers had dried 
up all his physical superfluousness but this his thinness so to speak seemed no more 
the token of wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily 
blight it was merely the condensation of the man he was by no means ill 
looking quite the contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped 
up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian this 
starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come and to endure always as 
now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior 
vitality was warranted to do well in all climates looking into his eyes you seemed 
to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand fold perils he had calmly 
confronted through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a 
telling pantomime of action and not a tame chapter of sounds yet for all his 
hardy sobriety and fortitude there were certain qualities in him which at times affected and 
in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a 
seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life 
did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in 
some organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portents and 
inward presentiments were his and if at times these things bent the welded iron of 
his soul much more did his far away domestic memories of his young cape wife 
and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature 
and open him still further to those latent influences which in some honest hearted men 
restrain the gush of dare devil daring so often evinced by others in the more 
perilous vicissitudes of the fishery will have no man in my boat said starbuck is 
not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean not only that the 
most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the 
encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than 
a coward aye said stubb the second mate there is as careful a man as 
find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long see what that word precisely 
means when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter starbuck 
was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a sentiment but a thing 
simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions besides he 
thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage was one of the great staple 
outfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly 
wasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun down nor for 
persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him for thought starbuck 
i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not 
to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so 
killed starbuck well knew what doom was his own where in the bottomless deeps could 
he find the torn limbs of his brother with memories like these in him and 
moreover given to a certain superstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck 
which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but it was not in 
reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as 
he had it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering 
an element in him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its confinement and 
burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it was that sort 
of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm in the 
conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of 
the world yet cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace 
you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man but were the coming 
narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor fortitude scarce might i 
have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking 
to expose the fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable as joint 
stock companies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be men may have mean 
and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such 
a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows 
should run to throw their costliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so 
far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds 
with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor ruined man nor can piety 
itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars but 
this august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but 
that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture thou shalt see it shining in the 
arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on all 
hands radiates without end from god himself the great god absolute the centre and circumference 
of all democracy his omnipresence our divine equality if then to meanest mariners and renegades 
and castaways i shall hereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round them tragic graces 
if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among them all shall at times 
lift himself to the exalted mounts if i shall touch that arm with some ethereal 
light if i shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun then against 
all mortal critics bear me out in it thou just spirit of equality which hast 
spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind bear me out in it 
thou great democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the pale 
poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold the stumped 
and paupered arm of old cervantes thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the 
pebbles who didst hurl him upon a war horse who didst thunder him higher than 
a throne thou who in all thy mighty earthly marchings ever cullest thy selectest champions 
from the kingly commons bear me out in it o god chapter 27 knights and 
squires stubb was the second mate he was a native of cape cod and hence 
according to local usage was called a cape cod man a happy go lucky neither 
craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indifferent air and while engaged 
in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a 
journeyman joiner engaged for the year good humored easy and careless he presided over his 
whale boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew 
all invited guests he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of 
the boat as an old stage driver is about the snugness of his box when 
close to the whale in the very death lock of the fight he handled his 
unpitying lance coolly and off handedly as a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum 
over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long 
usage had for this stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair what 
he thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of it 
at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his 
mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took 
it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir 
themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and 
not sooner what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easy going unfearing man 
so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave 
pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that 
almost impious good humor of his that thing must have been his pipe for like 
his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his 
face you would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk 
without his nose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipes there 
ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he 
turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to 
the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew for 
when stubb dressed instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers he put his 
pipe into his mouth i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at 
least of his peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore 
or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have 
died exhaling it and as in time of the cholera some people go about with 
a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations tobacco smoke might 
have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent the third mate was flask a native 
of tisbury in vineyard a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who 
somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him and 
therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him to destroy them whenever 
encountered so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels 
of their majestic bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension 
of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale 
was but a species of magnified mouse or at least water rat requiring only a 
little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and 
boil this ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter 
of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three voyage 
round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time as 
a nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly 
divided little flask was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last 
long they called him king post on board of the pequod because in form he 
could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in arctic 
whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it serves 
to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas now these three 
stubb and flask were momentous men they it was who by universal prescription commanded three 
of the boats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab 
would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three headsmen were as 
captains of companies or being armed with their long keen whaling spears they were as 
a picked trio of lancers even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins and since 
in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic knight of old is 
always accompanied by his boat steerer or harpooneer who in certain conjunctures provides him with 
a fresh lance when the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the 
assault and moreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness 
it is therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the harpooneers 
were and to what headsman each of them belonged first of all was queequeg whom 
starbuck the chief mate had selected for his squire but queequeg is already known next 
was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of vineyard where 
there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which has long 
supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers in the 
fishery they usually go by the generic name of gay headers long lean sable hair 
his high cheek bones and black rounding an indian oriental in their largeness but antarctic 
in their glittering this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those 
proud warrior hunters who in quest of the great new england moose had scoured bow 
in hand the aboriginal forests of the main but no longer snuffing in the trail 
of the wild beasts of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the 
great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible 
arrow of the sires to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs 
you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans and half 
believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of 
the air tashtego was stubb the second squire third among the harpooneers was daggoo a 
gigantic coal black negro savage with a lion like ahasuerus to behold suspended from his 
ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called them ring bolts and 
would talk of securing the top sail halyards to them in his youth daggoo had 
voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native 
coast and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the 
pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many years the bold 
life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of 
men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and erect as a giraffe moved 
about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks there 
was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before 
him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress curious to tell 
this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo was the squire of little flask who looked like a 
chess man beside him as for the residue of the company be it said that 
at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the 
mast employed in the american whale fishery are americans born though pretty nearly all the 
officers are herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with the 
american army and military and merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the construction 
of the american canals and railroads the same i say because in all these cases 
the native american liberally provides the brains the rest of the world as generously supplying 
the muscles no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the 
outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of 
those rocky shores in like manner the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or london 
put in at the shetland islands to receive the full complement of their crew upon 
the passage homewards they drop them there again how it is there is no telling 
but islanders seem to make the best whalemen they were nearly all islanders in the 
pequod isolatoes too i call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each 
isolato living on a separate continent of his own yet now federated along one keel 
what a set these isolatoes were an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of 
the sea and all the ends of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod 
to lay the grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever 
come back black little never no he went before poor alabama boy on the grim 
forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time 
when sent for to the great quarter deck on high he was bid strike in 
with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero 
there chapter 28 ahab for several days after leaving nantucket nothing above hatches was seen 
of captain ahab the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches and for aught 
that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commanders of 
the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory 
that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and 
dictator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the 
now sacred retreat of the cabin every time i ascended to the deck from my 
watches below i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for 
my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea 
became almost a perturbation this was strangely heightened at times by the ragged diabolical incoherences 
uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of 
but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moods i was almost ready 
to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves but whatever 
it was of apprehensiveness or call it i felt yet whenever i came to look 
about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions for 
though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric 
heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchant ship companies which my previous 
experiences had made me acquainted with still i ascribed rightly ascribed the fierce uniqueness of 
the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked 
but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship the 
mates which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings and induce confidence and 
cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three better more likely sea officers and men 
each in his own different way could not readily be found and they were every 
one of them americans a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being christmas 
when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting polar 
weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every 
degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all 
its intolerable weather behind us it was one of those less lowering but still grey 
and gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the ship was 
rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as 
i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as 
i levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shivers ran over me reality outran apprehension 
captain ahab stood upon his quarter deck there seemed no sign of common bodily illness 
about him nor of the recovery from any he looked like a man cut away 
from the stake when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them 
or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness his whole high broad form 
seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like cast perseus threading 
its way out from among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of 
his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a 
slender rod like mark lividly whitish it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the 
straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it 
and without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to 
bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded 
whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by 
some desperate wound no one could certainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage 
little or no allusion was made to it especially by the mates but once senior 
an old gay head indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was 
full forty years old did ahab become that way branded and then it came upon 
him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at 
sea yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated an 
old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of nantucket had never ere this 
laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the old sea traditions the immemorial credulities popularly invested 
this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment so that no white sailor seriously contradicted 
him when he said that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly laid might hardly 
come to pass so he whoever should do that last office for the dead would 
find a birth mark on him from crown to sole so powerfully did the whole 
grim aspect of ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for 
the first few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness 
was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously 
come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished 
bone of the sperm jaw he was dismasted off japan said the old gay head 
indian once like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it 
he has a quiver of i was struck with the singular posture he maintained upon 
each side of the quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds there was 
an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank his bone 
leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud captain ahab 
stood erect looking straight out beyond the ever pitching prow there was an infinity of 
firmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that 
glance not a word he spoke nor did his officers say aught to him though 
by all their minutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful 
consciousness of being under a troubled master eye and not only that but moody stricken 
ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal 
overbearing dignity of some mighty woe ere long from his first visit in the air 
he withdrew into his cabin but after that morning he was every day visible to 
the crew either standing in his pivot hole or seated upon an ivory stool he 
had or heavily walking the deck as the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to 
grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if when 
the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea 
had then kept him so secluded and by and by it came to pass that 
he was almost continually in the air but as yet for all that he said 
or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as 
another mast but the pequod was only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly 
all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to so that there was 
little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase 
away for that one interval the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his 
brow as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon nevertheless ere 
long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually 
to charm him from his mood for as when the red cheeked dancing girls april 
and may trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest most thunder 
cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such 
glad hearted visitants so ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful 
allurings of that girlish air more than once did he put forth the faint blossom 
of a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in a 
smile chapter 29 enter ahab to him stubb some days elapsed and ice and icebergs 
all astern the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea 
almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic the warmly 
cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant days were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet heaped 
up with rose water snow the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled 
velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earls the 
golden helmeted suns for sleeping man hard to choose between such winsome days and such 
seducing nights but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new 
spells and potencies to the outward world inward they turned upon the soul especially when 
the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the 
clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights and all these subtle agencies more and more 
they wrought on texture old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with 
life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death among sea 
commanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night cloaked deck 
it was so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to 
live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin 
than from the cabin to the planks feels like going down into tomb would mutter 
to an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to 
my grave dug berth so almost every twenty four hours when the watches of the 
night were set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below 
and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors flung 
it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt it to its 
place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when this sort of steady quietude would 
begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabin scuttle and ere long 
the old man would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way 
some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like these he usually 
abstained from patrolling the quarter deck because to his wearied mates seeking repose within six 
inches of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of 
that bony step that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks 
but once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with 
heavy lumber like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the 
old second mate came up from below with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that 
if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay 
but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly 
about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel ah 
stubb thou didst not know ahab then i a cannon ball stubb said ahab thou 
wouldst wad me that fashion but go thy ways i had forgot below to thy 
nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling 
one at last dog and kennel starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so 
suddenly scornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly am not used 
to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like it 
sir gritted ahab between his set teeth and violently moving away as if to avoid 
some passionate temptation sir not yet said stubb emboldened will not tamely be called a 
dog sir be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and 
begone or clear the world of thee as he said this ahab advanced upon him 
with such overbearing terrors in his aspect that stubb involuntarily retreated was never served so 
before without giving a hard blow for it muttered stubb as he found himself descending 
the cabin scuttle very queer stop stubb somehow now i well know whether to go 
back and strike him that here on my knees and pray for him yes that 
was the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i 
ever did pray queer very queer and queer too aye take him fore and aft 
about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with how he flashed at me eyes 
like powder pans is he mad anyway something on his mind as sure as there 
must be something on a deck when it cracks he aint in his bed now 
either more than three hours out of the twenty four and he sleep then that 
dough boy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old 
hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the 
coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though 
a baked brick had been on it a hot old man i guess got what 
some folks ashore call a conscience a kind of tic dolly row they nor a 
toothache well well i know what it is but the lord keep me from catching 
it full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the after hold for every 
night as dough boy tells me he suspects that for i should like to know 
made appointments with him in the hold that queer now but no telling the old 
goes for a snooze damn me worth a while to be born into the world 
if only to fall right asleep and now that i think of it about the 
first thing babies do and a sort of queer too damn me but all things 
are queer come to think of but against my principles think not is my eleventh 
commandment and sleep when you can is my here goes again but that he call 
me a dog blazes he called me ten times a donkey and piled a lot 
of jackasses on top of that he might as well have kicked me and done 
with it maybe he did kick me and i observe it i was so taken 
all aback with his brow somehow it flashed like a bleached bone what the the 
matter with me i stand right on my legs coming afoul of that old man 
has a sort of turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have 
been dreaming how how the only to stash it so here goes to hammock again 
and in the morning see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight chapter 30 
the pipe when stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks 
and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the 
watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe lighting the 
pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the 
deck he sat and smoked in old norse times the thrones of the sea loving 
danish kings were fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale how could one 
look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without bethinking him of the 
royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea 
and a great lord of leviathans was ahab some moments passed during which the thick 
vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs which blew back again into 
his face now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube smoking no longer soothes oh 
my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone here have 
i been unconsciously toiling not and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward 
and with such nervous whiffs as if like the dying whale my final jets were 
the strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this pipe this thing 
that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs 
not among torn iron grey locks like mine smoke no he tossed the still lighted 
pipe into the sea the fire hissed in the waves the same instant the ship 
shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made with slouched hat ahab lurchingly paced the 
planks chapter 31 queen mab next morning stubb accosted flask a queer dream king post 
i never had you know the old ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me 
with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man 
i kicked my leg right off and then presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i 
like a blazing fool kept kicking at it but what was still more curious know 
how curious all dreams all this rage that i was in i somehow seemed to 
be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that 
kick from ahab thinks i the row not a real leg only a false leg 
and a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump what makes a 
blow from the hand flask fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from 
a cane the living makes the living insult my little man and thinks i to 
myself all the while mind while i was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed 
confoundedly contradictory was it all all the while i say i was thinking to myself 
his leg now but a whalebone cane yes thinks i was only a playful fact 
only a whaleboning that he gave a base kick besides thinks i at it once 
why the end of foot a small sort of end it is whereas if a 
broad footed farmer kicked me a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled down 
to a point only but now comes the greatest joke of the dream flask while 
i was battering away at the pyramid a sort of badger haired old merman with 
a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders and slews me round are 
you says he slid man but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next 
moment i was over the fright am i about says i at last what business 
is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do you want a 
kick by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round 
his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had 
for a do you think i saw thunder alive man his stern was stuck full 
of marlinspikes with the points out says i on second thoughts guess i kick you 
old fellow stubb said he stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort 
of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he going to stop 
saying over his stubb wise stubb i thought i might as well fall to kicking 
the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he 
roared out that kicking says i the matter now old fellow ye here says he 
argue the insult captain ahab kicked ye he he did says here it was good 
says used his ivory leg he he did says i then says he stubb what 
have you to complain of he kick with right good will it a common pitch 
pine leg he kicked with was it no you were kicked by a great man 
and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb an honor i consider it an honor listen 
wise stubb in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped 
by a queen and made garter knights of but be your boast stubb that ye 
were kicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say 
be kicked by him account his kicks honors and on no account kick back for 
you help yourself wise stubb you see that pyramid with that he all of a 
sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air i snored 
rolled over and there i was in my hammock now what do you think of 
that dream flask know it seems a sort of foolish to me tho be may 
be but made a wise man of me flask see ahab standing there sideways looking 
over the stern well the best thing you can do flask is to let the 
old man alone never speak to him whatever he says halloa that he shouts hark 
head there look sharp all of ye there are whales hereabouts ye see a white 
one split your lungs for him do you think of that now flask there a 
small drop of something queer about that eh a white ye mark that man look 
something special in the wind stand by for it flask ahab has that bloody on 
his mind but mum he comes this way chapter 32 cetology already we are boldly 
launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in its unshored harbourless immensities 
ere that come to pass ere the weedy hull rolls side by side with the 
barnacled hulls of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to 
a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations 
and allusions of all sorts which are to follow it is some systematized exhibition of 
the whale in his broad genera that i would now fain put before you yet 
is it no easy task the classification of the constituents of a chaos nothing less 
is here essayed listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down branch 
of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled cetology says captain scoresby 
a d 1820 is not my intention were it in my power to enter into 
the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families 
utter confusion exists among the historians of this sperm whale says surgeon beale a d 
1839 to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters veil covering our knowledge of the 
cetacea field strewn with thorns these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists thus 
speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those lights of 
zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of books there 
are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of 
whales many are the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who 
have at large or in little written of the whale run over a few authors 
of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linnæus rondeletius willoughby green 
artedi sibbald brisson marten lacépède bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier john hunter owen scoresby 
beale bennett j ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t 
cheever but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extracts 
will show of the names in this list of whale authors only those following owen 
ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and 
whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate subject of the greenland or right whale 
he is the best existing authority but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the 
great sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning and here 
be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the 
seas he is not even by any means the largest of the whales yet owing 
to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy 
years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm whale and which ignorance to 
this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale ports 
this usurpation has been every way complete reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in 
the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one 
rival was to them the monarch of the seas but the time has at last 
come for a new proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people all greenland 
whale is deposed great sperm whale now reigneth there are only two books in being 
which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the 
same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt those books are and both 
in their time surgeons to english south sea whale ships and both exact and reliable 
men the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is 
necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostly 
confined to scientific description as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not 
complete in any literature far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life 
now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only 
an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all its departments 
by subsequent laborers as no better man advances to take this matter in hand i 
hereupon offer my own poor endeavors i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed 
to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend 
to a minute anatomical description of the various species this place at much of any 
description my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology 
i am the architect not the builder but it is a ponderous task no ordinary 
letter sorter in the post office is equal to it to grope down into the 
bottom of the sea after them to have hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and 
very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i that i 
should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful tauntings in job might 
well appal me will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee behold the hope 
of him is vain but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans i 
have had to do with whales with these visible hands i am in earnest and 
i will try there are some preliminaries to settle first the uncertain unsettled condition of 
this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in 
some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in 
his system of nature a d 1776 linnæus declares hereby separate the whales from the 
fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year 1850 sharks 
and shad alewives and herring against express edict were still found dividing the possession of 
the same seas with the leviathan the grounds upon which linnæus would fain have banished 
the whales from the waters he states as follows account of their warm bilocular heart 
their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally 
lege naturæ jure meritoque i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley 
coffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united in 
the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient charley profanely hinted they were 
humbug be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned ground 
that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me this 
fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect does the whale differ 
from other fish above linnæus has given you those items but in brief they are 
these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded next 
how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicuously to label 
him for all time to come to be short then a whale is a spouting 
fish with a horizontal tail there you have him however contracted that definition is the 
result of expanded meditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is 
not a fish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is 
still more cogent as coupled with the first almost any one must have noticed that 
all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a vertical or up 
and down tail whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped 
invariably assumes a horizontal position by the above definition of what a whale is i 
do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with 
the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it 
any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed 
fish must be included in this ground plan of cetology now then come the grand 
divisions of the entire whale host i am aware that down to the present time 
the fish styled lamatins and dugongs pig fish and sow fish of the coffins of 
nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales but as these pig fish are 
a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet 
hay and especially as they do not spout i deny their credentials as whales and 
have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology first according to 
magnitude i divide the whales into three primary books subdivisible into chapters and these shall 
comprehend them all both small and large i the folio whale ii the octavo whale 
iii the duodecimo whale as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale 
of the octavo the grampus of the duodecimo the porpoise folios among these i here 
include the following chapters the sperm whale ii the right whale iii the fin back 
whale iv the hump backed whale v the razor back whale vi the sulphur bottom 
whale book i folio chapter i sperm whale whale among the english of old vaguely 
known as the trumpa whale and the physeter whale and the anvil headed whale is 
the present cachalot of the french and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus 
of the long words he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the 
most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by 
far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable 
substance spermaceti is obtained all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged upon 
it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically considered it 
is absurd some centuries ago when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his 
own proper individuality and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish 
in those days spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a 
creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale 
it was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the 
greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses in those times also 
spermaceti was exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment and 
medicament it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an 
ounce of rhubarb when as i opine in the course of time the true nature 
of spermaceti became known its original name was still retained by the dealers no doubt 
to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity and so 
the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which 
this spermaceti was really derived book i folio chapter ii right whale one respect this 
is the most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly hunted by man 
it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known 
as oil an inferior article in commerce among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by 
all the following titles the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale 
the true whale the right whale there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity 
of the species thus multitudinously baptised what then is the whale which i include in 
the second species of my folios it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists 
the greenland whale of the english whalemen the baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen the 
growlands walfish of the swedes it is the whale which for more than two centuries 
past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas it is 
the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean on the 
brazil banks on the west coast and various other parts of the world designated by 
them right whale cruising grounds some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale 
of the english and the right whale of the americans but they precisely agree in 
all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon 
which to ground a radical distinction it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most 
inconclusive differences that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate the right whale 
will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale 
book i folio chapter iii fin back this head i reckon a monster which by 
the various names of fin back tall spout and long john has been seen almost 
in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried 
by passengers crossing the atlantic in the new york packet tracks in the length he 
attains and in his baleen the fin back resembles the right whale but is of 
a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive his great lips present 
a cable like aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting folds of large wrinkles his grand 
distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object 
this fin is some three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinder part 
of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even 
if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will 
at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface when the sea is moderately calm 
and slightly marked with spherical ripples and this gnomon like fin stands up and casts 
shadows upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding 
it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hour lines graved on it 
on that ahaz dial the shadow often goes back the fin back is not gregarious 
he seems a whale hater as some men are man haters very shy always going 
solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters his straight 
and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted 
with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit from 
man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race bearing for his 
mark that style upon his back from having the baleen in his mouth the fin 
back is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales 
that is whales with baleen of these so called whalebone whales there would seem to 
be several varieties most of which however are little known broad nosed whales and beaked 
whales pike headed whales bunched whales under jawed whales and rostrated whales are the names 
for a few sorts in connection with this appellative of whales it is of great 
importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to 
some kind of whales yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of 
the leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that 
those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for 
a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions which the whale in 
his kinds presents how then the baleen hump back fin and teeth these are things 
whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what 
may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars thus the 
sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases 
then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these has baleen but 
there again the similitude ceases and it is just the same with the other parts 
above mentioned in various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the 
case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy 
all general methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one of the 
whale naturalists has split but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts 
of the whale in his at least we shall be able to hit the right 
classification nay what thing for example is there in the greenland anatomy more striking than 
his baleen yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to 
classify the greenland whale and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans 
why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer 
as those external ones already enumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of 
the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way and 
this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can 
possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceed book i folio chapter iv hump 
back whale is often seen on the northern american coast he has been frequently captured 
there and towed into harbor he has a great pack on him like a peddler 
or you might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular 
name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a 
hump though a smaller one his oil is not very valuable he has baleen he 
is the most gamesome and light hearted of all the whales making more gay foam 
and white water generally than any other of them book i folio chapter v razor 
back this whale little is known but his name i have seen him at a 
distance off cape horn of a retiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers though 
no coward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back which 
rises in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him 
nor does anybody else book i folio chapter vi sulphur bottom retiring gentleman with a 
brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tiles in some of his profounder 
divings he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the 
remoter southern seas and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance 
he is never chased he would run away with rope walks of line prodigies are 
told of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothing more that is true of 
ye nor can the oldest nantucketer thus ends book i folio and now begins book 
ii octavo octavoes embrace the whales of middling magnitude among which present may be numbered 
the grampus ii the black fish iii the narwhale iv the thrasher v the killer 
why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain because while 
the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain 
a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the quarto volume in its dimensioned form 
does not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume does book 
ii octavo chapter i grampus this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has 
furnished a proverb to landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet 
is he not popularly classed among whales but possessing all the grand distinctive features of 
the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one he is of moderate octavo size 
varying from fifteen to twenty five feet in length and of corresponding dimensions round the 
waist he swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable 
in quantity and pretty good for light by some fishermen his approach is regarded as 
premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale book ii octavo chapter ii black 
fish give the popular names for all these fish for generally they are the best 
where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so and suggest 
another i do so now touching the black fish so called because blackness is the 
rule among almost all whales so call him the hyena whale if you please his 
voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips 
are curved upwards he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale averages 
some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almost all latitudes he 
has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which looks something 
like a roman nose when not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture 
the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic some frugal 
housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead 
of odorous wax though their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield 
you upwards of thirty gallons of oil book ii octavo chapter iii narwhale that is 
nostril whale instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose from his peculiar 
horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the creature is some sixteen feet in 
length while its horn averages five feet though some exceed ten and even attain to 
fifteen feet strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the 
jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only found 
on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner something analogous to 
the aspect of a clumsy left handed man what precise purpose this ivory horn or 
lance answers it would be hard to say it does not seem to be used 
like the blade of the sword fish and bill fish though some sailors tell me 
that the narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the 
sea for food charley coffin said it was used for an ice piercer for the 
narwhale rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice 
thrusts his horn up and so breaks through but you cannot prove either of these 
surmises to be correct my own opinion is that however this one sided horn may 
really be used by the that may would certainly be very convenient to him for 
a folder in reading pamphlets the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the 
horned whale and the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism 
to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain cloistered old authors 
i have gathered that this same sea horn was in ancient days regarded as the 
great antidote against poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices it was 
also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns 
of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it was in itself accounted an 
object of great curiosity black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return 
from that voyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from 
a window of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down the thames sir martin 
returned from that voyage saith black letter bended knees he presented to her highness a 
prodigious long horn of the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the 
castle at windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knees 
did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the 
unicorn nature the narwhale has a very picturesque leopard like look being of a milk 
white ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black his oil is very 
superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted 
he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas book ii octavo chapter iv killer this 
whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed 
naturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say that 
he was about the bigness of a grampus he is very sort of feegee fish 
he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a 
leech till the mighty brute is worried to death the killer is never hunted i 
never heard what sort of oil he has exception might be taken to the name 
bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness for we are all killers 
on land and on sea bonapartes and sharks included book ii octavo chapter v thrasher 
gentleman is famous for his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his 
foes he mounts the folio back and as he swims he works his passage by 
flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process still 
less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both are outlaws even in 
the lawless seas thus ends book ii octavo and begins book iii duodecimo duodecimoes include 
the smaller whales i the huzza porpoise ii the algerine porpoise iii the mealy mouthed 
porpoise to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly 
seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among 
word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creatures 
set down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of 
what a whale i e a spouting fish with a horizontal tail book iii duodecimo 
chapter 1 huzza porpoise is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe the 
name is of my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises 
and something must be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always 
swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like 
caps in a fourth of july crowd their appearance is generally hailed with delight by 
the mariner full of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward 
they are the lads that always live before the wind they are accounted a lucky 
omen if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven 
help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye a well fed plump 
huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil but the fine and 
delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable it is in request among jewellers 
and watchmakers sailors put it on their hones porpoise meat is good eating you know 
it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts indeed his spout is 
so small that it is not very readily discernible but the next time you have 
a chance watch him and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in 
miniature book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoise pirate very savage he is only found 
i think in the pacific he is somewhat larger than the huzza porpoise but much 
of the same general make provoke him and he will buckle to a shark i 
have lowered for him many times but never yet saw him captured book iii duodecimo 
chapter iii mealy mouthed porpoise largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific 
so far as it is known the only english name by which he has hitherto 
been designated is that of the whale porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly 
found in the vicinity of that folio in shape he differs in some degree from 
the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of 
quite a neat and gentleman like figure he has no fins on his back most 
other porpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel 
hue but his mealy mouth spoils all though his entire back down to his side 
fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in 
a hull called the waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two 
separate colours black above and white below the white comprises part of his head and 
the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just escaped 
from a felonious visit to a meal bag a most mean and mealy aspect his 
oil is much like that of the common porpoise beyond the duodecimo this system does 
not proceed inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have 
all the leviathans of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive half fabulous 
whales which as an american whaleman i know by reputation but not personally i shall 
enumerate them by their fore castle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable 
to future investigators who may complete what i have here but begun if any of 
the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated 
into this system according to his folio octavo or duodecimo magnitude bottle nose whale the 
junk whale the pudding headed whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon whale 
the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the iceberg whale the quog whale 
the blue whale etc from icelandic dutch and old english authorities there might be quoted 
other lists of uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but i omit 
them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds full of 
leviathanism but signifying nothing finally it was stated at the outset that this system would 
not be here and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that i have 
kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished even as 
the great cathedral of cologne was left with the crane still standing upon the top 
of the uncompleted tower for small erections may be finished by their first architects grand 
ones true ones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever completing 
anything this whole book is but a but the draught of a draught oh time 
strength cash and patience chapter 33 the specksnyder concerning the officers of the whale craft 
this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity 
on ship board arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class 
unknown of course in any other marine than the whale fleet the large importance attached 
to the vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery 
two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged 
in the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an officer 
called the specksnyder literally this word means fat cutter usage however in time made it 
equivalent to chief harpooneer in those days the authority was restricted to the navigation and 
general management of the vessel while over the whale hunting department and all its concerns 
the specksnyder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted 
title of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is 
sadly abridged at present he ranks simply as senior harpooneer and as such is but 
one of the more inferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers 
the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he 
is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstances night watches 
on a whaling ground the command of the deck is also his therefore the grand 
political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men 
before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior though always 
by them familiarly regarded as their social equal now the grand distinction drawn between officer 
and man at sea is first lives aft the last forward hence in whale ships 
and merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and so too in 
most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the 
ship that is to say they take their meals in the cabin and sleep in 
a place indirectly communicating with it though the long period of a southern whaling voyage 
by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar 
perils of it and the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom 
high or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their common 
luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these things do 
in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet 
never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some primitive 
instances live together for all that the punctilious externals at least of the quarter deck 
are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket 
ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter deck with an elated 
grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as 
if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilot cloth and though 
of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that 
sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous 
obedience though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping 
upon the quarter deck and though there were times when owing to peculiar circumstances connected 
with events hereafter to be detailed he addressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension 
or in terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservant of 
the paramount forms and usages of the sea nor perhaps will it fail to be 
eventually perceived that behind those forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself 
incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately 
intended to subserve that certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in a good 
degree remained unmanifested through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship 
for be a intellectual superiority what it will it can never assume the practical available 
supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments 
always in themselves more or less paltry and base this it is that for ever 
keeps true princes of the empire from the hustings and leaves the highest honors that 
this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority 
to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over 
the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks in these small things when 
extreme political superstitions invest them that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they 
have imparted potency but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed 
crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch abased before 
the tremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its 
fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art 
as the one now alluded to but ahab my captain still moves before me in 
all his nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperors and kings i 
must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whale hunter 
like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me oh ahab 
what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies 
and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air chapter 34 the 
cabin table it is noon and dough boy the steward thrusting his pale loaf of 
bread face from the cabin scuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting 
in the lee quarter boat has just been taking an observation of the sun and 
is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallion shaped tablet reserved for that 
daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to 
the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but presently 
catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the deck and in an 
even unexhilarated voice saying mr starbuck disappears into the cabin when the last echo of 
his step has died away and starbuck the first emir has every reason to suppose 
that he is seated then starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along 
the planks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of 
pleasantness mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile 
and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right 
with that important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid 
mr flask follows after his predecessors but the third emir now seeing himself all alone 
on the quarter deck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all 
sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his shoes he 
strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand head 
and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a 
shelf he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the 
deck reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping 
into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent 
hilarious little flask enters king presence in the character of abjectus or the slave it 
is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea 
usages that while in the open air of the deck some officers will upon provocation 
bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those 
very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same cabin 
and straightway their inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he 
sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this 
difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have 
been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane 
grandeur but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own 
private dinner table of invited guests that unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for 
the time that royalty of state transcends for belshazzar was not the greatest who has 
but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be cæsar it is 
a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now if to this consideration 
you superadd the official supremacy of a ship master then by inference you will derive 
the cause of that peculiarity of sea life just mentioned over his ivory inlaid table 
ahab presided like a mute maned sea lion on the white coral beach surrounded by 
his warlike but still deferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waited to 
be served they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed 
not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind their intent eyes all fastened 
upon the old knife as he carved the chief dish before him i do not 
suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation 
even upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out his 
knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby motioned plate 
towards him the mate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly 
and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it 
noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where 
the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin meals were 
somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab forbade not 
conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief it was to choking stubb when 
a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and poor little flask he 
was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party his were the 
shinbones of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks for flask to have 
presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the 
first degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have 
been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say 
ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself the chances were ahab had never 
so much as noticed it least of all did flask presume to help himself to 
butter whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account 
of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long 
a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not 
for him a subaltern however it was flask alas was a butterless man another thing 
flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man 
up consider for hereby dinner was badly jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb 
both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging 
in the rear if stubb even who is but a peg higher than flask happens 
to have but a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then 
flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day for 
it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck therefore it 
was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the 
dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it was to 
be otherwise than hungry more or less for what he ate did not so much 
relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him peace and satisfaction thought flask have 
for ever departed from my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i 
could fish a bit of old fashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to 
when i was before the mast the fruits of promotion now the vanity of glory 
the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the 
pequod had a grudge against flask in official capacity all that sailor had to do 
in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinner time and get 
a peep at flask through the cabin sky light sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful 
ahab now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table 
in the cabin after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the 
canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid 
steward and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary 
legatees they made a sort of temporary hall of the high and mighty cabin in 
strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the table was 
the entire care free license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows 
the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges 
of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there 
was a report to it they dined like lords they filled their bellies like indian 
ships all day loading with spices such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego that to 
fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale dough boy was 
fain to bring on a great baron of salt junk seemingly quarried out of the 
solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go 
with a nimble hop skip and jump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating 
him by darting a fork at his back harpoon wise and once daggoo seized with 
a sudden humor assisted dough memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head 
into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the 
circle preliminary to scalping him he was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little 
fellow this bread faced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse 
and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous 
visitations of these three savages dough whole life was one continual lip quiver commonly after 
seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches 
into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of 
its door till all was over it was a sight to see queequeg seated over 
against tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the crosswise to them daggoo seated on the 
floor for a bench would have brought his hearse plumed head to the low carlines 
at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as 
when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship but for all this the great 
negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such 
comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad baronial and 
superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the 
abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of 
the worlds not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg 
he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in ugly sound much so that 
the trembling dough boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in 
his own lean arms and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to 
produce himself that his bones might be picked the simple witted steward all but shattered 
the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy 
nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their lances and 
other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that 
grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough boy how could he 
forget that in his island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of 
some murderous convivial indiscretions alas dough boy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon 
cannibals not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler in good 
time though to his great delight the three salt sea warriors would rise and depart 
to his credulous fable mongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every 
step like moorish scimetars in scabbards but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and 
nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were scarcely ever 
in it except at mealtimes and just before sleeping time when they passed through it 
to their own peculiar quarters in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most 
american whale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights 
the cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else 
is at any time permitted there so that in real truth the mates and harpooneers 
of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin 
than in it for when they did enter it it was something as a street 
door enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the 
next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air nor did they lose 
much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominally included 
in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he lived in 
the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri and as 
when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the woods burying himself in 
the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so 
in his inclement howling old age soul shut up in the caved trunk of his 
body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom chapter 35 the mast head 
it was during the more pleasant weather that in due rotation with the other seamen 
my first mast head came round in most american whalemen the mast heads are manned 
almost simultaneously with the leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand miles 
and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground and if after a three 
four or five voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in an empty 
vial her mast heads are kept manned to the last and not till her skysail 
poles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether relinquish the hope 
of capturing one whale more now as the business of standing mast heads ashore or 
afloat is a very ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate here 
i take it that the earliest standers of mast heads were the old egyptians because 
in all my researches i find none prior to them for though their progenitors the 
builders of babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiest mast 
head in all asia or africa either yet ere the final truck was put to 
it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by 
the board in the dread gale of wrath therefore we cannot give these babel builders 
priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians were a nation of mast head standers 
is an assertion based upon the general belief among archæologists that the first pyramids were 
founded for astronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair like formation of 
all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious long upliftings of their legs those 
old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars 
even as the look outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail or 
a whale just bearing in sight in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old 
times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole 
latter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with 
a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander of mast 
heads who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts rain 
hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to the last literally died at his 
post of modern standers of mast heads we have but a lifeless set mere stone 
iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are 
still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight there 
is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stands with arms folded 
some one hundred and fifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks 
below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil great washington too stands high 
aloft on his towering main mast in baltimore and like one of pillars his column 
marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go admiral nelson also 
on a capstan of gun metal stands his mast head in trafalgar square and ever 
when most obscured by that london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero 
is there for where there is smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor 
napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend 
by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised 
that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals 
and what rocks must be shunned it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect 
the mast head standers of the land with those of the sea but that in 
truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy 
the sole historian of nantucket stands accountable the worthy obed tells us that in the 
early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the 
game the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea coast to which 
the look outs ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in 
a hen house a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay 
whalemen of new zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the ready manned 
boats nigh the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to 
the one proper mast head that of a whale ship at sea the three mast 
heads are kept manned from sun rise to sun set the seamen taking their regular 
turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two hours in the serene 
weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast head nay to a dreamy 
meditative man it is delightful there you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks 
striding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and 
between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as 
ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes there you 
stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the waves 
the tranced ship indolently rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor 
for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests you you 
hear no news read no gazettes extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you 
into unnecessary excitements you hear of no domestic afflictions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are 
never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for all your meals for 
three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is 
immutable in one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four voyage as 
often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast head would 
amount to several entire months and it is much to be deplored that the place 
to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural 
life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted 
to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock 
a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small 
and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves your most usual point of perch 
is the head of the gallant mast where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks 
almost peculiar to whalemen called the gallant cross trees here tossed about by the sea 
the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a horns to be 
sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape 
of a watch coat but properly speaking the thickest watch coat is no more of 
a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside of its 
fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out of it 
without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in 
winter so a watch coat is not so much of a house as it is 
a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you cannot put a shelf or chest 
of drawers in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of 
your watch coat concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mast 
heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits 
called nests in which the look outs of a greenland whaler are protected from the 
inclement weather of the frozen seas in the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled voyage 
among the icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the re discovery 
of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in this admirable volume all standers of 
mast heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented nest 
of the glacier which was the name of captain good craft he called it the 
nest in honor of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from 
all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our 
own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so likewise should we denominate 
after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget in shape the nest is something like 
a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with 
a movable side screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale 
being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little 
trap hatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the stern of 
the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas comforters and coats 
in front is a leather rack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope 
and other nautical conveniences when captain sleet in person stood his mast head in this 
nest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle with him also 
fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of 
popping off the stray narwhales or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannot 
successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but 
to shoot down upon them is a very different thing now it was plainly a 
labor of love for captain sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed 
conveniences of his nest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and though 
he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this nest with 
a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from 
what is called the of all binnacle magnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity 
of the iron in the planks and in the case perhaps to there having been 
so many broken down blacksmiths among her crew i say that though the captain is 
very discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned deviations compass observations and errors 
he knows very well captain sleet that he was not so much immersed in those 
profound magnetic meditations as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case 
bottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his nest within easy reach of 
his hand though upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the 
honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he should 
so utterly ignore that case bottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must 
have been while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft 
there in that nest within three or four perches of the pole but if we 
southern whale fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenlandmen 
were yet that disadvantage is greatly counter balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those 
seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float for one i used to lounge 
up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg 
or any one else off duty whom i might find there then ascending a little 
way further and throwing a lazy leg over the top sail yard take a preliminary 
view of the watery pastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destination let 
me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but 
sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how could left completely 
to myself at such a thought engendering could i but lightly hold my obligations to 
observe all whale standing orders your weather eye open and sing out every time and 
let me in this place movingly admonish you ye ship owners of nantucket beware of 
enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to 
unseasonable meditativeness and who offers to ship with the phædon instead of bowditch in his 
head beware of such an one i say your whales must be seen before they 
can be killed and this sunken eyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes round 
the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor are these 
monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whale fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic 
melancholy and absent minded young men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking 
sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast head 
of some luckless disappointed whale ship and in moody phrase ejaculates on thou deep and 
dark blue ocean roll ten thousand blubber hunters sweep over thee in vain very often 
do the captains of such ships take those absent minded young philosophers to task upbraiding 
them with not feeling sufficient in the voyage half hinting that they are so hopelessly 
lost to all honorable ambition as that in their secret souls they would rather not 
see whales than otherwise but all in vain those young platonists have a notion that 
their vision is imperfect they are short sighted what use then to strain the visual 
nerve they have left their opera glasses at home thou monkey said a harpooneer to 
one of these lads been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not 
raised a whale yet whales are scarce as teeth whenever thou art up here perhaps 
they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon 
but lulled into such an opium like listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absent 
minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses 
his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that 
deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange half seen gliding beautiful 
thing that eludes him every dimly discovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to 
him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting 
through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came becomes 
diffused through time and space like sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of 
every shore the round globe over there is no life in thee now except that 
rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by 
the sea from the inscrutable tides of god but while this sleep this dream is 
on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and 
your identity comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover and perhaps at mid 
day in the fairest weather with one half throttled shriek you drop through that transparent 
air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever heed it well ye 
pantheists chapter 36 the quarter deck enter ahab then all it was not a great 
while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab as 
was his wont ascended the cabin gangway to the deck there most sea captains usually 
walk at that hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns 
in the garden soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he 
paced his old rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all 
over dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did you fixedly 
gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger 
foot foot prints of his one unsleeping ever pacing thought but on the occasion in 
question those dents looked deeper even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper 
mark and so full of his thought was ahab that at every uniform turn that 
he made now at the main mast and now at the binnacle you could almost 
see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he 
paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of 
every outer movement mark him flask whispered stubb chick in him pecks the shell soon 
be out the hours wore on now shut up within his cabin anon pacing the 
deck with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect it drew near the 
close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks and inserting his 
bone leg into the auger hole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he 
ordered starbuck to send everybody aft said the mate astonished at an order seldom or 
never given on ship board except in some extraordinary case everybody aft repeated ahab heads 
there come down when the entire company were assembled and with curious and not wholly 
unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a 
storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his 
eyes among the crew started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were 
nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and half slouched 
hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubb 
cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of 
witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried do 
ye do when ye see a whale men out for him was the impulsive rejoinder 
from a score of clubbed voices cried ahab with a wild approval in his tones 
observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them what 
do ye next men away and after him what tune is it ye pull to 
men dead whale or a stove boat more and more strangely and fiercely glad and 
approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began 
to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they themselves 
became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions but they were all eagerness again as 
ahab now half revolving in his pivot hole with one hand reaching high up a 
shroud and tightly almost convulsively grasping it addressed them thus ye mast headers have before 
now heard me give orders about a white whale look ye see this spanish ounce 
of gold up a broad bright coin to the is a sixteen dollar piece men 
see it mr starbuck hand me yon top maul while the mate was getting the 
hammer ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his 
jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly 
humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the 
mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him receiving the top maul from 
starbuck he advanced towards the main mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting 
the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming of ye raises 
me a white headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of 
ye raises me that white headed whale with three holes punctured in his starboard ye 
whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce 
my boys huzza cried the seamen as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of 
nailing the gold to the mast a white whale i say resumed ahab as he 
threw down the topmaul white whale skin your eyes for him men look sharp for 
white water if ye see but a bubble sing out all this while tashtego daggoo 
and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest 
and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as 
if each was separately touched by some specific recollection ahab said tashtego white whale must 
be the same that some call moby dick dick shouted ahab ye know the white 
whale then tash he fan tail a little curious sir before he goes down said 
the gay header deliberately has he a curious spout too said daggoo bushy even for 
a parmacetty and mighty quick captain ahab he have one two good many iron in 
him hide too captain cried queequeg disjointedly twiske tee be twisk like faltering hard for 
a word and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a cried ahab 
queequeg the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is 
a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of 
our nantucket wool after the great annual sheep shearing aye tashtego and he fan tails 
like a split jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick 
ye have dick ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far been 
eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which 
somewhat explained all the wonder ahab i have heard of moby it was not moby 
dick that took off thy leg told thee that cried ahab then pausing starbuck aye 
my hearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought 
me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with a 
terrific loud animal sob like that of a heart stricken moose aye it was that 
accursed white whale that razed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever 
and a day then tossing both arms with measureless imprecations he shouted out aye and 
chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and 
round flames before i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for 
men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides 
of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out what say ye men 
will ye splice hands on it now i think ye do look brave aye shouted 
the harpooneers and seamen running closer to the excited old man sharp eye for the 
white whale a sharp lance for moby dick bless ye he seemed to half sob 
and half shout bless ye men steward go draw the great measure of grog but 
this long face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not 
game for moby dick am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of 
death too captain ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we 
follow but i came here to hunt whales not my vengeance how many barrels will 
thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it will not fetch 
thee much in our nantucket market market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest a 
little lower layer if to be the measurer man and the accountants have computed their 
great counting house the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts 
of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great 
premium here smites his chest whispered stubb that for methinks it rings most vast but 
hollow on a dumb brute cried starbuck simply smote thee from blindest instinct madness to 
be enraged with a dumb thing captain ahab seems blasphemous ye yet little lower layer 
all visible objects man are but as pasteboard masks but in each the living act 
the undoubted some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features 
from behind the unreasoning mask if man will strike strike through the mask how can 
the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale 
is that wall shoved near to me sometimes i think naught beyond but enough he 
tasks me he heaps me i see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice 
sinewing it that inscrutable thing is chiefly what i hate and be the white whale 
agent or be the white whale principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk 
not to me of blasphemy man strike the sun if it insulted me for could 
the sun do that then could i do the other since there is ever a 
sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creations but not my master man 
is even that fair play over me truth hath no confines take off thine eye 
more intolerable than glarings is a doltish stare so so thou reddenest and palest my 
heat has melted thee to anger glow but look ye starbuck what is said in 
heat that thing unsays itself there are men from whom warm words are small indignity 
i meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkish cheeks of 
spotted breathing pictures painted by the sun the pagan unrecking and unworshipping things that live 
and seek and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel the crew man 
the crew are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the 
whale see stubb he laughs see yonder chilian he snorts to think of it stand 
up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot starbuck and what is it 
reckon it but to help strike a fin no wondrous feat for starbuck what is 
it more from this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all nantucket 
surely he will not hang back when every foremast hand has clutched a whetstone ah 
constrainings seize thee i see the billow lifts thee speak but speak aye thy silence 
then that voices thee aside something shot from my dilated nostrils he has inhaled it 
in his lungs starbuck now is mine cannot oppose me now without rebellion keep me 
us all murmured starbuck lowly but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of 
the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from 
the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet 
the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts 
sank in for again downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean 
laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and 
rolled as before ah ye admonitions and warnings why stay ye not when ye come 
but rather are ye predictions than warnings ye shadows yet not so much predictions from 
without as verifications of the foregoing things within for with little external to constrain us 
the innermost necessities in our being these still drive us on measure the measure cried 
ahab receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he ordered them to produce 
their weapons then ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoons in their 
hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest 
of the company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly 
eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot 
eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on 
at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into 
the hidden snare of the indian and pass he cried handing the heavy charged flagon 
to the nearest seaman crew alone now drink round with it round short swallows men 
hot as hoof so so it goes round excellently it spiralizes in ye forks out 
at the serpent snapping eye well done almost drained that way it went this way 
it comes hand it a hollow men ye seem the years so brimming life is 
gulped and gone steward refill now my braves i have mustered ye all round this 
capstan and ye mates flank me with your lances and ye harpooneers stand there with 
your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that i may in some sort 
revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me o men you will yet 
see boy come back bad pennies come not sooner hand it me why now this 
pewter had run brimming again not thou st thou ague ye mates cross your lances 
full before me well done let me touch the axis so saying with extended arm 
he grasped the three level radiating lances at their crossed centre while so doing suddenly 
and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask 
it seemed as though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into 
them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic life 
the three mates quailed before his strong sustained and mystic aspect stubb and flask looked 
sideways from him the honest eye of starbuck fell downright vain cried ahab maybe well 
for did ye three but once take the full forced shock then mine own electric 
thing that had perhaps expired from out me perchance too it would have dropped ye 
dead perchance ye need it not down lances and now ye mates i do appoint 
ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen my 
valiant harpooneers disdain the task what when the great pope washes the feet of beggars 
using his tiara for ewer oh my sweet cardinals your own condescension that shall bend 
ye to it i do not order ye ye will it cut your seizings and 
draw the poles ye harpooneers silently obeying the order the three harpooneers now stood with 
the detached iron part of their harpoons some three feet long held barbs up before 
him me not with that keen steel cant them cant them over know ye not 
the goblet end turn up the socket so so now ye cup bearers advance the 
irons take them hold them while i fill forthwith slowly going from one officer to 
the other he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter three 
to three ye stand commend the murderous chalices bestow them ye who are now made 
parties to this indissoluble league ha starbuck but the deed is done yon ratifying sun 
now waits to sit upon it drink ye harpooneers drink and swear ye men that 
man the deathful to moby dick god hunt us all if we do not hunt 
moby dick to his death the long barbed steel goblets were lifted and to cries 
and maledictions against the white whale the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss 
starbuck paled and turned and shivered once more and finally the replenished pewter went the 
rounds among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all dispersed 
and ahab retired within his cabin chapter 37 sunset the cabin by the stern windows 
ahab sitting alone and gazing out i leave a white and turbid wake pale waters

i ishmael was one of that crew my shouts had gone up with the rest 
my oath had been welded with theirs and stronger i shouted and more did i 
hammer and clinch my oath because of the dread in my soul a wild mystical 
sympathetical feeling was in me quenchless feud seemed mine with greedy ears i learned the 
history of that murderous monster against whom i and all the others had taken our 
oaths of violence and revenge for some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied 
secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale fishermen 
but not all of them knew of his existence only a few of them comparatively 
had knowingly seen him while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given 
battle to him was small indeed for owing to the large number of whale cruisers 
the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference many of them adventurously 
pushing their quest along solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth 
or more on a stretch to encounter a single news telling sail of any sort 
the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the times of sailing from 
home all these with other circumstances direct and indirect long obstructed the spread through the 
whole world wide whaling fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick it was 
hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have encountered at such or such 
a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude 
and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailants had completely escaped them 
to some minds it was not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in 
question must have been no other than moby dick yet as of late the sperm 
whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity cunning 
and malice in the monster attacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantly 
gave battle to moby dick such hunters perhaps for the most part were content to 
ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more as it were to the perils of the 
sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual cause in that way mostly the 
disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded and as for 
those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance caught sight of him in 
the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost as boldly and 
fearlessly lowered for him as for any other whale of that species but at length 
such calamities did ensue in these restricted to sprained wrists and ankles broken limbs or 
devouring fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and 
piling their terrors upon moby dick those things had gone far to shake the fortitude 
of many brave hunters to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come 
nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify 
the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow 
out of the very body of all surprising terrible events the smitten tree gives birth 
to its fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma 
wild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and 
as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every 
other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes 
circulate there for not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and 
superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the 
most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to 
face they not only eye its greatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to 
them alone in such remotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed 
a thousand shores you would not come to any chiseled hearth stone or aught hospitable 
beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too such a 
calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his 
fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth no wonder then that ever gathering volume from 
the mere transit over the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale 
did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and half formed 
fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from 
anything that visibly appears so that in many cases such a panic did he finally 
strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the white whale 
few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw but there 
were still other and more vital practical influences at work not even at the present 
day has the original prestige of the sperm whale as fearfully distinguished from all other 
species of the leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body 
there are those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous enough in offering 
battle to the greenland or right whale would from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity 
decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are plenty of whalemen 
especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the american flag who have never hostilely 
encountered the sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the 
ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their hatches these men will hearken 
with a childish fireside interest and awe to the wild strange tales of southern whaling 
nor is the pre eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended 
than on board of those prows which stem him and as if the now tested 
reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it we 
find some book and the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every 
other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to 
be athirst for human blood nor even down to so late a time as were 
these or almost similar impressions effaced for in his natural history the baron himself affirms 
that at sight of the sperm whale all fish sharks included are with the most 
lively terrors and in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with 
such violence as to cause instantaneous death and however the general experiences in the fishery 
may amend such reports as these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty 
item of povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation 
revived in the minds of the hunters so that overawed by the rumors and portents 
concerning him not a few of the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the 
earlier days of the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long 
practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare such 
men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point 
lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man that 
to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this 
head there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted nevertheless some there were who 
even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to moby dick 
and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely 
without the specific details of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy 
not to flee from the battle if offered one of the wild suggestions referred to 
as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of 
the superstitiously inclined was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he had 
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time nor 
credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether without some faint show 
of superstitious probability for as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never 
yet been divulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the 
sperm whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his pursuers and 
from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them especially 
concerning the mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth he transports himself with 
such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points it is a thing well known 
to both american and english whale ships and as well a thing placed upon authoritative 
record years ago by scoresby that some whales have been captured far north in the 
pacific in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland 
seas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it has 
been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded 
very many days hence by inference it has been believed by some whalemen that the 
west passage so long a problem to man was never a problem to the whale 
so that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigies related in 
old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there was said 
to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface 
and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse whose waters were 
believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage these fabulous narrations 
are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen forced into familiarity then with 
such prodigies as these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale had 
escaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still 
further in their superstitions declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is 
but ubiquity in time that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks 
he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to 
spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in 
unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would once more be seen but 
even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable 
character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power for it was not 
so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales but 
as was elsewhere thrown peculiar snow white wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump 
these were his prominent features the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he 
revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him the rest of 
his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that 
in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale a name 
indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a 
dark blue sea leaving a milky way wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden 
gleamings nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his deformed 
lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror as that unexampled intelligent 
malignity which according to specific accounts he had over and over again evinced in his 
assaults more than all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else 
for when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm he had 
several times been known to turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave 
their boats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship already several 
fatalities had attended his chase but though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by 
no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white infernal 
aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded 
as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent judge then to what pitches of inflamed 
distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips 
of chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the 
white curds of the direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on as 
if at a birth or a bridal his three boats stove around him and oars 
and men both whirling in the eddies one captain seizing the line knife from his 
broken prow had dashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly 
seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom deep life of the whale 
that captain was ahab and then it was that suddenly sweeping his sickle shaped lower 
jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away leg as a mower a blade of 
grass in the field no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay could have smote 
him with more seeming malice small reason was there to doubt then that ever since 
that almost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the 
more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with 
him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations the 
white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which 
some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half 
a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning 
to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe one half of the worlds which the 
ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil did not fall down and 
worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he 
pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and torments all that stirs 
up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the 
sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil 
to crazy ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in moby dick he piled 
upon the white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by 
his whole race from adam down and then as if his chest had been a 
mortar he burst his hot shell upon it it is not probable that this monomania 
in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment then 
in darting at the monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a 
sudden passionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he probably 
but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more yet when by this collision forced 
to turn towards home and for long months of days and weeks ahab and anguish 
lay stretched together in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape 
then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another and 
so interfusing made him mad that it was only then on the homeward voyage after 
the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems all but certain from the fact 
that at intervals during the passage he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of 
a leg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and was moreover 
intensified by his delirium that his mates were forced to lace him fast even there 
as he sailed raving in his hammock in a strait jacket he swung to the 
mad rockings of the gales and when running into more sufferable latitudes the ship with 
mild spread floated across the tranquil tropics and to all appearances the old delirium seemed 
left behind him with the cape horn swells and he came forth from his dark 
den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that firm collected 
front however pale and issued his calm orders once again and his mates thanked god 
the direful madness was now gone even then ahab in his hidden self raved on 
human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled 
it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form full lunacy subsided not 
but deepeningly contracted like the unabated hudson when that noble northman flows narrowly but unfathomably 
through the highland gorge but as in his narrow flowing monomania not one jot of 
broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of 
his great natural intellect had perished that before living agent now became the living instrument 
if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and 
carried it and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that 
far from having lost his strength ahab to that one end did now possess a 
thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one 
reasonable object this is much yet larger darker deeper part remains unhinted but vain to 
popularize profundities and all truth is profound winding far down from within the very heart 
of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here grand and wonderful now quit it 
take your way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman halls of thermes where 
far beneath the fantastic towers of upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful 
essence sits in bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquities and throned on torsoes so 
with a broken throne the great gods mock that captive king so like a caryatid 
he patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages wind ye 
down there ye prouder sadder souls question that proud sad king a family likeness aye 
he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and from your grim sire only will 
the old state secret come now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this 
namely all my means are sane my motive and my object mad yet without power 
to kill or change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he 
did long dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling was 
only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate nevertheless so well did he 
succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no 
nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the 
terrible casualty which had overtaken him the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was 
likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which 
always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage 
sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting 
his fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people 
of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons 
he was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full 
of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within and scorched without 
with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea such an one could he be 
found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against 
the most appalling of all brutes or if for any reason thought to be corporeally 
incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl 
on his underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it 
is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in 
him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all 
engrossing object of hunting the white whale had any one of his old acquaintances on 
shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then how soon would their 
aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man they were 
bent on profitable cruises the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint 
he was intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge here then was this grey 
headed ungodly old man chasing with curses a whale round the world at the head 
of a crew too chiefly made up of mongrel renegades and castaways and enfeebled also 
by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right mindedness in starbuck the invulnerable jollity 
of indifference and recklessness in stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew 
so officered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to 
his monomaniac revenge how it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old what 
evil magic their souls were possessed that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the 
white whale as much their insufferable foe as his how all this came to the 
white whale was to them or how to their unconscious understandings also in some dim 
unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life 
this to explain would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go the subterranean miner 
that works in us all how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the 
ever shifting muffled sound of his pick who does not feel the irresistible arm drag 
what skiff in tow of a seventy four can stand still for one i gave 
myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all 
a rush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest 
ill chapter 42 the whiteness of the whale what the white whale was to ahab 
has been hinted what at times he was to me as yet remains unsaid aside 
from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick which could not but occasionally awaken in 
any soul some alarm there was another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him 
which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest and yet so mystical 
and well nigh ineffable was it that i almost despair of putting it in a 
comprehensible form it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me 
but how can i hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random 
way explain myself i must else all these chapters might be naught though in many 
natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beauty as if imparting some special virtue of its own 
as in marbles japonicas and pearls and though various nations have in some way recognised 
a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old kings of pegu 
placing the title of the white above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and 
the modern kings of siam unfurling the same snow white quadruped in the royal standard 
and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow white charger and the 
great austrian empire cæsarian heir to overlording rome having for the imperial colour the same 
imperial hue and though this pre eminence in it applies to the human race itself 
giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this 
whiteness has been even made significant of gladness for among the romans a white stone 
marked a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings this same hue 
is made the emblem of many touching noble innocence of brides the benignity of age 
though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum 
was the deepest pledge of honor though in many climes whiteness typifies the majesty of 
justice in the ermine of the judge and contributes to the daily state of kings 
and queens drawn by milk white steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the 
most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power 
by the persian fire worshippers the white forked flame being held the holiest on the 
altar and in the greek mythologies great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow 
white bull and though to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white 
dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful creature being 
held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings 
of their own fidelity and though directly from the latin word for white all christian 
priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic 
worn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith white 
is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though in the 
vision of st john white robes are given to the redeemed and the four and 
twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne and the holy one 
that sitteth there white like wool yet for all these accumulated associations with whatever is 
sweet and honorable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea 
of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which 
affrights in blood this elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when 
divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any object terrible in itself to heighten 
that terror to the furthest bounds witness the white bear of the poles and the 
white shark of the tropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent 
horrors they are that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even 
more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect so that not the 
fierce fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white shrouded 
bear or shark with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by 
him who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the 
whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened 
hideousness it might be said only rises from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousness of 
the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by 
bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds the polar bear frightens us with 
so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true yet were it 
not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified terror as for the white 
shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary 
moods strangely tallies with the same quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is most 
vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish 
mass for the dead begins with eternal rest whence requiem denominating the mass itself and 
any other funeral music now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in 
this shark and the mild deadliness of his habits the french call him requin bethink 
thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread in 
which that white phantom sails in all imaginations not coleridge first threw that spell but 
great unflattering laureate nature i remember the first albatross i ever saw it was during 
a prolonged gale in waters hard upon the antarctic seas from my forenoon watch below 
i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatches i saw 
a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked roman bill sublime at 
intervals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark 
wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered cries as some ghost 
in supernatural distress through its inexpressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which took 
hold of god as abraham before the angels i bowed myself the white thing was 
so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled waters i had 
lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns long i gazed at that 
prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can only hint the things that darted through me 
then but at last i awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird was this 
a goney he replied goney never had heard that name before is it conceivable that 
this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i 
learned that goney was some name for albatross so that by no possibility could wild 
rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine when i 
saw that bird upon our deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor 
knew the bird to be an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly 
burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet i assert 
then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of 
the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of terms 
there are birds called grey albatrosses and these i have frequently seen but never with 
such emotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl but how had the mystic thing 
been caught whisper it not and i will tell with a treacherous hook and line 
as the fowl floated on the sea at last the captain made a postman of 
it tying a lettered leathern tally round its neck with the time and place and 
then letting it escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was 
taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wing folding the 
invoking and adoring cherubim most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that 
of the white steed of the prairies a magnificent milk white charger large eyed small 
headed bluff chested and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning 
carriage he was the elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in 
those days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies at their flaming 
head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the 
hosts of light the flashing cascade of his mane the curving comet of his tail 
invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silver beaters could have furnished him 
a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eyes 
of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when adam 
walked majestic as a god bluff browed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching 
amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it 
over the plains like an ohio or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around 
at the horizon the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his 
cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the bravest indians he was 
the object of trembling reverence and awe nor can it be questioned from what stands 
on legendary record of this noble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which 
so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though 
commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror but there are other 
instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and strange glory which invests it in 
the white steed and albatross what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly 
repels and often shocks the eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own 
kith and kin it is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the 
name he bears the albino is as well made as other no substantive yet this 
mere aspect of all pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion 
why should this be so nor in quite other aspects does nature in her least 
palpable but not the less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces this crowning 
attribute of the terrible from its snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas 
has been denominated the white squall nor in some historic instances has the art of 
human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of that 
passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperate white 
hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the market place nor in some things does 
the common hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of 
this hue it cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect 
of the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering there as 
if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other 
world as of mortal trepidation here and from that pallor of the dead we borrow 
the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them nor even in our 
superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts 
rising in a milk white while these terrors seize us let us add that even 
the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on his pallid horse therefore 
in his other moods symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness no 
man can deny that in its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition 
to the soul but though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man 
to account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then by the 
citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of for the time either wholly 
or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught 
fearful but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however modified we 
thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause 
we seek let us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety 
and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls and though doubtless some 
at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by 
most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore 
may not be able to recall them now why to the man of untutored ideality 
who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does 
the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless processions of 
slow pacing pilgrims down cast and hooded with new fallen snow or to the unread 
unsophisticated protestant of the middle american states why does the passing mention of a white 
friar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul or what 
is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly 
account for it that makes the white tower of london tell so much more strongly 
on the imagination of an untravelled american than those other storied structures its byward tower 
or even the bloody and those sublimer towers the white mountains of new hampshire whence 
in peculiar moods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of 
that name while the thought of blue ridge is full of a soft dewy distant 
dreaminess or why irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes does the name of the white 
sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lulls 
us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by the 
gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed 
to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of central europe does tall 
pale of the hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the 
is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the blocksburg nor is 
it altogether the remembrance of her cathedral toppling earthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic 
seas nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her 
wide field of leaning spires wrenched cope stones and crosses all adroop like canted yards 
of anchored fleets and her suburban avenues of house walls lying over upon each other 
as a tossed pack of cards is not these things alone which make tearless lima 
the strangest saddest city thou see for lima has taken the white veil and there 
is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarro this whiteness 
keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spreads 
over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions 
i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to 
be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible nor to the 
unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind 
almost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under any form at all 
approaching to muteness or universality what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be 
respectively elucidated by the following examples first the mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of 
foreign lands if by night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and 
feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but under precisely similar circumstances 
let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight 
sea of milky if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round 
him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters 
is horrible to him as a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he 
is still off soundings heart and helm they both go down he never rests till 
blue water is under him again yet where is the mariner who will tell thee 
it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of 
that hideous whiteness that so stirred me second to the native indian of peru the 
continual sight of the snow howdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the 
mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes and the natural 
conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes 
much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference 
views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to 
break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the 
antarctic seas where at times by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of 
frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace 
to his misery views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean 
ice monuments and splintered crosses but thou sayest methinks that white lead chapter about whiteness 
is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou surrenderest to a 
hypo ishmael tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of 
vermont far removed from all beasts of is it that upon the sunniest day if 
you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see 
it but only smells its wild animal will he start snort and with bursting eyes 
paw the ground in phrensies of affright there is no remembrance in him of any 
gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he 
smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils for what 
knows he this new england colt of the black bisons of distant oregon no but 
here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the 
demonism in the world though thousands of miles from oregon still when he smells that 
savage musk the rending goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild 
foal of the prairies which this instant they may be trampling into dust thus then 
the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of 
mountains the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies all these to ishmael are 
as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt though neither knows where 
lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints yet with 
me as with the colt somewhere those things must exist though in many of its 
aspects this visible world seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in fright 
but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it 
appeals with such power to the soul and more strange and far more as we 
have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the 
very veil of the deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent 
in things the most appalling to mankind is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows 
forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind 
with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky way or 
is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the 
visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all colours is 
it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in 
a wide landscape of colourless all colour of atheism from which we shrink and when 
we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers that all other earthly stately or 
lovely sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gilded velvets of butterflies 
and the butterfly cheeks of young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually 
inherent in substances but only laid on from without so that all deified nature absolutely 
paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel house within and when 
we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her 
hues the great principle of light for ever remains white or colorless in itself and 
if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objects even tulips and roses with 
its own blank all this the palsied universe lies before us a leper and like 
wilful travellers in lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes 
so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all 
the prospect around him and of all these things the albino whale was the symbol 
wonder ye then at the fiery hunt chapter 43 hark did you hear that noise 
cabaco it was the middle watch a fair moonlight the seamen were standing in a 
cordon extending from one of the fresh water butts in the waist to the scuttle 
butt near the taffrail in this manner they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle 
butt standing for the most part on the hallowed precincts of the quarter deck they 
were careful not to speak or rustle their feet from hand to hand the buckets 
went in the deepest silence only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and 
the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel it was in the midst of this 
repose that archy one of the cordon whose post was near the after hatches whispered 
to his neighbor a cholo the words above did you hear that noise cabaco the 
bucket will ye archy what noise mean it is the you hear sounded like a 
cough be damned pass along that return bucket it is sounds like two or three 
sleepers turning over now have done shipmate will ye the three soaked biscuits ye eat 
for supper turning over inside of else look to the bucket what ye will shipmate 
sharp ears you are the chap ye that heard the hum of the old knitting 
needles fifty miles at sea from nantucket the chap away see what turns up hark 
ye cabaco there is somebody down in the after hold that has not yet been 
seen on deck and i suspect our old mogul knows something of it too i 
heard stubb tell flask one morning watch that there was something of that sort in 
the wind the bucket chapter 44 the chart had you followed captain ahab down into 
his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification 
of his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker 
in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread 
them before him on his screwed down table then seating himself before it you would 
have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye 
and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank 
at intervals he would refer to piles of old log books beside him wherein were 
set down the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various ships 
sperm whales had been captured or seen while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended 
in chains over his head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for 
ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow till it almost 
seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts 
some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of 
his forehead but it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of 
his cabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they were brought out 
almost every night some pencil marks were effaced and others were substituted for with the 
charts of all four oceans before him ahab was threading a maze of currents and 
eddies with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his 
soul now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans it 
might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the 
unhooped oceans of this planet but not so did it seem to ahab who knew 
the sets of all tides and currents and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm 
food and also calling to mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular 
latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching to certainties concerning the timeliest day to 
be upon this or that ground in search of his prey so assured indeed is 
the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm resorting to given waters that many hunters 
believe that could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the logs 
for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated then the migrations of the 
sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring shoals 
or the flights of swallows on this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate 
migratory charts of the sperm whale since the above was written the statement is happily 
borne out by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national observatory washington 
april 16th 1851 by that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in 
course of completion and portions of it are presented in the circular chart divides the 
ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude perpendicularly through 
each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each 
of which districts are three lines one to show the number of days that have 
been spent in each month in every district and the two others to show the 
number of days in which whales sperm or right have been seen besides when making 
a passage from one feeding ground to another the sperm whales guided by some infallible 
rather secret intelligence from the swim in veins as they are called continuing their way 
along a given ocean line with such undeviating exactitude that no ship ever sailed her 
course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these cases 
the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a parallel and though the 
line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary 
vein in which at these times he is said to swim generally embraces some few 
miles in width more or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract 
but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale mast heads when circumspectly gliding along 
this magic zone the sum is that at particular seasons within that breadth and along 
that path migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for and hence not only 
at substantiated times upon well known separate feeding grounds could ahab hope to encounter his 
prey but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by 
his art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to 
be wholly without prospect of a meeting there was a circumstance which at first sight 
seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality 
perhaps though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds yet in 
general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or 
longitude this year say will turn out to be identically the same with those that 
were found there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the 
contrary of this has proved true in general the same remark only within a less 
wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so 
that though moby dick had in a former year been seen for example on what 
is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese 
coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit either of those 
spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there so too with 
some other feeding grounds where he had at times revealed himself but all these seemed 
only his casual stopping places and ocean inns so to speak not his places of 
prolonged abode and where chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of allusion 
has only been made to whatever way side antecedent extra prospects were his ere a 
particular set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become probabilities and as 
ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty that particular set time 
and place were conjoined in the one technical season on the line for there and 
then for several consecutive years moby dick had been periodically descried lingering in those waters 
for awhile as the sun in its annual round loiters for a predicted interval in 
any one sign of the zodiac there it was too that most of the deadly 
encounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves were storied with his 
deeds there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the 
awful motive to his vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which 
ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt he would not permit himself to 
rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might 
be to those hopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize 
his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest now the pequod had sailed from 
nantucket at the very beginning of the season on the line no possible endeavor then 
could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then 
running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise 
there therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season yet the premature hour of 
the sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very 
complexion of things because an interval of three hundred and sixty five days and nights 
was before him an interval which instead of impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in 
a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale spending his vacation in seas far 
remote from his periodical feeding grounds should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian 
gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other waters haunted 
by his race so that monsoons pampas westers harmattans trades any wind but the levanter 
and simoon might blow moby dick into the devious zig zag world circle of the 
circumnavigating wake but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but 
a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if 
encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a white 
bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople yes for the peculiar snow white brow 
of moby dick and his snow white hump could not but be unmistakable and have 
i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter to himself as after poring over his 
charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in him and shall he 
escape his broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost ear and here 
his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness 
of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would 
seek to recover his strength ah god what trances of torments does that man endure 
who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakes 
with his own bloody nails in his palms often when forced from his hammock by 
exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts through 
the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them round and 
round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing of his life spot 
became insufferable anguish and when as was sometimes the case these spiritual throes in him 
heaved his being up from its base and a chasm seemed opening in him from 
which forked flames and lightnings shot up and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down 
among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be 
heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state room 
as though escaping from a bed that was on fire yet these perhaps instead of 
being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were 
but the plainest tokens of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab the scheming 
unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that had gone to his hammock 
was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again 
the latter was the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being 
for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind which at other times employed it for 
its outer vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the 
frantic thing of which for the time it was no longer an integral but as 
the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore it must have been 
that in case yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose 
that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against gods and devils 
into a kind of self assumed independent being of its own nay could grimly live 
and burn while the common vitality to which it was conjoined fled horror stricken from 
the unbidden and unfathered birth therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes 
when what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated 
thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without 
an object to colour and therefore a blankness in itself god help thee old man 
thy thoughts have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes 
him a prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the very 
creature he creates chapter 45 the affidavit so far as what there may be of 
a narrative in this book and indeed as indirectly touching one or two very interesting 
and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in its earlier 
part is as important a one as will be found in this volume but the 
leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon in 
order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound 
ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verity 
of the main points of this affair i care not to perform this part of 
my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations 
of items practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from these citations 
i take conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself first i have personally known 
three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and 
after an interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the 
same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher 
have been taken from the body in the instance where three years intervened between the 
flinging of the two harpoons and i think it may have been something more than 
that the man who darted them happening in the interval to go in a trading 
ship on a voyage to africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated 
far into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years often 
endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas with all the other common perils incident to 
wandering in the heart of unknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also 
have been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with 
its flanks all the coasts of africa but to no purpose this man and this 
whale again came together and the one vanquished the other i say i myself have 
known three instances similar to this that is in two of them i saw the 
whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two irons with the respective marks 
cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish in the three year instance it 
so fell out that i was in the boat both times first and last and 
the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the eye which 
i had observed there three years previous i say three years but i am pretty 
sure it was more than that here are three instances then which i personally know 
the truth of but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity 
in the matter there is no good ground to impeach secondly it is well known 
in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that 
there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has 
been at distant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale became thus marked 
was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales 
for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an 
end to his peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable 
oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there 
hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about rinaldo 
rinaldini insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins 
when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate 
a more intimate acquaintance like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible 
great man they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they 
pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption but not 
only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual you may call it an 
ocean wide renown not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in 
forecastle stories after death but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions 
of a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or cæsar was it 
not so o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long 
lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the 
palmy beach of ombay was it not so o new zealand jack thou terror of 
all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the tattoo land was it 
not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty jet they say at times assumed 
the semblance of a snow white cross against the sky was it not so o 
don miguel thou chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the 
back in plain prose here are four whales as well known to the students of 
cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar but this is not all 
new zealand tom and don miguel after at various times creating great havoc among the 
boats of different vessels were finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and 
killed by valiant whaling captains who heaved up their anchors with that express object as 
much in view as in setting out through the narragansett woods captain butler of old 
had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior 
of the indian king philip i do not know where i can find a better 
place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to 
me seem important as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the 
whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for this is one of 
those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error so ignorant are 
most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that 
without some hints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the fishery they might 
scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a 
hideous and intolerable allegory first though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the 
general perils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid conception 
of those perils and the frequency with which they recur one reason perhaps is that 
not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery 
ever finds a public record at home however transient and immediately forgotten that record do 
you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whale 
line off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the bottom of 
the sea by the sounding you suppose that that poor name will appear in the 
newspaper obituary you will read to morrow at your breakfast no because the mails are 
very irregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what might 
be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet i tell you that 
upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many others we spoke 
thirty different ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some 
of them more than one and three that had each lost a crew for sake 
be economical with your lamps and candles not a gallon you burn but at least 
one drop of blood was spilled for it secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite 
idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever 
found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two fold enormousness they 
have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness when i declare upon my soul i had 
no more idea of being facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the 
plagues of egypt but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon 
testimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm whale is in 
some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in 
utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale has 
done it first in the year 1820 the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket was 
cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spouts lowered her boats and gave 
chase to a shoal of sperm whales ere long several of the whales were wounded 
when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and 
bore directly down upon the ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove 
her in that in less than she settled down and fell over not a surviving 
plank of her has been seen since after the severest exposure part of the crew 
reached the land in their boats being returned home at last captain pollard once more 
sailed for the pacific in command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again 
upon unknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and 
forthwith forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since at this day captain pollard 
is a resident of nantucket i have seen owen chace who was chief mate of 
the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his plain and faithful 
narrative i have conversed with his son and all this within a few miles of 
the scene of the catastrophe the following are extracts from narrative fact seemed to warrant 
me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations he made 
two several attacks upon the ship at a short interval between them both of which 
according to their direction were calculated to do us the most injury by being made 
ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock to effect 
which the exact manœuvres which he made were necessary his aspect was most horrible and 
such as indicated resentment and fury he came directly from the shoal which we had 
just before entered and in which we had struck three of his companions as if 
fired with revenge for their sufferings again all events the whole circumstances taken together all 
happening before my own eyes and producing at the time impressions in my mind of 
decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impressions i cannot 
now recall induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion here 
are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during a black night in an 
open boat when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore dark ocean and swelling waters 
were nothing the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon 
hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to 
a thought the dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale 
wholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance in another 45 speaks of 
the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal secondly the ship union also of nantucket 
was in the year 1807 totally lost off the azores by a similar onset but 
the authentic particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter though from the 
whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions to it thirdly some eighteen 
or twenty years ago commodore then commanding an american sloop of war of the first 
class happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket 
ship in the harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whales the commodore was 
pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen 
present he peremptorily denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloop 
of war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful very good 
but there is more coming some weeks after the commodore set sail in this impregnable 
craft for valparaiso but he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale 
that begged a few confidential business with him that business consisted in fetching the craft 
such a thwack that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest 
port to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but i consider the interview 
with that whale as providential was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a 
similar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense i will now 
refer you to voyages for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer 
hereof langsdorff you must know by the way was attached to the russian admiral famous 
discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth 
chapter the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day 
we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather was 
very clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on 
our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it was not till 
the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an uncommon large whale 
the body of which was larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface 
of the water but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment 
when the ship which was in full sail was almost upon him so that it 
was impossible to prevent its striking against him we were thus placed in the most 
imminent danger as this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet 
at least out of the water the masts reeled and the sails fell altogether while 
we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck 
upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost 
gravity and solemnity captain applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the 
vessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily it 
had escaped entirely uninjured now the captain here alluded to as commanding the ship in 
question is a new englander who after a long life of unusual adventures as a 
sea captain this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston i have the 
honor of being a nephew of his i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage 
in langsdorff he substantiates every word the ship however was by no means a large 
one a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my uncle after 
bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home in that up and down 
manly book of old fashioned adventure so full too of honest voyage of lionel wafer 
one of ancient old found a little matter set down so like that just quoted 
from langsdorff that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such 
be needed lionel it seems was on his way to ferdinando as he calls the 
modern juan fernandes our way thither he says four in the morning when we were 
about one hundred and fifty leagues from the main of america our ship felt a 
terrible shock which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where 
they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and 
indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the 
ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little over we 
cast the lead and sounded but found no ground the suddenness of the shock made 
the guns leap in their carriages and several of the men were shaken out of 
their hammocks captain davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out 
of his cabin lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake and 
seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time 
did actually do great mischief along the spanish land but i should not much wonder 
if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after 
all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath i might proceed 
with several more examples one way or another known to me of the great power 
and malice at times of the sperm whale in more than one instance he has 
been known not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships but to 
pursue the ship itself and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its 
decks the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as 
for his strength let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached 
to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and 
secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a horse walks 
off with a cart again it is very often observed that if the sperm whale 
once struck is allowed time to rally he then acts not so often with blind 
rage as with wilful deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers nor is it without 
conveying some eloquent indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently open 
his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes but i 
must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most 
significant one by which you will not fail to see that not only is the 
most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but 
that these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that for 
the millionth time we say amen with there is nothing new under the sun in 
the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate of constantinople in the days when 
justinian was emperor and belisarius general as many know he wrote the history of his 
own times a work every way of uncommon value by the best authorities he has 
always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some one or two 
particulars not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned now in this history 
of his procopius mentions that during the term of his prefecture at constantinople a great 
sea monster was captured in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed 
vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years a 
fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid nor is there any 
reason it should be of what precise species this sea monster was is not mentioned 
but as he destroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been 
a whale and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale and i will 
tell you why for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been 
always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it even now i 
am certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the present 
constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious resort but further investigations have recently 
proved to me that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence 
of the sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that on 
the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a 
sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles hence a 
sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis 
in the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiar substance called 
brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have every 
reason to believe that the food of the sperm or cuttle at the bottom of 
that sea because large creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have 
been found at its surface if then you properly put these statements together and reason 
upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning sea 
monster that for half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor must in 
all probability have been a sperm whale chapter 46 surmises though consumed with the hot 
fire of his purpose ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view 
the ultimate capture of moby dick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests 
to that one passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and 
long habituation far too wedded to a fiery ways altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution 
of the voyage or at least if this were otherwise there were not wanting other 
motives much more influential with him it would be refining too much perhaps even considering 
his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended 
itself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew 
by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would 
prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed 
exceptionable there were still additional considerations which though not so strictly according with the wildness 
of his ruling passion yet were by no means incapable of swaying him to accomplish 
his object ahab must use tools and of all tools used in the shadow of 
the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew for example 
that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over starbuck yet that ascendency did 
not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership 
for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation 
body and coerced will were so long as ahab kept his magnet at brain still 
he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his quest 
and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it it might 
be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale was seen during that 
long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against 
his leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him not 
only that but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly 
manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that for the present the 
hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested 
it that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure 
background for few courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action that when they 
stood their long night watches his officers and men must have some nearer things to 
think of than moby dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed 
the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less 
capricious and live in the varying outer weather and they inhale its when retained for 
any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in 
the end it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene 
and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash nor was ahab unmindful of another 
thing in times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations but such times are 
evanescent the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought ahab is sordidness granting that 
the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing round 
their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight errantism in them still while for the 
love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food for 
their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old 
times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their 
holy sepulchre without committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious perquisites by the way 
had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic final and romantic object 
too many would have turned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought 
ahab of all hopes of cash they may scorn cash now but let some months 
go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent 
cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier ahab nor 
was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally having impulsively it 
is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the voyage 
ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open 
to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his 
crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to 
him and even violently wrest from him the command from even the barely hinted imputation 
of usurpation and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must 
of course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection could only consist in 
his own predominating brain and heart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attention 
to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected 
to for all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed 
here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to 
the natural nominal purpose of the voyage observe all customary usages and not only that 
but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit 
of his profession be all this as it may his voice was now often heard 
hailing the three mast heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look out and 
not omit reporting even a porpoise this vigilance was not long without reward chapter 47 
the mat maker it was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily lounging about 
the decks or vacantly gazing over into the lead coloured waters queequeg and i were 
mildly employed weaving what is called a sword mat for an additional lashing to our 
boat so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene and such 
an incantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into 
his own invisible self i was the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at 
the mat as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between 
the long yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and as 
queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads and 
idly looking off upon the water carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say 
so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over 
the sea only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed 
as if this were the loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanically 
weaving and weaving away at the fates there lay the fixed threads of the warp 
subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to 
admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own this warp seemed necessity 
and here thought i with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave 
my own destiny into these unalterable threads meantime impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof 
slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly as the case might be and by this 
difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the 
completed fabric this sword thought i which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and 
woof this easy indifferent sword must be chance free will and interweavingly working together the 
straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate every alternating vibration indeed 
only tending to that free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads 
and chance though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity and sideways 
in its motions directed by free will though thus prescribed to by both chance by 
turns rules either and has the last featuring blow at events thus we were weaving 
and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange long drawn and musically 
wild and unearthly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and i 
stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft 
in the cross trees was that mad gay header tashtego his body was reaching eagerly 
forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden intervals he continued 
his cries to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard 
all over the seas from hundreds of look outs perched as high in the air 
but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a 
marvellous cadence as from tashtego the as he stood hovering over you half suspended in 
air so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some 
prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate and by those wild cries announcing their 
coming she blows there there there she blows she blows away the lee beam about 
two miles off a school of them instantly all was commotion the sperm whale blows 
as a clock ticks with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity and thereby whalemen distinguish 
this fish from other tribes of his genus go flukes was now the cry from 
tashtego and the whales disappeared steward cried ahab time dough boy hurried below glanced at 
the watch and reported the exact minute to ahab the ship was now kept away 
from the wind and she went gently rolling before it tashtego reporting that the whales 
had gone down heading to leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in 
advance of our bows for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale 
when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while concealed beneath the surface 
mills round and swiftly swims off in the opposite deceitfulness of his could not now 
be in action for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by 
tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity 
one of the men selected for is those not appointed to the boats by this 
time relieved the indian at the main mast head the sailors at the fore and 
mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed in their places the cranes were 
thrust out the mainyard was backed and the three boats swung over the sea like 
three samphire baskets over high cliffs outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one 
hand clung to the rail while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale so 
look the long line of man of men about to throw themselves on board an 
ship but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye 
from the whale with a start all glared at dark ahab who was surrounded by 
five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air chapter 48 the first lowering 
the phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side of the 
deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the tackles and bands of the 
boat which swung there this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats 
though technically called the on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter the figure 
that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white tooth evilly 
protruding from its steel like lips a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested 
him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness 
was a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled round and round 
upon his head less swart in aspect the companions of this figure were of that 
vivid tiger yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillas race 
notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariners supposed to 
be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil their 
lord whose counting room they suppose to be elsewhere while yet the wondering company were 
gazing upon these strangers ahab cried out to the white turbaned old man at their 
head ready there fedallah was the half hissed reply away then hear shouting across the 
deck away there i say such was the thunder of his voice that spite of 
their amazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks 
with a wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a dexterous off 
handed daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors goat like leaped down the rolling 
side into the tossed boats below hardly had they pulled out from under the lee 
when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and 
showed the five strangers rowing ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed starbuck 
stubb and flask to spread themselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of 
water but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew 
the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command ahab said starbuck yourselves cried 
ahab way all four boats thou flask pull out more to leeward aye sir cheerily 
cried little king post sweeping round his great steering oar back addressing his crew again 
there she blows right ahead boys back heed yonder yellow boys archy i mind sir 
said archy knew it all before now i hear in the hold and i tell 
cabaco here of it what say ye cabaco they are stowaways mr flask pull my 
fine hearts alive pull my children pull my little ones drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb 
to his crew some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness you break your backbones 
my boys what is it you stare at those chaps in yonder boat tut they 
are only five more hands come to help mind from more the merrier pull then 
do pull never mind the are good fellows enough so so there you are now 
the stroke for a thousand pounds the stroke to sweep the stakes hurrah for the 
gold cup of sperm oil my heroes three cheers hearts alive easy easy be in 
a be in a hurry why you snap your oars you rascals bite something you 
dogs so so so then softly it long and strong give way there give way 
the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallions ye are all asleep stop snoring ye sleepers 
and pull pull will ye pull ye pull ye why in the name of gudgeons 
and ginger cakes ye pull and break something pull and start your eyes out here 
whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle son of ye draw his knife and 
pull with the blade between his teeth it now ye do something that looks like 
it my steel bits start her my silver spoons start her marling spikes exordium to 
his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of 
talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing but you 
must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright 
passions with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief peculiarity he would 
say the most terrific things to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of 
fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the 
fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life and 
yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked 
so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steering oar and so broadly mouthed 
at the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted 
like a charm upon the crew then again stubb was one of those odd sort 
of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on 
their guard in the matter of obeying them in obedience to a sign from ahab 
starbuck was now pulling obliquely across bow and when for a minute or so the 
two boats were pretty near to each other stubb hailed the mate starbuck larboard boat 
there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please returned starbuck turning round not 
a single inch as he spoke still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew his face 
set like a flint from think ye of those yellow boys sir on board somehow 
before the ship sailed strong strong boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking 
out loud again sad business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never 
mind mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what 
will spring my men spring hogsheads of sperm ahead mr stubb and what ye came 
for pull my boys sperm the play this at least is duty duty and profit 
hand in hand aye i thought as much soliloquized stubb when the boats diverged soon 
as i clapt eye on i thought so aye and what he went into the 
after hold for so often as dough boy long suspected they were hidden down there 
the white at the bottom of it well well so be it be helped all 
right give way men it the white whale to day give way now the advent 
of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats 
from the deck this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some 
of the company but fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them though 
indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event 
it took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this 
and confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from 
superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures 
as to dark precise agency in the matter from the beginning for me i silently 
recalled the mysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim 
nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah meantime ahab out 
of hearing of his officers having sided the furthest to windward was still ranging ahead 
of the other boats a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him those 
tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five trip hammers they 
rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which periodically started the boat along the 
water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who 
was seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed 
his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cut 
against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon while at the other end of the 
boat ahab with one arm like a thrown half backward into the air as if 
to counterbalance any tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as 
in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him all at once 
the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the five oars 
were seen simultaneously peaked boat and crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three 
spread boats in the rear paused on their way the whales had irregularly settled bodily 
down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from 
his closer vicinity ahab had observed it man look out along his oars cried starbuck 
queequeg stand up nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the 
savage stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where 
the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where 
it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale starbuck himself was seen coolly and 
adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently 
eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea not very far distant boat was also 
lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout 
sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the level 
of the stern platform it is used for catching turns with the whale line its 
top is not more spacious than the palm of a hand and standing upon such 
a base as that flask seemed perched at the mast head of some ship which 
had sunk to all but her trucks but little king post was small and short 
and at the same time little king post was full of a large and tall 
ambition so that this loggerhead stand point of his did by no means satisfy king 
post see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on 
to that upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way 
swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal a 
mast head as any sir will you mount i will and thank ye very much 
my fine fellow only i wish you fifty feet taller whereupon planting his feet firmly 
against two opposite planks of the boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his 
flat palm to foot and then putting hand on his hearse plumed head and bidding 
him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous fling landed the little man 
high and dry on his shoulders and here was flask now standing daggoo with one 
lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by at 
any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous 
habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even 
when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross running seas still more strange 
to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances but the sight 
of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious for sustaining himself with 
a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of 
the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxen haired flask seemed 
a snow flake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious 
little flask would now and then stamp with impatience but not one added heave did 
he thereby give to the lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping 
the living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons 
for that meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such far gazing solicitudes the whales 
might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright 
and if that were the case stubb as his wont in such cases it seems 
was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his 
hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed 
home the loading with his thumb end but hardly had he ignited his match across 
the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his harpooneer whose eyes had been setting 
to windward like two fixed stars suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to 
his seat crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry down all and give way 
they are to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have 
been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and 
thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like 
the confused scud from white rolling billows the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as 
it were like the air over intensely heated plates of iron beneath this atmospheric waving 
and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whales were swimming 
seen in advance of all the other indications the puffs of vapor they spouted seemed 
their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders all four boats were now in keen pursuit 
of that one spot of troubled water and air but it bade fair to outstrip 
them it flew on and on as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a 
rapid stream from the hills pull my good boys said starbuck in the lowest possible 
but intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes 
darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring 
binnacle compasses he did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew 
say anything to him only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced 
by one of his peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty how 
different the loud little king post out and say something my hearties roar and pull 
my thunderbolts beach me beach me on their black backs boys only do that for 
me and sign over to you my vineyard plantation boys including wife and children boys 
lay me me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad see 
see that white water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and 
stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon 
the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the stern like a crazed 
colt from the prairie at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with his unlighted 
short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed got fits that 
flask has fits yes give him the very fits into merrily merrily hearts alive pudding 
for supper you know the word pull all but what the devil are you hurrying 
about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and keep pulling nothing more crack 
all your backbones and bite your knives in all take it ye take it easy 
i say and burst all your livers and lungs but what it was that inscrutable 
ahab said to that tiger yellow crew of were words best omitted here for you 
live under the blessed light of the evangelical land only the infidel sharks in the 
audacious seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of 
red murder and foam glued lips ahab leaped after his prey meanwhile all the boats 
tore on the repeated specific allusions of flask to whale as he called the fictitious 
monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his bow with its allusions of his 
were at times so vivid and life like that they would cause some one or 
two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder but this was 
against all rule for the oarsmen must put out their eyes and ram a skewer 
through their necks usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears and no 
limbs but arms in these critical moments it was a sight full of quick wonder 
and awe the vast swells of the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made 
as they rolled along the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling green 
the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tip for an instant on 
the knife like edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatening to cut it 
in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows the keen spurrings 
and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sled like slide 
down its other side these with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and the 
shuddering gasps of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down 
upon her boats with outstretched sails like a wild hen after her screaming brood this 
was thrilling not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the 
fever heat of his first battle not the dead ghost encountering the first unknown phantom 
in the other world of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man 
does who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of 
the hunted sperm whale the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming 
more and more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud shadows flung 
upon the sea the jets of vapor no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right 
and left the whales seemed separating their wakes the boats were pulled more apart starbuck 
giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward our sail was now set and 
with the still rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through 
the water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being 
torn from the row locks soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of 
mist neither ship nor boat to be seen way men whispered starbuck drawing still further 
aft the sheet of his sail is time to kill a fish yet before the 
squall comes white water again to spring soon after two cries in quick succession on 
each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast but hardly were 
they overheard when with a lightning like hurtling whisper starbuck said up and queequeg harpoon 
in hand sprang to his feet though not one of the oarsmen was then facing 
the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on 
the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that 
the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty 
elephants stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist the 
waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents his hump 
there there give it to him whispered starbuck a short rushing sound leaped out of 
the boat it was the darted iron of queequeg then all in one welded commotion 
came an invisible push from astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge 
the sail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by something 
rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us the whole crew were half suffocated as 
they were tossed helter skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall squall whale 
and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped 
though completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed swimming round it we picked up the 
floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our places there we 
sat up to our knees in the sea the water covering every rib and plank 
so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown 
up to us from the bottom of the ocean the wind increased to a howl 
the waves dashed their bucklers together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around us 
like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in 
these jaws of death in vain we hailed the other boats as well roar to 
the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in 
that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew darker with the shadows of 
night no sign of the ship could be seen the rising sea forbade all attempts 
to bale out the boat the oars were useless as propellers performing now the office 
of life preservers so cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures 
starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif 
pole handed it to queequeg as the standard bearer of this forlorn hope there then 
he sat holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness there 
then he sat the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up 
hope in the midst of despair wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship 
or boat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on the mist still 
spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat 
suddenly queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear we all heard 
a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm the sound 
came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge vague form 
affrighted we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view 
bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length 
floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it tossed 
and gaped beneath the bows like a chip at the base of a cataract and 
then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it 
came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed against it by the 
seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on board ere the squall 
came close to the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to 
the ship in good time the ship had given us up but was still cruising 
if haply it might light upon some token of our perishing oar or a lance 
pole chapter 49 the hyena there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange 
mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast 
practical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspects that 
the joke is at expense but his own however nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth 
while disputing he bolts down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard 
things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles 
down bullets and gun flints and as for small difficulties and worryings prospects of sudden 
disaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only 
sly good natured hits and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and 
unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of comes over 
a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it comes in the very midst 
of his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing 
most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke there is nothing like 
the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy 
and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great 
white whale its object said i when they had dragged me the last man to 
the deck and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the 
water my fine friend does this sort of thing often happen without much emotion though 
soaked through just like me he gave me to understand that such things did often 
happen stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oil jacket 
was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain stubb i think i have heard 
you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate mr starbuck is 
by far the most careful and prudent i suppose then that going plump on a 
flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a 
discretion lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off cape horn flask 
said i turning to little king post who was standing close by are experienced in 
these things and i am not will you tell me whether it is an unalterable 
law in this fishery mr flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling 
himself back foremost into jaws you twist that smaller said flask the law i should 
like to see a crew backing water up to a whale face foremost ha ha 
the whale would give them squint for squint mind that here then from three impartial 
witnesses i had a deliberate statement of the entire case considering therefore that squalls and 
capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters of common occurrence 
in this kind of life considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on 
to the whale i must resign my life into the hands of him who steered 
the a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point 
of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to 
our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to driving on to his whale 
almost in the teeth of a squall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous for 
his great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent boat 
and finally considering in what a chase i was implicated touching the white whale taking 
all things together i say i thought i might as well go below and make 
a rough draft of my will said i along you shall be my lawyer executor 
and legatee it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at 
their last wills and testaments but there are no people in the world more fond 
of that diversion this was the fourth time in my nautical life that i had 
done the same thing after the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion i felt 
all the easier a stone was rolled away from my heart besides all the days 
i should now live would be as good as the days that lazarus lived after 
his resurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case 
might be i survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest 
i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience 
sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault now then thought i unconsciously rolling 
up the sleeves of my frock here goes for a cool collected dive at death 
and destruction and the devil fetch the hindmost chapter 50 boat and crew fedallah would 
have thought it flask cried stubb i had but one leg you would not catch 
me in a boat unless maybe to stop the plug hole with my timber toe 
oh a wonderful old man think it so strange after all on that account said 
flask his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing 
that would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the other 
left you know know that my little man i never yet saw him kneel among 
whale wise people it has often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his 
life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whaling captain to 
jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase so soldiers often argued with 
tears in their eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into 
the thickest of the fight but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering 
that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger 
considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties that every 
individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any 
maimed man to enter a whale boat in the hunt as a general thing the 
joint owners of the pequod must have plainly thought not ahab well knew that although 
his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively 
harmless vicissitudes of the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action 
and giving his orders in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually 
apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the all for captain ahab to be 
supplied with five extra men as that same crew he well knew that such generous 
conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the pequod therefore he had not 
solicited a crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on 
that head nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter 
until published discovery the sailors had little foreseen it though to be sure when after 
being a little while out of port all hands had concluded the customary business of 
fitting the whaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and then 
found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole pins with his own hands for 
what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even solicitously cutting the 
small wooden skewers which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove 
in the bow when all this was observed in him and particularly his solicitude in 
having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to 
make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety 
he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is sometimes 
called the horizontal piece in the bow for bracing the knee against in darting or 
stabbing at the whale when it was observed how often he stood up in that 
boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi circular depression in the cleat and 
with the chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all 
these things i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but almost 
everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view 
to the ultimate chase of moby dick for he had already revealed his intention to 
hunt that mortal monster in person but such a supposition did by no means involve 
the remotest suspicion as to any crew being assigned to that boat now with the 
subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonders soon wane 
besides now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from 
the unknown nooks and ash holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of 
whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about 
the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whaleboats canoes blown off japanese junks 
and what not that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into 
the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable excitement 
in the forecastle but be all this as it may certain it is that while 
the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were 
somehow distinct from them yet that hair turbaned fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the 
last whence he came in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccountable 
tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with peculiar fortunes nay so far as 
to have some sort of a half hinted influence heaven knows but it might have 
been even authority over him all this none knew but one cannot sustain an indifferent 
air concerning fedallah he was such a creature as civilized domestic people in the temperate 
zone only see in their dreams and that but dimly but the like of whom 
now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic communities especially the oriental isles to the 
east of the insulated immemorial unalterable countries which even in these modern days still preserve 
much of the ghostly aboriginalness of primal generations when the memory of the first man 
was a distinct recollection and all men his descendants unknowing whence he came eyed each 
other as real phantoms and asked of the sun and the moon why they were 
created and to what end when though according to genesis the angels indeed consorted with 
the daughters of men the devils also add the uncanonical rabbins indulged in mundane amours 
chapter 51 the spirit spout days weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory pequod 
had slowly swept across four several cruising grounds that off the azores off the cape 
de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth of the rio de 
la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from st helena it 
was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night when all 
the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver and by their soft suffusing seethings made 
what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery 
jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up 
by the moon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the 
sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight nights it was his wont 
to mount to the main mast head and stand a look out there with the 
same precision as if it had been day and yet though herds of whales were 
seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them 
you may think with what emotions then the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft 
at such unusual hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky but when 
after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound 
when after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moon lit 
jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted 
in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew she blows had the trump of judgment 
blown they could not have quivered more yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure 
for though it was a most unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and 
so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering walking the 
deck with quick side lunging strides ahab commanded the sails and royals to be set 
and every stunsail spread the best man in the ship must take the helm then 
with every mast head manned the piled up craft rolled down before the wind the 
strange upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails 
made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet while still she 
rushed along as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in to mount direct to heaven 
the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched face that 
night you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring while 
his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck every stroke of his dead 
limb sounded like a coffin tap on life and death this old man walked but 
though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager 
glances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night every sailor swore 
he saw it once but not a second time this midnight spout had almost grown 
a forgotten thing when some days after lo at the same silent hour it was 
again announced again it was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it 
once more it disappeared as if it had never been and so it served us 
night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jetted 
into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be disappearing again for one 
whole day or two days or three and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to 
be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever 
alluring us on nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance with 
the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested the pequod were there wanting 
some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried at however remote times 
or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast by one 
self same whale and that whale moby dick for a time there reigned too a 
sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition as if it were treacherously beckoning us 
on and on in order that the monster might turn round upon us and rend 
us at last in the remotest and most savage seas these temporary apprehensions so vague 
but so awful derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in 
which beneath all its blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm as for 
days and days we voyaged along through seas so wearily lonesomely mild that all space 
in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urn like 
prow but at last when turning to the eastward the cape winds began howling around 
us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are there when 
the ivory tusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in 
her madness till like showers of silver chips the foam flakes flew over her bulwarks 
then all this desolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sights more 
dismal than before close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and 
thither before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea ravens and every 
morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and spite of our 
hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our 
ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roosting place 
for their homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea as 
if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish 
and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred cape of good hope 
do they call ye rather cape tormentoso as called of yore for long allured by 
the perfidious silences that before had attended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented 
sea where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish seemed condemned to swim 
on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon 
but calm snow white and unvarying still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky 
still beckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried during 
all this blackness of the elements ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual 
command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than 
ever addressed his mates in tempestuous times like these after everything above and aloft has 
been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the 
gale then captain and crew become practical fatalists so with his ivory leg inserted into 
its accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab for hours and 
hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow 
would all but congeal his very eyelashes together meantime the crew driven from the forward 
part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood 
in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to guard against 
the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to 
the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt few or no words 
were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day 
after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves 
by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still 
in silence the men swung in the bowlines still wordless ahab stood up to the 
blast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in 
his hammock never could starbuck forget the old aspect when one night going down into 
the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sitting 
straight in his floor screwed chair the rain and half melted sleet of the storm 
from which he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat 
and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides 
and currents which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly clenched 
hand though the body was erect the head was thrown back so that the closed 
eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell tale that swung from a beam 
in the ceiling the cabin compass is called the tell tale because without going to 
the compass at the helm the captain while below can inform himself of the course 
of the ship terrible old man thought starbuck with a shudder sleeping in this gale 
still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose chapter 52 the albatross south eastward from the cape 
off the distant crozetts a good cruising ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead 
the goney albatross by name as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at 
the fore mast head i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to 
a tyro in the far ocean whaler at sea and long absent from home as 
if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a 
stranded walrus all down her sides this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of 
reddened rust while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of 
trees furred over with hoar frost only her lower sails were set a wild sight 
it was to see her long bearded look outs at those three mast heads they 
seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment that had 
survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they 
swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glided close 
under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each other 
that we might almost have leaped from the mast heads of one ship to those 
of the other yet those forlorn looking fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said 
not one word to our own look outs while the quarter deck hail was being 
heard from below ahoy have ye seen the white whale but as the strange captain 
leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the act of putting his trumpet to his 
mouth it somehow fell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising 
amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it meantime his ship was 
still increasing the distance between while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod 
were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the 
white name to another ship ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though 
he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind 
forbade but taking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and knowing 
by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and shortly bound home he 
loudly there this is the pequod bound round the world tell them to address all 
future letters to the pacific ocean and this time three years if i am not 
at home tell them to address them to at that moment the two wakes were 
fairly crossed and instantly then in accordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless 
fish that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side darted away 
with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselves fore and aft with the flanks though 
in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar 
sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings away from me 
do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water there seemed but little in the 
words but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man 
had ever before evinced but turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding 
the ship in the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old 
lion voice helm keep her off round the world round the world there is much 
in that sound to inspire proud feelings but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct only 
through numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that we left 
behind secure were all the time before us were this world an endless plain and 
by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet 
and strange than any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there were promise in 
the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in tormented 
chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims before all human hearts 
while chasing such over this round globe they either lead us on in barren mazes 
or midway leave us whelmed chapter 53 the gam the ostensible reason why ahab did 
not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and 
sea betokened storms but even had this not been the case he would not after 
all perhaps have boarded by his subsequent conduct on similar so it had been that 
by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he 
put for as it eventually turned out he cared not to consort even for five 
minutes with any stranger captain except he could contribute some of that information he so 
absorbingly sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of 
the peculiar usages of whaling vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas and especially 
on a common cruising ground if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york 
state or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering each other in 
such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of them cannot well avoid a mutual 
salutation and stopping for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for 
a while and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable 
pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whaling vessels descrying each other at 
the ends of the lone island or the far away mills how much more natural 
i say that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails but come 
into still closer more friendly and sociable contact and especially would this seem to be 
a matter of course in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose 
captains officers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other 
and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about for the long 
absent ship the outward bounder perhaps has letters on board at any rate she will 
be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two 
later than the last one on her blurred and thumb worn files and in return 
for that courtesy the outward bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the 
cruising ground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to 
her and in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each track 
on the cruising ground itself even though they are equally long absent from home for 
one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now 
far remote vessel and some of those letters may be for the people of the 
ship she now meets besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable 
chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors but likewise 
with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and 
perils nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is so long 
as both parties speak one language as is the case with americans and english though 
to be sure from the small number of english whalers such meetings do not very 
often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort 
of shyness between them for your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does 
not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english whalers sometimes 
affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer 
with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort of sea peasant but where this superiority in 
the english whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the 
yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than all the english collectively in ten 
years but this is a harmless little foible in the english whale hunters which the 
nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a 
few foibles himself so then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea 
the whalers have most reason to be they are so whereas some merchant ships crossing 
each wake in the mid atlantic will oftentimes pass on without so much as a 
single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace 
of dandies in broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each 
rig as for men of war when they chance to meet at sea they first 
go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings such a ducking of ensigns 
that there does not seem to be much right down hearty good will and brotherly 
love about it at all as touching slave ships meeting why they are in such 
a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible and as 
for pirates when they chance to cross each cross bones the first hail many skulls 
same way that whalers many barrels and that question once answered pirates straightway steer apart 
for they are infernal villains on both sides and like to see overmuch of each 
villanous likenesses but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable free and easy whaler 
what does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent 
weather she has a gam a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that 
they never heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of 
it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about and boilers and such 
like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchant seamen and also all pirates and 
man of men and slave ship sailors cherish such a scornful feeling towards whale ships 
this is a question it would be hard to answer because in the case of 
pirates say i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar 
glory about it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallows 
and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper 
foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude that in boasting himself to be high 
lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand 
on but what is a gam you might wear out your index finger running up 
and down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word dr johnson never attained 
to that erudition noah ark does not hold it nevertheless this same expressive word has 
now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees 
certainly it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with that view 
let me learnedly define it gam a social meeting of two or more whaleships generally 
on a cruising ground when after exchanging hails they exchange visits by crews the two 
captains remaining for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mates 
on the other there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten 
here all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so has the whale fishery 
in a pirate man of war or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere 
in his boat he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned 
seat there and often steers himself with a pretty little tiller decorated with gay cords 
and ribbons but the whale boat has no seat astern no sofa of that sort 
whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed if whaling captains were wheeled about 
the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs and as for a 
tiller the whale boat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming 
a complete crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer 
is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain 
having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like 
a pine tree and often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of 
the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships this 
standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his 
legs nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense 
projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the 
after oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thus completely wedged before 
and behind and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs 
but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him 
because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a spread angle of 
two poles and you cannot stand them up then again it would never do in 
plain sight of the riveted eyes it would never do i say for this straddling 
captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with 
his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant self command he generally carries his 
hands in his pockets but perhaps being generally very large heavy hands he carries them 
there for ballast nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too where the captain 
has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall seize 
hold of the nearest hair and hold on there like grim death chapter 54 the 
town story as told at the golden inn the cape of good hope and all 
the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corners of a 
great highway where you meet more travellers than in any other part it was not 
very long after speaking the goney that another homeward bound whaleman the town ho was 
encountered she was manned almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she 
gave us strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white 
whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town story which seemed obscurely 
to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so 
called judgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men this latter 
circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of 
the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of captain ahab or his 
mates for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the 
town ho himself it was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that 
ship one of whom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy 
but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it 
in that way that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest 
nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the pequod 
who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to 
call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among 
themselves so that it never transpired abaft the main mast interweaving in its proper place 
this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship the whole of 
this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record the ancient whale cry 
upon first sighting a whale from the mast head still used by whalemen in hunting 
the famous gallipagos terrapin for my sake i shall preserve the style in which i 
once narrated it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friends one eve 
smoking upon the thick gilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those fine cavaliers 
the young dons pedro and sebastian were on the closer terms with me and hence 
the interluding questions they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time two 
years prior to my first learning the events which i am about rehearsing to you 
gentlemen the town ho sperm whaler of nantucket was cruising in your pacific here not 
very many sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere 
to the northward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps according to daily 
usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common they 
supposed a sword fish had stabbed her gentlemen but the captain having some unusual reason 
for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very 
averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though 
indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was 
possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariners working at 
the pumps at wide and easy intervals but no good luck came more days went 
by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much 
so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the 
nearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired no 
small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance favoured he did not at 
all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pumps were of 
the best and being periodically relieved at them those six and thirty men of his 
could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her 
in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes 
the town ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without 
the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of 
radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and 
desperado from buffalo pray what is a lakeman and where is buffalo said don sebastian 
rising in his swinging mat of grass the eastern shore of our lake erie don 
crave your be you shall soon hear further of all that now gentlemen in square 
sail brigs and three masted ships well nigh as large and stout as any that 
ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the land 
locked heart of our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions 
popularly connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate those grand fresh water 
seas of ours and ontario and huron and superior and michigan an ocean like expansiveness 
with many of the noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races and 
of climes they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles even as the polynesian waters do 
in large part are shored by two great contrasting nations as the atlantic is they 
furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted all round 
their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries and by the goat like 
craggy guns of lofty mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories at 
intervals they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces flash from out 
their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests where 
the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies those same woods 
harboring wild afric beasts of prey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to 
tartar emperors they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland as well as winnebago 
villages they float alike the full rigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state 
the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as 
direful as any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are for out 
of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many a midnight ship with 
all its shrieking crew thus gentlemen though an inlander steelkilt was wild ocean born and 
wild ocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though 
in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to 
nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere 
atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social 
quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitudes of buck horn handled bowie knives 
yet was this nantucketer a man with some good hearted traits and this lakeman a 
mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered 
by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest right thus treated this 
steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all events he had proved so 
thus far but radney was doomed and made mad and gentlemen you shall hear was 
not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for 
her island haven that the town leak seemed again increasing but only so as to 
require an hour or more at the pumps every day you must know that in 
a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic for example some skippers think little of 
pumping their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer 
of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability would be 
that he and his shipmates would never again remember it on account of all hands 
gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you 
to the westward gentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their 
pump handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if 
it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded 
them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the 
way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel 
a little anxious this way had it been with the town ho so when her 
leak was found gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by 
several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the upper sails to 
be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze now this 
radney i suppose was as little of a coward and as little inclined to any 
sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land 
or on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen therefore when he betrayed this solicitude 
about the safety of the ship some of the seamen declared that it was only 
on account of his being a part owner in her so when they were working 
that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going 
on among them as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear 
water clear as any mountain spring bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and 
poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper holes as you well know 
it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of or otherwise that when 
a person placed in command over his fellow men finds one of them to be 
very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives 
an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down 
and pulverize that tower and make a little heap of dust of it be this 
conceit of mine as it may gentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and 
noble animal with a head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the 
tasseled housings of your last snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a 
soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he been born son to 
father but radney the mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn 
as malicious he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it the mate drawing near 
as he was toiling at the pump with the rest the lakeman affected not to 
notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings aye my merry lads a 
lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and have a taste by the 
lord worth bottling i tell ye what men old investment must go for it he 
had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home the fact 
is boys that sword fish only began the job come back again with a gang 
of ship carpenters saw fish and file fish and what not and the whole posse 
of are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements i 
suppose if old rad were here now tell him to jump overboard and scatter playing 
the devil with his estate i can tell him but a simple old soul and 
a beauty too boys they say the rest of his property is invested in looking 
glasses i wonder if give a poor devil like me the model of his nose 
your eyes that pump stopping for roared radney pretending not to have heard the talk 
away at it aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket boys lively now and 
with that the pump clanged like fifty fire engines the men tossed their hats off 
to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes 
the fullest tension of utmost energies the pump at last with the rest of his 
band the lakeman went forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his 
face fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow now 
what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed radney to meddle with such a man 
in that corporeally exasperated state i know not but so it happened intolerably striding along 
the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks 
and also a shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to 
run at large gentlemen sweeping a deck at sea is a piece of household work 
which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening it has 
been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time 
such gentlemen is the inflexibility of sea usages and the instinctive love of neatness in 
seamen some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in 
all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys if boys there 
be aboard besides it was the stronger men in the town ho that had been 
divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of 
them all steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he 
should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties such 
being the case with his comrades i mention all these particulars so that you may 
understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men there was more than this 
the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt 
as though radney had spat in his face any man who has gone sailor in 
a whale ship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman 
fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he sat still for a 
moment and as he steadfastly looked into the malignant eye and perceived the stacks of 
powder casks heaped up in him and the slow match silently burning along towards them 
as he instinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the 
deeper passionateness in any already ireful repugnance most felt when felt at all by really 
valiant men even when nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole over steelkilt in his ordinary tone 
only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him 
saying that sweeping the deck was not his business and he would not do it 
and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as 
the customary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or nothing 
all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous 
manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an uplifted 
club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by and irritated as he 
was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for all his first nameless feeling of 
forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow 
still smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat 
till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his 
face furiously commanding him to do his bidding rose and slowly retreating round the windlass 
steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to 
obey seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest effect by an awful and 
unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but 
it was to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round 
the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had 
now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatches 
and thus spoke to the officer radney i will not obey you take that hammer 
away or look to yourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where 
the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth 
meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions retreating not the thousandth part of an inch 
stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his 
right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the 
hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him but gentlemen the fool had 
been branded for the slaughter by the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the 
next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell 
on the hatch spouting blood like a whale the cry could go aft steelkilt was 
shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were 
standing their mastheads they were both canallers cried don pedro have seen many whale ships 
in our harbours but never heard of your canallers pardon who and what are they 
don are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal you must have heard of 
it senor hereabouts in this dull warm most lazy and hereditary land we know but 
little of your vigorous north well then don refill my cup your very fine and 
ere proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are for such information may 
throw side light upon my story three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire 
breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages 
through long dismal uninhabited swamps and affluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiard room 
and bar room through the holy of holies of great forests on roman arches over 
indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or broken through all the wide 
contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk counties and especially by rows of snow white chapels 
whose spires stand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often 
lawless life your true ashantee gentlemen there howl your pagans where you ever find them 
next door to you under the long flung shadow and the snug patronising lee of 
churches for by some curious fatality as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters 
that they ever encamp around the halls of justice so sinners gentlemen most abound in 
holiest vicinities that a friar passing said don pedro looking downwards into the crowded plazza 
with humorous concern for our northern friend dame inquisition wanes in lima laughed don sebastian 
senor moment pardon cried another of the company the name of all us limeese i 
but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no means overlooked 
your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison oh 
do not bow and look surprised you know the proverb all along this as lima 
it but bears out your saying too churches more plentiful than billiard tables and for 
ever as lima so too venice i have been there the holy city of the 
blessed evangelist st mark dominic purge it your cup thanks here i refill now you 
pour out again depicted in his own vocation gentlemen the canaller would make a fine 
dramatic hero so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he like mark antony for days and 
days along his green turfed flowery nile he indolently floats openly toying with his red 
cheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck but ashore all this effeminacy 
is dashed the brigandish guise which the canaller so proudly sports his slouched and gaily 
ribboned hat betoken his grand features a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages 
through which he floats his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities 
once a vagabond on his own canal i have received good turns from one of 
these canallers i thank him heartily would fain be not ungrateful but it is often 
one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence that at times he 
has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to 
plunder a wealthy one in sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is 
is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whale fishery contains so many of its 
most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so 
much distrusted by our whaling captains nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of 
this matter that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along 
its line the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly 
reaping in a christian corn field and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric 
seas see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles 
need to travel the one lima i had thought now that at your temperate north 
the generations were cold and holy as the hills the story left off gentlemen where 
the lakeman shook the backstay hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by 
the three junior mates and the four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck 
but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the uproar 
and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the 
sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out 
of way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale pike calling upon 
his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarter deck 
at intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying 
into the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of 
his resentment but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded 
in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large casks in 
a line with the windlass these sea parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade out of 
that ye pirates roared the captain now menacing them with a pistol in each hand 
just brought to him by the steward out of that ye cut throats leaped on 
the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do 
but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his death would be the signal for 
a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart lest this 
might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgents 
instantly to return to their duty you promise not to touch us if we do 
demanded their ringleader to turn to make no promise your duty do you want to 
sink the ship by knocking off at a time like this turn to and he 
once more raised a pistol the ship cried steelkilt let her sink not a man 
of us turns to unless you swear not to raise a rope yarn against us 
what say ye men turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was their response lakeman 
now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye on the captain and jerking 
out such sentences as these not our fault we want it i told him to 
take his hammer away it was business he might have known me before this i 
told him not to prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here 
against his cursed jaw those mincing knives down in the forecastle there men look to 
those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to yourself say the word be a 
fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and your 
men but we be flogged to i make no promises turn to i say ye 
now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him are a few of us 
here and i am one of them who have shipped for the cruise see now 
as you well know sir we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor 
is down so we want a row not our interest we want to be peaceable 
we are ready to work but we be flogged to roared the captain glanced round 
him a moment and then said tell you what it is now captain rather than 
kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal we lift a hand against 
ye unless ye attack us but till you say the word about not flogging us 
we do a turn into the forecastle then down with ye keep ye there till 
sick of it down ye go we cried the ringleader to his men most of 
them were against it but at length in obedience to steelkilt they preceded him down 
into their dark den growlingly disappearing like bears into a cave the bare head was 
just level with the planks the captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly 
drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and 
loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway 
then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something down the crack closed it 
and turned the key upon in on deck some twenty or more who thus far 
had remained neutral night a wide awake watch was kept by all the officers forward 
and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it 
was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below but the hours 
of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard 
at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded 
through the ship sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the 
prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was then lowered down to 
them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it when again turning 
the key upon them and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarter deck twice 
every day for three days this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused 
wrangling and then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly 
four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to the 
fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears of 
ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated 
his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to 
stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth morning three others 
of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought 
to restrain them only three were left turn to now said the captain with a 
heartless jeer us up again will ye cried steelkilt certainly said the captain and the 
key clicked was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection of seven of 
his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him and 
maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair 
it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers thus far apparently of one 
mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the 
garrison and armed with their keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a handle 
at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any 
devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he would do this he said 
whether they joined him or not that was the last night he should spend in 
that den but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other 
two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for 
anything in short but a surrender and what was more they each insisted upon being 
the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come but 
to this their leader as fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly as his 
two comrades would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both 
of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at 
a time and here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants must come out hearing 
the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted 
it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking 
out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the 
ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit 
but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last they 
in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secret treacheries together 
and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other 
in three sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords and 
shrieked out for the captain at midnight murder at hand and smelling in the dark 
for the blood he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle 
in a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still 
struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies who at once 
claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder but 
all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by 
side were seized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there 
they hung till morning ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them vultures 
would not touch ye ye villains sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who 
had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the 
former that he had a good mind to flog them all upon the whole he 
would do ought demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would 
let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular as for 
you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in the you i mean to 
mince ye up for the try pots and seizing a rope he applied it with 
all his might to the backs of the two traitors till they yelled no more 
but lifelessly hung their heads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn wrist is 
sprained with ye he cried at last there is still rope enough left for you 
my fine bantam that give up take that gag from his mouth and let us 
hear what he can say for himself a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous 
motion of his cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a 
sort of hiss i say is mind it you flog me i murder you ye 
so then see how ye frighten the captain drew off with the rope to strike 
not hissed the lakeman i must the rope was once more drawn back for the 
stroke here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain who to the amazement 
of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly two or three times and then 
suddenly throwing down his rope said do him him down hear as the junior mates 
were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested the 
chief mate ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning 
hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched 
the whole scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak 
but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared 
not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe are a coward 
hissed the lakeman i am but take that the mate was in the very act 
of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing no 
more made good his word spite of threat whatever that might have been the three 
men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the 
moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as before after dark that day when one watch 
had retired below a clamor was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors 
running up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew entreaties 
cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own instance they were 
put down in the run for salvation still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the 
rest on the contrary it seemed that mainly at instigation they had resolved to maintain 
the strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the ship reached port 
desert her in a body but in order to insure the speediest end to the 
voyage they all agreed to another not to sing out for whales in case any 
should be discovered for spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils 
the town ho still maintained her mast heads and her captain was just as willing 
to lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck 
the cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth 
for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital 
jaw of the whale though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort 
of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all was 
over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him 
in the ventricles of his heart he was in radney the chief watch and as 
if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom 
after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain 
upon resuming the head of his watch at night upon this and one or two 
other circumstances steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge the night radney had an 
unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter deck and leaning his arm 
upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the 
side in this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was a considerable 
vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this was the sea steelkilt 
calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round 
at two in the morning of the third day from that in which he had 
been betrayed at his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in 
his watches below are you making there said a shipmate do you think what does 
it look like a lanyard for your bag but an odd one seems to me 
rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at length before him i think it will 
answer shipmate i enough twine you any there was none in the forecastle i must 
get some from old rad and he rose to go aft mean to go a 
begging to him said a sailor not do you think he do me a turn 
when to help himself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked 
at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was 
given twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely 
netted partly rolled from the pocket of the monkey jacket as he was tucking the 
coat into his hammock for a pillow twenty four hours after his trick at the 
silent to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug 
to the fatal hour was then to come and in the fore ordaining soul of 
steelkilt the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed 
in gentlemen a fool saved the would be murderer from the bloody deed he had 
planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger for by a mysterious 
fatality heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its 
own the damning thing he would have done was just between daybreak and sunrise of 
the morning of the second day when they were washing down the decks that a 
stupid teneriffe man drawing water in the main chains all at once shouted out she 
rolls there she rolls jesu what a whale it was moby dick dick cried don 
sebastian dominic sir sailor but do whales have christenings whom call you moby dick very 
white and famous and most deadly immortal monster don that would be too long a 
story how cried all the young spaniards crowding dons nay i cannot rehearse that now 
let me get more into the air sirs chicha the chicha cried don pedro vigorous 
friend looks faint up his empty glass need gentlemen one moment and i proceed gentlemen 
so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the of the compact among 
the the excitement of the moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his 
voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld 
from the three sullen mast heads all was now a phrensy white white whale was 
the cry from captain mates and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious 
to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and 
with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a 
horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea 
gentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped 
out before the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman of the mate 
and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him while 
radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the 
line at the word of command moreover when the four boats were lowered the got 
the start and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt as he strained 
at his oar after a stiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand 
radney sprang to the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a 
boat and now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the topmost back nothing 
loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two 
whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and 
keeling over spilled out the standing mate that instant as he fell on the slippery 
back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while radney was tossed 
over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through 
the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to 
remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round in a 
sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged 
headlong again and went down at the first tap of the bottom the lakeman had 
slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he 
thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought 
his knife to the line he cut it and the whale was free but at 
some distance moby dick rose again with some tatters of red woollen shirt caught in 
the teeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the whale 
eluded them and finally wholly disappeared good time the town ho reached her savage solitary 
no civilized creature resided there headed by the lakeman all but five or six of 
the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large 
double war canoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor company being 
reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in 
the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak but to such 
unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by 
night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon 
the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that 
the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel after taking 
counsel with his officers he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible loaded 
and ran out his two cannon from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop 
and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man 
with him and setting the sail of his best whale boat steered straight before the 
wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew the 
fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed to have touched 
at a low isle of corals he steered away from it but the savage craft 
bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to 
or he would run him under water the captain presented a pistol with one foot 
on each prow of the yoked war canoes the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring 
him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury 
him in bubbles and foam do you want of me cried the captain are you 
bound and for what are you bound demanded steelkilt lies am bound to tahiti for 
more men good let me board you a come in peace with that he leaped 
from the canoe swam to the boat and climbing the gunwale stood face to face 
with the captain your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me as 
soon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonder island and 
remain there six days if i do not may lightnings strike me pretty scholar laughed 
the lakeman senor and leaping into the sea he swam back to his comrades the 
boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa 
nut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at tahiti his own 
place of destination there luck befriended him two ships were about to sail for france 
and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed 
they embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he 
been at all minded to work them legal retribution ten days after the french ships 
sailed the whale boat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the 
more civilized tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small native 
schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed 
his cruisings steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of nantucket the 
widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead 
still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him you through said don 
sebastian quietly am don i entreat you tell me if to the best of your 
own convictions this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful 
did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to 
press bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in don suit 
cried the company with exceeding interest there a copy of the holy evangelists in the 
golden inn gentlemen said don sebastian i know a worthy priest near by who will 
quickly procure one for me i go for it but are you well advised this 
may grow too serious you be so good as to bring the priest also don 
there are no auto da fés in lima now said one of the company to 
another fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy let us withdraw more out 
of the moonlight i see no need of this me for running after you don 
sebastian but may i also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest 
sized evangelists you can is the priest he brings you the evangelists said don sebastian 
gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure me remove my hat now venerable priest 
further into the light and hold the holy book before me that i may touch 
it help me heaven and on my honor the story i have told ye gentlemen 
is in substance and its great items true i know it to be true it 
happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i have seen 
and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney chapter 55 of the monstrous pictures 
of whales i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without 
canvas something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the 
eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside 
the whale ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there it may be 
worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even 
down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time 
to set the world right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale 
all wrong it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will 
be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures for ever since those inventive 
but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples the pedestals of statues and 
on shields medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain armor 
like and a helmeted head like st ever since then has something of the same 
sort of license prevailed not only in most popular pictures of the whale but in 
many scientific presentations of him now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways 
purporting to be the is to be found in the famous cavern pagoda of elephanta 
in india the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda 
all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any 
of them actually came into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble 
profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth the hindoo whale referred to occurs 
in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form 
of leviathan learnedly known as the matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man 
and half whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that 
small section of him is all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of 
an anaconda than the broad palms of the true majestic flukes but go to the 
old galleries and look now at a great christian portrait of this fish for he 
succeeds no better than the antediluvian hindoo it is picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from 
the sea monster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange 
creature as that nor does hogarth in painting the same scene in his own descending 
make out one whit better the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the 
surface scarcely drawing one inch of water it has a sort of howdah on its 
back and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling might be taken 
for the gate leading from the thames by water into the tower then there are 
the prodromus whales of old scotch sibbald and whale as depicted in the prints of 
old bibles and the cuts of old primers what shall be said of these as 
for the book whale winding like a vine stalk round the stock of a descending 
stamped and gilded on the backs and title pages of many books both old and 
is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature imitated i take it from the like 
figures on antique vases though universally denominated a dolphin i
